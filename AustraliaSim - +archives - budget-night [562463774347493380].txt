ü¶Ä budget night ü¶Ä


[02-Apr-19 04:41 PM] FuckCorona#5914
Lets see how much the government is fucking the taxpayer this financial year.


[02-Apr-19 04:41 PM] BHjr132#2979
description says "Open 4:30pm AEDT" and it is now 5:10pm AEDT so i have opened the floodgates


[02-Apr-19 04:41 PM] FuckCorona#5914
2 hours 19 minutes to go!


[02-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Etotoc#7989
Is it on at 7:30pm?


[02-Apr-19 04:41 PM] FuckCorona#5914
Tonight is the night we go from the hardest, most erect harrelson to a sloppy soft socialist


[02-Apr-19 04:41 PM] Youmaton#1190
@FuckCorona cant wait for the government to get a "surplus" but slashing services and then bribing everyone with a little bit of money


[02-Apr-19 04:42 PM] Etotoc#7989
@FuckCorona will probs be watching budget with Angus


[02-Apr-19 04:42 PM] FuckCorona#5914
Fucc


[02-Apr-19 04:42 PM] FuckCorona#5914
and @Youmaton I only agree with slashing services if there is some incentive (tax cut) to go private


[02-Apr-19 04:43 PM] FuckCorona#5914
for an EXAMPLE, if theyre slashing healthcare to slash healthcare but not give total tax incentive (2% levy is not enough) then I disagree


[02-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok


[02-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Hopefully, it's a surplus. ScoMo better keep his word and not increase taxes


[02-Apr-19 04:43 PM] FuckCorona#5914
Healthcare is just the easiest one for me to go to tbh, could be anything


[02-Apr-19 04:43 PM] Etotoc#7989

[02-Apr-19 04:44 PM] FuckCorona#5914
Like privatising roads without lowering rego at a state level Id be pissed off too


[02-Apr-19 04:44 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948

100% funds allocated to blobcat cultivation


[02-Apr-19 04:44 PM] FuckCorona#5914
thats not fed so its moot tonight


[02-Apr-19 04:44 PM] FuckCorona#5914
All i know is that no one is going to be happy with this budget, just like every year.


[02-Apr-19 04:44 PM] imnofox#2340
I hope they nationalise the banks


[02-Apr-19 04:44 PM] FuckCorona#5914
lol no


[02-Apr-19 04:45 PM] imnofox#2340
ScoMo better not let me down


[02-Apr-19 04:45 PM] FuckCorona#5914
The royal commission into banks can be summed up as "people did not read contracts and got fucked hard"


[02-Apr-19 04:45 PM] imnofox#2340
I hope they nationalise the energy companies


[02-Apr-19 04:45 PM] FuckCorona#5914
If they go nuclear Ill be fine with that tbh, means lower energy bills


[02-Apr-19 04:45 PM] BHjr132#2979
I hope they nationalise the environment


[02-Apr-19 04:45 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
The budget should spend $3.50


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Youmaton#1190
ah yes thats why they kept charging a dead person


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
To get me an ice coffee


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Youmaton#1190
banks *totally* wernt at fault


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] FuckCorona#5914
@Youmaton Family should've told the bank they ded


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] imnofox#2340
I hope they nationalise the Labor Party


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] Etotoc#7989
Josh Frydenburger will give more money to (((Western Asia aid)))


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] BHjr132#2979

Can we eat the Labor and greens


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] FuckCorona#5914

[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] ManlyKitten#6380

[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] imnofox#2340
I hope they nationalise AusSim


[02-Apr-19 04:46 PM] FuckCorona#5914
instead of neglected to notify the bank that theyre dead


[02-Apr-19 04:47 PM] FuckCorona#5914
therefore, fees to dead people in bounds of the contract signed


[02-Apr-19 04:47 PM] imnofox#2340
I hope when I die my family remembers to cancel my Prawnhub subscription


[02-Apr-19 04:47 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948

[02-Apr-19 04:48 PM] BHjr132#2979
royal commission into Pronhub for charging dead imno for his subscription


[02-Apr-19 04:48 PM] FuckCorona#5914
@imnofox tbh if their cards were cancelled they would just cancel the sub when it stops being paid


[02-Apr-19 04:49 PM] imnofox#2340

[02-Apr-19 04:59 PM] FuckCorona#5914
Its right if you look at the policies modern socialists do advocate for


[02-Apr-19 05:00 PM] FuckCorona#5914
Its wrong if you look at the strict, to the letter definition of socialism


[02-Apr-19 05:00 PM] FuckCorona#5914
Its like any other political theory, its evolved over time


[02-Apr-19 05:05 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
worker control over the means of production if consented by the owners of the means of production is epic

[02-Apr-19 05:06 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
"what if the means of production consents tho" is an epic take


[02-Apr-19 05:06 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
bruh my "cock" is one star off the board


[02-Apr-19 05:06 PM] FuckCorona#5914

Hey guys, BHjr here and welcome to my channel trailer. On this channel I'll be doing Minecraft videos. I'm also starting a channel for Club Penguin and maybe a Poptropica channel. I might also be doing some Moshie Monsters and maybe some other games, since Farming Simulator I have bought so I might do stuff on there. So hopefully you like, comment, and subscribe to my channel.

[02-Apr-19 09:59 PM] Eehee#6658
esp wrt the lower needs from the NDIS


[02-Apr-19 09:59 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
they're able to do it as the government has the highest amount of revenue they ever had


[02-Apr-19 09:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
right so "less needs from NDIS" = the NDIS is giving less out because they are stooges.

[02-Apr-19 10:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the ndis is a good system done poorly


[02-Apr-19 10:02 PM] Eehee#6658
i agree, but as to the specifics is what i'm curious on


[02-Apr-19 10:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
because people got in the way


[02-Apr-19 10:02 PM] Eehee#6658
what in particular makes it poorly-done?


[02-Apr-19 10:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it requires a human determining if each item on a plan is 'fair and reasonable'


[02-Apr-19 10:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and that changes between humans


[02-Apr-19 10:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
you could have two participants with the same requests and reasoning, one would get approved and the other knocked back, based on who reviewed it and what region they live in (I've heard that money is tighter in Brisbane compared to CQ, for example.)


[02-Apr-19 10:04 PM] Eehee#6658
that's fair enough -- i won't claim to know anything about that, i was rather scoping out where your argument came from and whether in general you were against services for disabled people etc being properly, fully funded rather than thin-pursed


[02-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
oh I love the NDIS


[02-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it has given me so much


[02-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Eehee#6658
bless, then üôè ‚ù§


[02-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but it just is a poor system


[02-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Eehee#6658
it's always hard to tell at first what angle someone is taking when they say something like "the NDIS has problems" because they could be going either "it's a great system and should be given more care" or "it's useless bullshit and we should defund it"


[02-Apr-19 10:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
or a poor application of the system


[02-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it is too slow at times


[02-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it doesn't handle a change in a person, such as if their disability changes over a short period of time


[02-Apr-19 10:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
or if circumstances change


[02-Apr-19 10:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
ie: if one of my parents were to drop dead right now, I'd have to get a plan review to get more funding for carers. A plan review can take 2 or 3 months. If my current plan was already low, thats 2-3 months I either have to go rough, or spend my own cash from, which is the opposite of what the NDIS stands for


[02-Apr-19 10:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and no doubt there will be stories of this in the RC


[02-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Eehee#6658
that's fucking infuriating


[02-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Eehee#6658
i hope the RC dredges all the trash up nicely honestly


[02-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think it could be worse than the aged care and banking RCs


[02-Apr-19 10:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[02-Apr-19 10:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[02-Apr-19 10:10 PM] Eehee#6658

[02-Apr-19 10:11 PM] Eehee#6658
physical, verbal, or whatever


[02-Apr-19 10:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and there is high unemployment in disability, and the ones who do get a job get treated like crap


[02-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Eehee#6658
*yup*


[02-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Eehee#6658
like


[02-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Eehee#6658
i have to be very specific with the sorts of jobs i can do


[02-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Eehee#6658
i'd like to be a psychologist someday and i think i can handle that when it comes to it because that's generally one-on-one in a fairly reasonably-sized room and i can hear people there


[02-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Eehee#6658
but i can't work customer service or in a kitchen or whatever


[02-Apr-19 10:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
or industrail


[02-Apr-19 10:13 PM] Eehee#6658
i've basically gotta limit myself to loading trucks or such


[02-Apr-19 10:13 PM] Eehee#6658
anything that's done in solitude is probably what i'll need to do


[02-Apr-19 10:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well I'll be limited to office type jobs


[02-Apr-19 10:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I can't do manual labour


[02-Apr-19 10:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well, I might be able to push boxes with my chair


[02-Apr-19 10:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

üôè üòì


[02-Apr-19 10:14 PM] Eehee#6658
honestly in general it's so frustrating how like, finding other people with your condition is basically impossible


[02-Apr-19 10:15 PM] Eehee#6658
there's such a thing as cultural Deafness with a capital D and this whole big-ass community i didn't know about until a year and a half ago


[02-Apr-19 10:15 PM] Eehee#6658
and it's impossible to find any sorts of accounts on "hey yes this is also a thing i experience with this condition" in general


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Eehee#6658
like we discuss trans rights and sexuality and race and all that sort of stuff


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Eehee#6658
but disability?


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Eehee#6658
nope


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
exactly


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Eehee#6658
it's improving a little but like


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Eehee#6658
*slowly*


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
disabled people are the opressed minority


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
not lgbti


[02-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Eehee#6658
i would honestly say that disabled discourse progresses at far slower a speed than trans discourse


[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Eehee#6658
and i absolutely love that trans discourse does as well as it does, too


[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Eehee#6658
and it should do so much better also


[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
trans has done so well compared to disabled


[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Eehee#6658
and i can't wait for that shit


[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Eehee#6658
but damn


[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Eehee#6658
no-one gives a shit about disability


[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Eehee#6658
even basic fucking accessibility shit people can't be bothered to accommodate


[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[02-Apr-19 10:17 PM] Eehee#6658

[02-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Eehee#6658
also like on this general point, *nothing* pisses me off more than me mentioning "hey i'm deaf, you'll have to face me and speak clearly - not loudly though! thanks haha" and for them to like


[02-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Eehee#6658
comply for all of 15 seconds


[02-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Eehee#6658
before turning around and mumbling into a corner


[02-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Eehee#6658
and me needing to go "what?" twenty times over the course of the next couple minutes


[02-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Eehee#6658

[02-Apr-19 10:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

and it's like


[02-Apr-19 10:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
can I get one of those army drones so I can shoot people who get in the way


[02-Apr-19 10:21 PM] Eehee#6658
sort of infuriatingly hilarious to realise that most people would sooner yell at someone for getting out of a wheelchair than they would think about why that might be


[02-Apr-19 10:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

The whole model of "winners" and "losers" is just something cooked up to help structure LNP propaganda. Notice how small businesses are "winners" in every Liberal budget?
