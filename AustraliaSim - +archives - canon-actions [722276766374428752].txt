*Before politics, Morrison was an ad man. He won a supposedly unwinnable election by turning it into a one-man marketing exercise. But while he constructed and maintained a simulacrum of himself that could thrive in the world‚Äôs steady descent into neofascist hell, another version of ‚ÄúScoMo‚Äù metastasized on the internet. One in which a younger Scott Morrison, driving back from a football game one night in 1997, explosively shit his pants at a McDonald‚Äôs in the southern Sydney suburb of Engadine.*

*The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries.*

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky Rommel only wanted to give you a warning‚Äù said the guard leading. 

‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs nice that like‚Äù, I say, walking passed the opened door of the security room where I peer in and find the guards sitting on folding deck chairs. 

‚ÄúAre they playing poker?‚Äù I ask 

‚ÄúYeah, off duty‚Äù answered the guard, ‚Äúwhat do you do?‚Äù He followed. 

I look at him, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be a funny question in a couple of days. What‚Äôs the buy-in?‚Äù 

One of the off-duty guards from inside looks up, ‚ÄúThirty. Want in?‚Äù 

Silence, for a heartbeat.

*Walks with @Lucifer Morningstar  through the High Court building, counsel and personnel smile at the two of us politely and quietly say their congratulations. We return the smiles as we walk to our chambers. Outside, the view looks out over Canberra. 

‚ÄúOh lord, look at this‚Äù, I say, gazing over the chambers walls. ‚ÄúEither this wallpaper goes or I do‚Äù. 

‚ÄúLeave then, you have work to do and this is my chambers‚Äù Lucifer replies, setting their legal tomes on the desk. 

I slowly sulk away to my own chambers. 

‚ÄúAlso JarJar‚Äù yells Lucifer from down the hall.

I look up, turn around hopefully. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask Hubert for another coffee‚Äù, they say flatly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a legal assistant, not a maid. Also, he‚Äôs my assistant.‚Äù 

I lower my head and walk even slower to my chambers down the hall with the slightly less enticing view. As I pass him, I ask Hubert to bring me a juice. Juice isn‚Äôt coffee.*

*In the HCA library typing furiously away on laptop. Late at night, the only company I have are the old legal tomes on the shelves. 

Suddenly, a wild @Lucifer Morningstar  appears, books in arms. I scramble and highlight all my work, deleting everything immediately and closes Microsoft word.  

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here so late?‚Äù, asks Lucifer, arms straining against the weight of the books. 

‚ÄúLegal things, jurisprudence stuff, the whole shebang‚Äù I reply, ‚Äúwhat about you, do you actually eat or sleep?‚Äù 

Lucifer snickers and says matter-of factly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to eat or sleep. The law sustains me‚Äù. 

‚ÄúRight...‚Äù I reply, unsure. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not writing HCA fanfic again are you?‚Äù, they ask suspiciously. 

‚ÄúMe?‚Äù I reply, ‚Äúof course not, I am a professional‚Äù. 

‚ÄúShame‚Äù, says Lucifer, ‚Äúthey were entertaining‚Äù. With that, they walk away. 

I look down at my deleted HCA fanfiction. Slowly deflating and resting my head in my arms. I press the intercom. 

‚ÄúHubert, make that two coffee‚Äôs please‚Äù 

‚ÄúOf course, your honour‚Äù, comes the voice from the intercom. 

‚ÄúAlso Hubert, I hate you‚Äù. 

‚ÄúYes, Sir‚Äù.*

*As he pushes a shopping trolley through the fresh produce aisle, Griffo finds himself lost in thought. Not because he‚Äôd had a particularly stressful day in parliament, mind you. No, he just can‚Äôt stop wondering how the hell his local Stocklands got that car inside the shopping centre. It wasn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôd seen a show car in a shopping centre but it was the first time he‚Äôd given some thought to it.*

**‚ÄùDo they cut open the doors?‚Äù** *muses Griffo aloud to no one in particular,* **‚Äùor do they build the car inside the shopping centre?‚Äù**

*Pausing to pick up and admire a tomato, Griffo gives it a good, heartfelt squeeze before setting it down again.*

**‚ÄùDo they turn it on its side? Maybe some sick cunt just two wheels it through?‚Äù**

*As he exits Woolies, Griffo double checks his receipt to see if he‚Äôs earned enough points on the fuel reward system. When he can‚Äôt quite see the fine print at the bottom, he angles the receipt towards the large beam of light throwing from the roof ‚Äì which is when he notices the skylight for the first time.*

**‚ÄùSo that‚Äôs how they do it‚Äù**, *whispers Griffo, shaking his head in disbelief,* **‚Äúcheeky bastards.‚Äù**

**‚ÄùThey lower it in.‚Äù**

*Walks around parliament gardens by night, moonlight streaming through dark clouds cascading under the dark sky. All is quiet, and still. Only the few possums run to and fro around the shrubbery. I stop and lookout over the twilight of small lights that make up Canberra-proper. I take a deep breath, taking in the cool air. 

‚ÄúThis place fucking sucks‚Äù, I say to myself, exhaling.*

*As Griffo sits in the parliamentary cafe, he proudly admits to himself that he only checks his ex-campaign manager‚Äôs (yes the one that lost him Cowper and and an election) relationship status ‚Äòonce every two months or so.‚Äô*

*Despite leaving out the fact he regularly looks up his entire family and friendship circle, including a step-mother he never even met, Griffo insists to his office that he‚Äôs moving on with his life just fine.*

*However, after a night out on the town, Griffo found herself sitting in the darkness of her room, drunkenly scrolling through his ex-campaign manager‚Äôs Instagram for clues that he was going on a regret fuelled bender.*

*Unfortunately for Griffo, his latest pics included mostly shots of a friendship group he  was never invited to in and a gym selfie where he was looking especially ‚Äòswol‚Äô.*

**‚ÄùWhy do I do this to myself‚Äù**, *moans Griffo as he navigates his profile with surgeon-like precision.*

**‚ÄúI got him that fucking shirt.‚Äù**

**‚ÄùDoes that mean something? That he still wears it?‚Äù**

**‚ÄùOh god I should stop.‚Äù** *In a haste to exit his feed, Griffo accidentally clicks on his Instagram story which is stupidly located right next to the back button.*

**‚ÄùFUCK.‚Äù ‚ÄúFUCK FUCK FUCK NO.‚Äù**

**‚ÄùDEAR GOD NO.‚Äù**

*In a state of pure panic, Griffo quickly deletes his Instagram account in the hopes that his name will disappear. Unfortunately, after doing a quick Google search, Griffo realises that deleting her account was the worst possible thing he could have done as not only can his ex-manger still see her name, but now he is  completely locked out for three hours and this has already been noticed by all 15.2 million of his followers.*

**‚ÄùI swear I was being so careful‚Äù, *mutters Griffo.*

**‚ÄùI even made sure to scroll on the right-hand side so I wouldn‚Äôt accidentally like anything.‚Äù**

**‚ÄùHonestly what‚Äôs the fucking point of looking at your ex-campaign manager. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre going to post anything where they look bloody miserable!‚Äù**
