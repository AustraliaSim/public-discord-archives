The Youmaton Government has been re-elected, with the Social Democrats etching close to holding a majority in their own right.


[17-Mar-19 06:47 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
The Liberals have been decimated, with their leader Porridge holding into the blue ribbon seat of Moncrieff. Former Prime Minister PineappleCrusher_ lost his battle in Parramatta, which is a blow to the future prospects of the Liberals.


[17-Mar-19 06:51 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Australians are now questioning what lies ahead for the Liberals, and indeed, for their leader.


[17-Mar-19 06:53 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
The Australian Conservatives and United Australia Party also had a lackluster night, with a split right providing dividends to the Social Democrats to make gains in Perth and Cowper.


[17-Mar-19 06:55 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
SHOCKINGLY, the Government performed bad in the Senate ballot - with one quota awarded to the Social Democrats. The Liberals, United Democrats and United Australia Parties each won a seat which could provide a hurdle for Youmaton as the government's agenda advances.
