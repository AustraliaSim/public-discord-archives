In todays news the Great Australian Bight Protection Bill has passed through parliament


[02-Apr-19 08:21 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
Vocal opponents of the bill include TheGreatSenator who believes that the bill will cause the destruction of the money coming from the Bass Strait to the Tasmanian state economy.


[02-Apr-19 08:23 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
While those supporting the bill believe that the bill will make the wildlife of the Bight safe from mass destruction from an oil spill due to offshore drillings.

I quote Senator TheGreatSenator for Tasmania.


[02-Apr-19 08:24 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
"Tasmania has the right to make an income from the Bass Strait."


[02-Apr-19 08:24 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
"Yeah, all 8 oil spills in Australias history, none occurring in the Great Australian Bight. Our state is going to lose from this  passing if anything!
Oh and some of those werent even offshore drilling, they were tankers!"


[02-Apr-19 08:24 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
[sourced from his Twitter account]


[02-Apr-19 08:25 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
The bill however is meant to protect the Bight from future threats of wildlife contamination and annihilation, not from past threats.

Str. imnofox said that he did not scrutinise the bill but rather the Govt. plans to protect jobs and workers in the oil rigs from losing their jobs completely.

I do note that Str. imnofox was elected a Socialist senator but then went through different parties as safehavens from plain party and factional politics.


[02-Apr-19 08:32 PM] imnofox#2340
Planet over party!!


[02-Apr-19 08:32 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
He ended up in the Centre Alliance but then declared his alleigiance to the planet over plain politicking and thus formed the Green Party along with me and FinePorpoise.

Shocking claims from the Liberal Democrats!


[07-May-19 09:36 PM] imnofox#2340
LDP leader **nazi**porridge has claimed that the State of Queensland is not actually a state!


[07-May-19 09:37 PM] imnofox#2340
Instead, he has accused the State of Queensland of *actually* being a satirical PDF published by a former Green candidate.


[07-May-19 09:38 PM] imnofox#2340
Queenslanders will wake up tomorrow in shock to find the Leader of the Opposition de-statemising Queensland by declaring it a PDF document.


[07-May-19 09:38 PM] imnofox#2340
Greens co-leader and MP for Lingiari imnofox has shot back at the LOTO, re-affirming that Queensland is *not* a PDF document, but a beautiful region of Australia.


[07-May-19 09:39 PM] imnofox#2340
TheMontyJohnson, Senator for PDF, is yet to comment on his party's new position on Queensland.
