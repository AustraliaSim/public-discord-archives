The former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has called on Lingiari MP to withdraw supply from coalition government over the decision not to include Indigenous Affairs in the cabinet portfolio.

Dyljam, who is the Member for Dennison, previously led the ministry in the Bloodychrome government has asked Lingiari MP to respond. 

The opposition MP says the move to merge the ministry into Equality Minister is a step backwards for aboriginal affairs.

But the Prime Minister, Youmaton, has defended the cabinet choice, saying the reshuffle still covers aboriginal affairs.  

`There is a Minister responsible for Indigenous Affairs, and they have more than a billion extra dollars in funding compared to the BloodyChrome government that they can use to achieve better outcome  for the Indigenous community`

The first bill of the government and the first bill of 2019 has been introduced to the Upper House today in the Fracking Ban Bill.

The bill, submitted by Senator Lieselta, aims to ban hydraulic fracking in Australiasim, and will buy back licenses issued to companies already authorised for fracking.

Senator Liesel says in parliament that the bill is an important environmental move.

`There are several environment risks stemming from the practice of fracking, including but not limited to more pollution in both the ground and air, and disruption to wildlife in the area that fracking is taking place`

Mr PineappleCrusher you've hit the ground running, and it's a bit of a controversial idea historically. We're seeing legislation that will allow nuclear power in Australiasim.


[01-Jan-19 09:17 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Do you think now is the right time for us to go nuclear?


[01-Jan-19 09:19 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
It's about time we do flick the switch to nuclear, and its a shame we didn't after the Switkowski report that said this source of power would be competitive if Australia went under the sanction of carbon credits.


[01-Jan-19 09:19 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
It's cleaner than coal, and more reliable than wind and sun. It's a win win and will keep costs down.

Okay, so I wont get you to go into the details here tonight, people ca read the bill itself on /r/AustraliasimLower. But can you tell us do you expect this bill to gain much support, particuarly from the government?


[01-Jan-19 09:22 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
I'm not sure if the government would support it, but I'm hearing some rumbles of support from our side and other parts of the House of Representatives since I moved to introduce the bill a few hours ago.


[01-Jan-19 09:24 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
I challenge the government to this, if we want to combat emissions, this is how we can do it without driving power prices through the roof. The Cleaner Australian Power Bill will allow us to construct and build power sources emitting 910g less per kilowatt than coal, and will give the wallets of Australians deep health!


[01-Jan-19 09:25 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Okay. The typical criticisms of this type of power are a) safety handling and accidents, and b) responsible and economical disposal. How can you assure people that by going agead with this, we wont end up with any catastophic accidents or poor nuclear waste disposal problems?


[01-Jan-19 09:28 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
What the Cleaner Australian Power Bill does is give the Minister for Environment more wiggle room when it comes to allowing the construction and operation of nuclear power in the Commonwealth of Australia, which, if the Minister is a good governor and politician, would render the concerns mentioned as null as the government would put immense consideration into detail before approval and would develop first class protocols as we would expect in our nation for waste disposal and accident response.

This proves that the government isn‚Äôt serious about reducing emissions. It‚Äôs either that Youmaton and his cronies want to increase the burden on Australians with expensive and unreliable power sources or that the talk is talked, but the walk never happens. Emissions reduction is a sensitive topic in Australia, and we could have achieved bipartisan support with something that would have reduced emissions at a rather significant rate.

Many Australians have already heard the discussions surround MHR, and yet the opt-out date has been pushed back further and further. It seems people still don't quite know what's going on, so if you don't mind Sudo, could you explain to us the basic premise of MHR, and what about it is so daunting or confusing for people?


[01-Jan-19 09:42 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Sure thing. My Health Record is an online system for collating basic health information. Currently, GPs, specialists and hospital systems in Australia use different and separate electronic systems to store healthcare information, so if you are admitted to hospital, for example, the doctors at the hospital do not automatically have access to information about your health from your GP's systems. This might include information about current medications, allergies, and current/past health. My Health Record has been developed to allow GPs to upload these kinds of information, as well as test results and other documents, so they can be accessed wherever necessary.


[01-Jan-19 09:43 PM] RunasSudo#2416
From 31 January 2019, a My Health Record will be automatically created for all Australians, unless you decide to "opt out" of the system. This has created a lot of consternation, because some people have argued that the My Health Record would make it easier for privacy to be breached, for example through hacking, unauthorised access, or access by law enforcement.


[01-Jan-19 09:45 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Do you think privacy breach is the biggest concern people have, and is the concern backed by any real possibility of it being realised?


[01-Jan-19 09:49 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Privacy seems to be the main issue at play here, and given how sensitive health information can be, it's understandable why. In terms of privacy, there are 2 main factors: first is unauthorised access, like hacking; and second is access by law enforcement and other agencies.

In terms of unauthorised access, the legislation contains penalties for unauthorised access, and the Australian Digital Health Agency, which adminsters the My Health Record, says that the platform is well-secured. On the other hand, defending against hacking is always a difficult task, and government technology projects haven't always had the best track record when it comes to being built well, like the kerfuffle with the last census being online.

In terms of access to information, the whole point of My Health Record is to allow easier access by people who need it. There's been some concern, though, about areas like access by police without a court order. The Australian Digital Health Agency says that it will not share any information without a court order, but the legislation is more permissive and could permit information to be shared without a court order, so the jury is out on that one.


[01-Jan-19 09:51 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Mr Sudo can you tell us what problems or limtations a person may face if they do opt-out? I'm guessing things will stay the same as the do now and have been for some time, and they wont gain the benefits of MHR. Is this correct, or are there going to be other issues people may face?

[01-Jan-19 09:55 PM] RunasSudo#2416
That's essentially correct, if you opt out of the My Health Record system, things will continue the same as they have up until now. If you're admitted to hospital, the doctors there won't have automatic access to information that might have otherwise been uploaded, like health summary, medications, allergies and so on. Instead they would have to manually contact your GP for details. It's been reported that lack of access to this information has led to some patients, for example, being given medicines that they were allergic to.

If you do choose to opt out, and you change your mind later, you can still register for the My Health Record at a later time, and similarly if you don't opt out, you can also choose to delete your My Health Record later.

The Prime Minister has confirmed that the Government will not be supporting the Nuclear bill.

The Youmaton cabinet has this evening voted on the bill, introduced by the Member for Pearce, Pineapple Crusher.

The bill would see nuclear power generation in Australiasim, but concerns have been raised about the specifics of the legislation, which has attracted criticism from government members.

`Nuclear power made sense if we built it 60 years ago. The strides made in renewable energy have now rendered nuclear power obsolete, and PineappleCrusher's Bill is just another case of the Liberal Party trying to legislate for the Australia we had in the 1950s, and not the one we have today`

Meanwhile,

The Government has confirmed that it will be re-introducing the live export bill from last term as the legislative agenda becomes clearer.

The bill was laid aside at the end of parliament, failing to pass both houses in time. The bill is likely to pass in the current house, and will ban the live exporting of livestock from Australiasim.

This evening the movement that was Liberty Reform Party has imploded in spectacular fashion, with Liberal FEC members TheAudibleAsh, Dicky_Knee and apparently Porridge "joining" the Liberty Reform Party while still remaining members of the Liberal Party.

I am utterly disgusted by the actions of certain members of the Liberal FEC, they attempted to remove opposition to their own agendas by launching a hostile invasion of the Liberty Reform Party. The invasion was quickly rejected. Libery Reform has revoked all agreements with them. The Liberal Party has once again proved that they are more facist and authoritarian than Hitler and Stalin themselves.

**SDP candidate promises rail upgrade to Mount Barker**


[10-Mar-19 11:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Today on the campaign trail the SDP candidate SpyroSpeedruns promised an electric Adelaide Metro rail service between Adelaide and Mount Barker. He has stated that this line would likely run along the current Overland tracks, linking up to the Belair line.


[10-Mar-19 11:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
This would require the electrification of the Belair train line through the steep foothills, and then a rail link through the steep Adelaide Hills.


[10-Mar-19 11:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
It would also require a new order of A-City 4000 class electric railcars, and perhaps prevent the use of 3000 class railcars due to the steep descent/ascent on the line.

So anyway haha I'm here to uh talk about Canberra transport infrastructure


[02-Apr-19 08:29 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Basically you go to Melbourne and like... Trams everywhere!


[02-Apr-19 08:30 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Whereas Canberra, which they built up from nothing, doesn't have any trams!


[02-Apr-19 08:30 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Why is that the case???


[02-Apr-19 08:31 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
How can you build a city from scratch and not plan this sort of thing you know?


[02-Apr-19 08:31 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

Apologies. Thank you Alice for having me


[02-Apr-19 08:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
can I just say a huge congratulations to the Adelaide Crows for winning their second AFLW premiership on Sunday.


[02-Apr-19 08:38 PM] Matt Monti#4771
To be in the crowd that day was amazing. To witness a historic crowd of 53,034 people fill the Adelaide Oval was something that brought a tear my eye.

[02-Apr-19 08:39 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Everyone knew it was a special day when the crowd grew so big the oval administration were forced to open the Eastern Grandstand and eventually the Riverbank Stand.


[02-Apr-19 08:39 PM] Matt Monti#4771

What did we all think of the AFLW Grand Final?


[02-Apr-19 08:41 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
not sure, afl isnt my sport


[02-Apr-19 08:43 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Fair. Well, I must say that 53,000+ people showing up for that match should put any debate about the validity of the AFLW to bed.


[02-Apr-19 08:43 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Hey Manly


[02-Apr-19 08:43 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You're epic!


[02-Apr-19 08:43 PM] ManlyKitten#6380

[02-Apr-19 08:43 PM] ManlyKitten#6380

[02-Apr-19 08:43 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
you are quite epic as well


[02-Apr-19 08:44 PM] Matt Monti#4771
...right


[02-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Matt Monti#4771
well, any other SA news?


[02-Apr-19 08:45 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
well Queensland has been officially declared as epic


[02-Apr-19 08:45 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
probably the most epic state


[02-Apr-19 08:45 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
of them all


[02-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Matt Monti#4771
sure


[02-Apr-19 08:45 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
just my very humble and modest opinion


[02-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
well as a state without a Lib Dem representative, I think South Australia is more Epic than Queensland


[02-Apr-19 08:46 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
hilarious


[02-Apr-19 08:46 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
anywho


[02-Apr-19 08:46 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
we must deregulate the economy


[02-Apr-19 08:47 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
we MUST protect land rights for property owners


[02-Apr-19 08:47 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
we MUST protect the people from tyrrany


[02-Apr-19 08:47 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I think Victoria is more epic


[02-Apr-19 08:47 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Ok this is not a campaigning opportunity


[02-Apr-19 08:47 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
epic
