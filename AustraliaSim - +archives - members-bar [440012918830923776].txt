"Hi guys, if you've just joined us, we're here this evening for a unique charity event being held by The ACTion Men, until today know to most in New Zealand as the ACT Party candidates. There have been several dance performances by various local dance groups but now it's time for the main event! The ACTion men will be performing a striptease, I've been told that there will no full monty at this stage so tough luck ladies!"

The music changes and tempo increases, the sold out stadium goes wild as the ACTion men make their way to the stage. Laughing and waving at the crowd

"Wow here they come and don't they look confident! I've heard they have been rehearsing this for the past few months let's see how they perform."

The ACTion Men have lined up on stage and as the music starts they begin to perform their routine, well timed and perfectly in sync with each other and the music. As they work done through their clothes the cheers from the crowd get louder and louder

"Wow, I'm blown away! Who would've thought politicians could be so suave and seductive, I'll tell you now ACT certainly aren't like other political parties and they definitely have my vote. The stadium is packed and I'm just getting a report now that at $5 per ticket ACT have raised $65,000 for local charities. Can you believe it."

As the ACTion Men finish their routine wearing nothing but barely there edible g-strings the crowd explodes in cheers and they cheekily tease the audience

"Well that's all from us tonight, I think if ACT lose this election they at least they have a fall back career to work on. The ladies in the crowd look ravenous I'm not sure they will even make it out alive"

@NotGriffonomics because it should not be forced on people to spend the money to use these sessions moreso it should remain a choice of people to use counselling, forcing people to do counselling has the ability to raise costs. I can support 1 as it can help them decide but at some point it becomes unnecessary, especially if the parties have already decided

This is a very quick statement.

I thank the Parliament for confirming my appointment and for the Prime Minister for recommending my appointment. I look forward to working with my fellow Justices, other Parliamentary Moderators, and citizens.

I will be learning the ropes over the next week or two, but I will not hesitate, where necessary, to use judicial discretion as per the Code of Conduct Act 2017.

I still plan to be active on other matters, such as news articles, response to Bills, and the like. I believe in an active and vibrant community. I will be planning to recuse myself from all cases going on that deal with Acts that are written by me and passed from today onwards to prevent conflict of interest. Otherwise, I will be actively participating on all future cases before the Court.

I thank the people of Australia for granting me this opportunity.

General Rommel.

The VAD bill last year did legalise VAD across Australia, however if a government were to repeal that in the future, the ACT and NT would not be able to legislate about it in their own manner like the states can.

"Making it a state is a conflict of interest"


[30-Apr-18 07:08 PM] Youmaton#1190
It is well within the constitution for the creation of new states


[30-Apr-18 07:14 PM] Youmaton#1190
That section of the constitution can be adjusted, to allow for ACT Statehood


[30-Apr-18 07:15 PM] Youmaton#1190
There it is, Chapter 6


[30-Apr-18 07:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
They created territories because they were low population areas, and so they could be administered by the federal parliament. Then came along the self-governance acts. ACT is a special case due to the original Federation convention making it a territory to appease Victoria and NSW, however there's nothing changing the constitution to confirm Canberra as the capital and allow the ACT to be a state.

I think the parliamentary area should be something like DC where the main part of canberra with the high court, fed lib, parliament houses should be a territory


[30-Apr-18 07:20 PM] Rat#1042
So long as it doesn't include where people live


[30-Apr-18 07:21 PM] Rat#1042
but not the entire ACT, that should be a state


[30-Apr-18 07:21 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
The capital of Australia should not be in a state. I do support the Northern Territory being granted statehood, but not the ACT


[30-Apr-18 07:22 PM] Youmaton#1190
The parliamentary triangle isn't directly controlled by the ACT Government anyway. There's a seperate authority that controls that area to keep it seperate from certain things within the ACT.


[30-Apr-18 07:23 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Rhode Island is a tiny state compared to Texas but is still a state. Population and geographical size are not overly relevant arguments for statehood. Tasmania is a tiny area compared to Western Australia. Does that mean we remove statehood from Tasmania?

The LGBT Minister is a necessary position at this point in time. We need a Minister that can focus on issues important to the LGBT community. In a time when the community aren't equal to our hetero-normative counterparts. If we were equal and all past governments and ministers supported the LGBT community, then ministry would have been established. Now @LuSing My Religion has been appointed to look our for the community and focus on issues that affect us. I for one am very proud to be part a Socialist/Labor/Pirates Government that supports the LGBT community!

You know, we aren't equal at the moment, the "special help and aid" you talk about is needed to help make us equal to the majority. When a Minority isn't equal with the majority in a Democratic society, they need help. We can't make ourselves equal. If we could, we would have done it already.

Why is there a Minister devoted to LGBT people -- what about other minority communities?

@Viado Celtru I believe that you may misunderstand the meaning of what this bill will do. It is purely to restore the rights of the territories to debate and legislate on this topic as the states are able to.


[01-May-18 10:04 AM] Youmaton#1190
Im open to talk to you about the bill if you wish :)


[01-May-18 10:08 AM] Youmaton#1190
Additionally on this point, this will not happen. The point of VAD is to give an option to those who are terminally-ill to end the pain, not to end the life of those with physiartic illnesses

[14-May-18 11:37 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Good Morning. 
I speak today in regards to a motion now before the House of Representatives made by the member for Fairfax, @NotGriffonomics . The motion relates to accusations of inactivity by myself in all areas on of the House. I wish to clarify a few things for the benefit of the Australian public, the House and the Member for Fairfax. I can confidently say I have not be completely inactive since being sworn in as the Member for Denison. However, I do admit being inactive and absent from the House for an extended period. This is due to deeply personal reasons that I would rather not share publically. Although if the information is deemed relevant and necessary for the High Court, should the house refer me, I will oblige. I have profound respect for the member for Fairfax and completely understand why he has put forward this motion. I will respect the decision of the House no matter the outcome. 
Thank you all for your time.


[14-May-18 03:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Matt in my mind deserves a warning, he's tried voting since the motion, so it's not as if the absence will continue, and it was an honest mistake to not apply for leave.


[14-May-18 03:17 PM] Rat#1042
He did vote late on 2 bills


[14-May-18 03:18 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
To be fair to Matt though when he made the vote on the bill which closed at 11 it was 10:45 where he's at


[14-May-18 03:19 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So it's still voting late but it's an easy mistake to make


[14-May-18 03:20 PM] Rat#1042
Fair point, however everything is in Canberra time


[14-May-18 03:20 PM] Rat#1042

That isnt happening, the convention voted for a republic. I understand you dont agree with the republic, but saying nothing but literally "shame" the entire time does not help progress the country.

[22-May-18 09:21 PM] _slothsworth#4496
I feel bad, but rules are rules.

Twitter-Muted has been fixed -- you can see, however, not speak.


[22-May-18 09:24 PM] _slothsworth#4496
Furthermore, the High Court of Australia have released summary sentences for @Deleted User and @High Priest Liam.


[22-May-18 09:47 PM] Youmaton#1190
@_slothsworth Just wished to know a bit more about the rulings re. slothsworth v Mad_Bear_o_Melbourne and slothsworth v woof332. Given the circumstances of the second defendant's (woof332) aggressive nature within his comments, and Liam's retaliation being on the basis of defense. I fully understand the courts right to rule as it sees fit under s 62, however I curious how two defensive comments from Liam get two days whilst more comments from woof332 get 3 days. I fully respect the court's decision, and just wished to understand the ruling more.


[22-May-18 09:48 PM] Ash#8178
I agree with Youma


[22-May-18 09:49 PM] Youmaton#1190
I understand that, however Im wondering why the sentence was so severe in comparison


[22-May-18 09:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
I agree there should be a punishment for said actions, dont get me wrong.


[22-May-18 09:50 PM] _slothsworth#4496
Given this being a summary sentence, the maximum sentence to be served lawfully would be 3 days. Given the nature of woof332 and the three comments he made, he was sentenced to serve this maximum time.


[22-May-18 09:50 PM] _slothsworth#4496
On the other hand, while defensively, Liam still made those two comments.


[22-May-18 09:50 PM] _slothsworth#4496
In doing so, he did violate the code of conduct.


[22-May-18 09:51 PM] Youmaton#1190
And i accept so.


[22-May-18 09:51 PM] _slothsworth#4496
The choice to sentence Liam to 2 days of mute was done as a 1 day mute is unlikely to discourage such behaviour, and is a weak sentence for violating the code of conduct.


[22-May-18 09:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
Given the circumstances, I would have expected a mute of a day or a day and a half. However, I see where you are coming from


[22-May-18 09:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
Ah


[22-May-18 09:52 PM] _slothsworth#4496
Hopefully this helps clear up the distinction between the time of each sentence.

ANZUS is great and all, but have you ever heard of DIPLOMACY~


[29-May-18 08:54 PM] delad#7470
yeah Australia doesn't have the military or economic ability to be a great power


[29-May-18 08:54 PM] RunasSudo#2416
This is great
> ANZUS
But I like this
> DIPLOMACY


[29-May-18 08:54 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
it could if we wanted to


[29-May-18 08:54 PM] delad#7470
it's a debate whether or not France is one (I think they are btw)

[29-May-18 08:55 PM] Youmaton#1190
It isnt expanding, its bringing the NZ back into ANZUS


[29-May-18 08:55 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
we need population expansion


[29-May-18 08:55 PM] delad#7470

[29-May-18 08:55 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but it could be done


[29-May-18 08:55 PM] Youmaton#1190
We need to better our infrastructure in order to boost our population

Italy has a much bigger economy, stronger military, more diplomatic influence and isn't a great power

[29-May-18 08:57 PM] delad#7470
it's purely unrealistic for australia to become a great power


[29-May-18 08:57 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[29-May-18 08:57 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

Us being a middle power is already ridiculous


[29-May-18 08:58 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The entire city of new york is roughly our population


[29-May-18 08:58 PM] delad#7470

[03-Jun-18 07:32 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
It's not the use of "you're"
It's the attack on unions that is the part that targets millions
Do you not get that?
Unless you specify a union, saying Unions generally does actually mean you're going after more than one union


[03-Jun-18 07:32 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[03-Jun-18 12:32 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the snideness which I'm getting from that is unnecessary
1. I was under the impression you were showing it before you shared it with everybody else
2.If you feel its clearly directed to one person and not at all a blanket attack then do what you will
I simply supplemented DKR's criticism 
Not an attack on you or your character, if you thought it was then my apologies

On memes - perhaps a competition for memes would be better, with a small vote modifier as bonus for the winner, during a campaign. All in one place, otherwise they don‚Äôt accrue modifiers

shall be treated as the bed of her impurity; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her impurity. <27> Whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until the evening.

And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall be his slave forever."

[11-Jun-18 12:34 PM] _slothsworth#4496
I know people who've gone from the top of the class to being lazy and unconcerned through weed use


[11-Jun-18 12:34 PM] Shrub#2503
True


[11-Jun-18 12:34 PM] _slothsworth#4496
You would know


[11-Jun-18 12:34 PM] Shrub#2503
Yes i would


[11-Jun-18 12:34 PM] _slothsworth#4496
I see it as a personal freedom


[11-Jun-18 12:34 PM] Rat#1042
(I don't think recreational weed should be legal. But medicinal should.)


[11-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Shrub#2503
But it may have even been better for them if it was legal


[11-Jun-18 12:35 PM] _slothsworth#4496
not something i would do, want me or my friends to do


[11-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Rat#1042
(Oh wait this is canon)


[11-Jun-18 12:35 PM] _slothsworth#4496
but something that should be allowed


[11-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Ash#8178
But make it 18+


[11-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Ash#8178
Legalise that shit


[11-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Shrub#2503
Arguably, legalising it would make it harder for minors to access


[11-Jun-18 12:36 PM] Shrub#2503
And less dangerous because we can actually regulate it


[11-Jun-18 12:36 PM] _slothsworth#4496
I think legality is important.


[11-Jun-18 12:36 PM] _slothsworth#4496
I'd like smoking cigarettes and vaping to be completely illegal in public places


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
nah


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
im fine with it


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] Shrub#2503
I agree, its a danger to public health


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
one could persuade me on smoking


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but not vaping


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
vaping isnt on the same level


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] Shrub#2503
Maybe not vaping


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] _slothsworth#4496
yes i would concede on vaping


[11-Jun-18 12:37 PM] _slothsworth#4496
but smoking no


[11-Jun-18 12:38 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
my rule of thumb is


[11-Jun-18 12:38 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
my liberties can only justifiably be infringed upon if they are a danger to someone else's liberties


[11-Jun-18 12:38 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so


[11-Jun-18 12:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if im smoking


[11-Jun-18 12:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so long as i harm no one


[11-Jun-18 12:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
there shouldnt be an issue


[11-Jun-18 12:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if i am, there is


[11-Jun-18 12:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so in this case, it depends on the place


[11-Jun-18 12:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
some areas one could just avoid it


[11-Jun-18 12:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but others they have no choice


[11-Jun-18 12:40 PM] _slothsworth#4496
sure, i agree smoking places are fine


[11-Jun-18 12:40 PM] _slothsworth#4496
but otherwise, smoking on the street, on the road


[11-Jun-18 12:40 PM] Shrub#2503
But I believe it should not be the responsibility of others to avoid it if it is a public place


[11-Jun-18 12:40 PM] _slothsworth#4496
yes, exactl


[11-Jun-18 12:40 PM] _slothsworth#4496
exactly


[11-Jun-18 12:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
well
I sort of do if there are places to go


[11-Jun-18 12:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
from a utilitarian perspective


[11-Jun-18 12:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if i want to smoke and you want to walk


[11-Jun-18 12:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the best course of action would be for me to smoke, and you to walk away from me


[11-Jun-18 12:41 PM] _slothsworth#4496
no it would not


[11-Jun-18 12:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
that would maximise happiness


[11-Jun-18 12:41 PM] _slothsworth#4496
i have to smoke in your carcinogens then


[11-Jun-18 12:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
because everybody would get to do what they want


[11-Jun-18 12:41 PM] _slothsworth#4496
and i do not want to do that at all


[11-Jun-18 12:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so you walk away


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so that you arent affected


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] _slothsworth#4496
and still breathe it in/


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] _slothsworth#4496
I will breathe it in for a period of time


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
thats why you should be away from me


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
when i say walk away


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
i dont mean start next to me and move


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
i mean walk


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] _slothsworth#4496
i say don't smoke in public places


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but not in my vicinity


[11-Jun-18 12:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
i say, depends on the place


[11-Jun-18 12:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
some places you can walk without being affected by i


[11-Jun-18 12:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
other places, you cant


[11-Jun-18 12:43 PM] Shrub#2503
yes but you can't regulate who is standing where and in which cases its obstructive or not, that is very subjective and can differ by time of day


[11-Jun-18 12:44 PM] _slothsworth#4496
frankly


[11-Jun-18 12:44 PM] _slothsworth#4496
smoking releases its dangerous substances


[11-Jun-18 12:44 PM] _slothsworth#4496
and that passive smoking will still happen, even if i walk away within seconds


[11-Jun-18 12:44 PM] _slothsworth#4496
the question is


[11-Jun-18 12:45 PM] _slothsworth#4496
do i have to suffer those substances, despite me being in a public place and consciously not taking the effort to smoke


[11-Jun-18 12:45 PM] _slothsworth#4496
to me, the answer is no


[11-Jun-18 06:35 PM] Deleted User#0000

However, it was tabled in December 2017. 1 - this sucks because it‚Äôs a rich resource of submissions on the subject - and 2, can I use the submissions?

I thank you for your open letter. I agree with many of the issues you have raised within the bill. I will be working with my party, and any other parliamentarians who wish to assist on this matter, to make sure that essential items are tax free. Over a long term period, I hope to create a system in which sanitary products (in relation to menstruation) are free. @_slothsworth


[08-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Youmaton#1190
The door to my office is always open, I look forward to talking to you more about this


[08-Jul-18 09:42 PM] _slothsworth#4496
I appreciate the co-operation that @Youmaton is extending. An honourable cause to be woking on, hopefully all of Australia can chip in and create these systems together.


[08-Jul-18 09:49 PM] delad#7470
As a very long term campaigner for tax reform i belive a far better solution is to have no sanitary items be free from GST.

I am in favour of axing tax of course


[09-Jul-18 08:54 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Just as a point of discussion, though


[09-Jul-18 08:55 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Why axe tampon tax specifically?


[09-Jul-18 08:57 AM] Youmaton#1190
After talks with people, I do think that essential items shouldn't be taxed, but things like Viagra still definitely should be taxed


[09-Jul-18 08:59 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
There we go, just what I was hoping for: ‚Äúessential‚Äù

Alright now, singling our tampons implies that tampons are amongst the most essential items for human life.


[09-Jul-18 09:01 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
But surely if it was about ‚Äúessentials‚Äù you would be targeting food, water, shelter AND, most importantly, income üòâ


[09-Jul-18 09:02 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
So, it seems you chose tampons for political convenience


[09-Jul-18 09:02 AM] Youmaton#1190
We aren't abolishing income tax


[09-Jul-18 09:02 AM] BellmanTGM#3331

[09-Jul-18 09:02 AM] Youmaton#1190
This directly relates to the gst

you've literally just assumed she will


[09-Jul-18 09:04 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I would if I were Youma


[09-Jul-18 09:04 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
üòõ


[09-Jul-18 09:04 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I‚Äôm not saying I have a problem. I‚Äôm just saying, that it is not because tampons are ‚Äúessential‚Äù


[09-Jul-18 09:05 AM] Youmaton#1190
Why would I do that? I want honest and proper debate on this bill.


[09-Jul-18 09:05 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so you're having a go because you assume she is going to do something, even though she hasnt yet, and then when pressed on that you only assume it because its what you would do


[09-Jul-18 09:05 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
If it was about essentials for human life we wouldn't be targeting income tax, but the much larger amount of money taken as surplus labour value ***t b h***


[09-Jul-18 09:05 AM] Youmaton#1190
>implying tampons aren't essential


[09-Jul-18 09:05 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I mean they aren‚Äôt.


[09-Jul-18 09:05 AM] Youmaton#1190
They are.


[09-Jul-18 09:06 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
But neither are condoms. They get tax free.


[09-Jul-18 09:06 AM] Youmaton#1190

[09-Jul-18 09:06 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
they do?


[09-Jul-18 09:06 AM] Youmaton#1190
There's a massive difference between condoms and tampons


[09-Jul-18 09:06 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I know.


[09-Jul-18 09:06 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I‚Äôm on your side


[09-Jul-18 09:06 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
really?
Cause ash was going all YOU SHOULDNT TAX CONDOMS AS WELL


[09-Jul-18 09:06 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
‚ÄúEssential‚Äù doesn‚Äôt come into it


[09-Jul-18 09:07 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
no youma he's saying that they're different and that tampons shouldnt be taxed because condoms arent


[09-Jul-18 09:07 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
^


[09-Jul-18 09:07 AM] Youmaton#1190
Ah


[09-Jul-18 09:07 AM] Youmaton#1190
My bad


[09-Jul-18 09:07 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
which ironically was what Ash said
Ash was like if you dont tax tampons you cant tax condoms


[09-Jul-18 09:07 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway I wouldn‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt buy tampons or condones


[09-Jul-18 09:07 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Condoms*


[09-Jul-18 09:07 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well yes but taxing condoms is a stupid idea from a public health perspective


[09-Jul-18 09:08 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Tax is a stupid idea in general tbh


[09-Jul-18 09:08 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Just like taxing tampons *t b h*


[09-Jul-18 09:08 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
GST is


[09-Jul-18 09:08 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
GST is better than income tax


[09-Jul-18 09:08 AM] Youmaton#1190
The GST is good when it's taxing the right things

If @Youmaton is actually committed to removing taxes on essentials, I expect a bill to remove GST application to food products and services next.


[09-Jul-18 09:09 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
basic foods maybe


[09-Jul-18 09:09 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Sure


[09-Jul-18 09:09 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like you still tax chocolate mousse and shit


[09-Jul-18 09:09 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but things like bread


[09-Jul-18 09:10 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
or healthy foods


[09-Jul-18 09:10 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
But just give me this talk about ‚Äúessentials‚Äù when you are neglecting basic essentials for hygiene essentials.


[09-Jul-18 09:10 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
remove gst on healthy foods, make them slightly more affordable


[09-Jul-18 09:11 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Incentivising Healthy Foods Bill (2018) let‚Äôs do it

I call on the Opposition Leader to put their money where their mouth is here.


[09-Jul-18 09:13 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
its a good idea, especially considering its cheaper to buy crap than it is to buy good, nutritional stuff


[09-Jul-18 09:23 AM] Youmaton#1190
I agree that it's a good idea, I hope that the Senator will continue giving input into the creation of such a bill


[09-Jul-18 04:16 PM] delad#7470
that already exists you too


[09-Jul-18 04:16 PM] delad#7470

I, /u/Kaarrien , are actually supporting these moves! Maybe if they would like to understand basic physical science, not just fluctuates depending on this debate, it's not give the bill.

Citing several health concerns, which are on any future legislation, which need to myself, with him, where I was elected on, and safeguarded the change just because some of affairs, not personally married, so many discussions with the Great Artesian fluoridation until such charged emotion from dissection by the government, because an equal amount, without a man walking along the obligation to both his bills are significant political upheaval, the law from any threat must be dealt with deep feelings about the last 50 years, the law from any criticism, or sold a measure, that has continued on an equal amounts of marriage, which are happiest about the long term in Macquarie for a routine change to fit a top class speaker,

I cannot confirm that matter how the individuals involved are far wider, some of NSW citizens who is the safe number, leads to an area being applied to serve as short term interests of any reference i've made;

Picture the member for Melbourne privately, or modified to provide any member seeing it has strong border protections for your service, as trendy. Marriage between peoples, and must be able to this evening to enjoy the Minister will lay out of a widespread problem, but such changes for incoming people who despite centuries of the Health Minister will also be compared to the perpetuation of working class speaker,```

The Australian Greens (commonly known as The Greens) is a green political party in Australia.

The party was formed in 1992 and is a confederation of eight state and territorial parties. In addition to environmentalism, the party cites four core values: ecological sustainability, social justice, grassroots democracy and peace and non-violence.[3]

Party constituencies can be traced to various origins ‚Äì notably the early environmental movement in Australia and the formation of the United Tasmania Group (UTG), one of the first green parties in the world,[4] but also the nuclear disarmament movement in Western Australia and sections of the industrial left in New South Wales. Co-ordination between environmentalist groups occurred in the 1980s with various significant protests. Key people involved in these campaigns included Bob Brown and Christine Milne who went on to contest and win seats in the Tasmanian Parliament and eventually form the Tasmanian Greens; both Brown and Milne subsequently became leaders of the federal party.

@PineappleCrusher_ I wished to talk to you regarding the Social Services (NO JAB, NO PAY)
Legislation Amendment Bill 2018. It has my full support, however I wanted to check two things:

a) What provisions are in place for those children who are actually allergic to any particular vaccination (there are cases of this from what i can remember)

b) Will ALL vaccinations be classified as free, so that we do not run into a situation where someone cant get paid due to not having enough money to afford the vaccination


[02-Aug-18 01:39 PM] Rat#1042
I dont think it was repealed because the bill repealed the amendment and not the actual bill


[02-Aug-18 01:39 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
It‚Äôs listed as an Act in the master spreadsheet, it received Royal assent. The quibble seems to be over what the bill actually did.

[02-Aug-18 01:47 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
Anyway, here‚Äôs Rommel‚Äôs take on how the bill would actually work back in the day:

‚ÄúIt certainly does seem that the long title does need to be amended. In relation to s 7,better to say that the Bill before the House may not simply repeal an amendment already made, it must note the actual Acts to repeal, that is, the ''A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999'.‚Äù

[02-Aug-18 01:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Because I'm confused right now


[02-Aug-18 01:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I spent two hours in equity and my head is floating


[02-Aug-18 01:49 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
Did the Kaarrien act back in 2017 actually do anything


[02-Aug-18 01:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
The Australian Medical Safety Act?

[02-Aug-18 01:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
yep it did nothing


[02-Aug-18 01:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190
The Act is utterly meaningless


[02-Aug-18 01:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190
What is this?


[02-Aug-18 01:51 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
What about your Clerk comment back in the day which said that if the originating act was explicitly stated as being amended by repealing the amendment act, it would change the originating act


[02-Aug-18 01:51 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
Which I copy pasted a few moments ago

[02-Aug-18 01:53 PM] General_Rommel#0190
you saying


[02-Aug-18 01:53 PM] General_Rommel#0190
since the amendment was never repealed properly


[02-Aug-18 01:53 PM] General_Rommel#0190
why is the Parliament trying to amend it when it already is the case?


[02-Aug-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's what I asked


[02-Aug-18 01:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Okay now I get it.


[02-Aug-18 01:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Well


[02-Aug-18 01:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
For starters


[02-Aug-18 01:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
this government is incompetent and/or the AG is sleeping


[02-Aug-18 01:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Second the government should either vote to withdraw the matter from parliament


[02-Aug-18 01:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
or get everyone to abstain/vote no to its continuation


[02-Aug-18 01:55 PM] General_Rommel#0190
if its in the senate


[02-Aug-18 01:55 PM] General_Rommel#0190
then the senate should deal with it that way.


[02-Aug-18 01:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well they could just vote to repeal an act that didn't work


[02-Aug-18 01:56 PM] Youmaton#1190
That could be done


[02-Aug-18 01:56 PM] General_Rommel#0190
you can do that too

The entire purpose of the term will be to build the range.

To be fair, if we get the ball rolling and form a government corporation to get it done


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] waltor#3519
Then I can oversee it and get it done outside of Parliament

@ChairmanMeeseeks a lot


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] waltor#3519
Estimates have ranged from $200 billion to $20 trillion, but most likely around $1 trillion.


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
well i was gonna give you a Quango


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the entire range?


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
for 1 tril?


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] waltor#3519
More than just the range.


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the city too?


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] waltor#3519
Both ranges, all the canals and shit.


[11-Aug-18 06:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the entire fuckin thing?


[11-Aug-18 06:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
for 1 tril?


[11-Aug-18 06:13 PM] waltor#3519
Well the city is prime real estate, so it'll sell really well


[11-Aug-18 06:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
when you said it would cost 20 and give us 1 tril in revenue per year?


[11-Aug-18 06:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
it pays for itself in a year?


[11-Aug-18 06:13 PM] waltor#3519
Adding in a few titchy bits of infrastructure might cost a few billion, but it'd make it far more attractive real estate

[11-Aug-18 06:13 PM] waltor#3519
Well when I revised the figures


[11-Aug-18 06:13 PM] waltor#3519
The costs went way down, but the revenue brought on by the range also went a long way down as well


[11-Aug-18 06:14 PM] waltor#3519
We're looking at maybe $500b a year from agriculture exports at best, but of course, relatively that's a lot more than $1t/y:$20t


[11-Aug-18 06:14 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
.


[11-Aug-18 06:15 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so this doesnt give the economy a huge benis?


[11-Aug-18 06:15 PM] waltor#3519
This range would give us the ability to boost our population enormously


[11-Aug-18 06:15 PM] waltor#3519
and expand manufacturing and services


[11-Aug-18 06:15 PM] waltor#3519
We could end up larger than China


[11-Aug-18 06:15 PM] waltor#3519

[11-Aug-18 06:15 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

although, that does sort out my problem for the Atlantis project


[11-Aug-18 06:16 PM] waltor#3519
We could take immigrants from Africa, since they'll have a population explosion over the next 50 or so years


[11-Aug-18 06:16 PM] waltor#3519
Like billions of people are going to be born


[11-Aug-18 06:17 PM] waltor#3519
@ChairmanMeeseeks when I said $500b/y from agriculture exports, the real estate and manufacturing in the range remains the same


[11-Aug-18 06:17 PM] waltor#3519
So our economy would is benis larg


[11-Aug-18 06:17 PM] waltor#3519
e


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
woah


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so it was like 4 tril


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and 2 of that was agri


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] waltor#3519
Yeah.


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so, its 2.5?


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] waltor#3519
So we'll be down a bit, but still big benis


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] waltor#3519
Yeah


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
tril to the gdp


[11-Aug-18 06:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
for only one trillion


[11-Aug-18 06:19 PM] waltor#3519
Of course, like the analysis of the actual cost and agri benefits, I'll have to do one with the proposed cities in the range


[11-Aug-18 06:19 PM] waltor#3519
Could end up far better, could end up far worse


[11-Aug-18 06:19 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and we take about 25% of gdp roughly
625 billion

I mean it goes without saying that saying Intersex people have made a "lifestyle choice" is ludicrous considering they were literally born that way, but I suppose it goes back to the Liberal idea that life has a character creation screen, and poor people made the mistake of not buffing their parents with money stat and taking the intersex trait.

'Gay genes': science is on the right track, we're born this way. L...
A recent article argued that sexuality is down to choice, not genetics. But the scientific evidence says otherwise, and points to a strong biological origin

[14-Aug-18 06:36 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Biometric modeling revealed that, in men, genetic effects explained .34‚Äì.39 of the variance [of sexual orientation], the shared environment .00, and the individual-specific environment .61‚Äì.66 of the variance. Corresponding estimates among women were .18‚Äì.19 for genetic factors, .16‚Äì.17 for shared environmental, and .64‚Äì.66 for unique environmental factors. Although wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation, the results are consistent with moderate, primarily genetic, familial effects, and moderate to large effects of the nonshared environment (social and biological) on same-sex sexual behavior.[12]

thats the source for the following wiki quote


[14-Aug-18 07:01 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The longstanding consensus of scientific research and clinical literature demonstrate that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality.


[14-Aug-18 07:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
other than that, medical journals really dont write about it, its primarily scientific


[14-Aug-18 07:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but for the scientific studies, i gave a study that found it was genetic


[14-Aug-18 07:05 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
for the causes of homosexuality, it wont really be published in medical journals because theres no hard conclusion on the exact source, other than it isnt really a choice


[14-Aug-18 07:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and by that i mean, any ideas on said source that are in the mix arent at all "its a choice"


[14-Aug-18 07:08 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so, in the way its fact that they've (genetic and medical researchers) basically ruled out "its a choice", dkr is actually right in the base aspect of its widely regarded as not being a choice


[14-Aug-18 07:08 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
tl:dr all respectable scientific/medical study on this have come to differing conclusions, none of them being its a choice

The problem with these Left wing Liars is that they are the very embodiment of the Red Scare itself and we must be prepared for the consequences that they will imperil us with, the Socialist Plot against Western Democracy still threatens Australia to this very hour and they have well demonstrated their ambiguity to communism itself, they embrace all forms of leftism in the tent of trotsky, living a life under the banner of Lenin. The New Left today that has risen from the ashes like a demented phoenix that should have stayed dead in 1991 is the same old bird that threatened us and our allies in the days of the Cold War, the Labour party was once a somewhat respectable party institution, however with people with the likes of Youma in charge, the Soviet Scare is still prevalent in our politics, and is a threat to our Australia, and a threat to our democracy. Stand with us, and fight for a Liberal Australia, free from communist oppression, vote Liberal!

That is the end goal of it, the communist party of the soviet union never planned for that however, especially under stalin.

@Youmaton you silently advocate for an ideology that lost 27 years ago and seek to further tear apart of Australian society through your own twisted globalist agenda. I, personally, put faith in my constituents and service unto them above all else as my presence in the parliamentary chambers debating legislation is one that must be taken with the utmost humility but simultaneously pride. I'm not going to accuse you of dividing, as you seek to unite through lies and misery with puppets by pulling strings. In modern day politics, you are the one that we should be rallying against

[23-Aug-18 12:13 PM] _slothsworth#4496
We've discussed his plans in regards to his work on the Carpentarian Range.


[23-Aug-18 12:15 PM] _slothsworth#4496
While I will leave to @waltor to inform you of his plans, I will say that steps have been taken to ensure that CSID will be able to continue this work -- this may or may not include the vacation of his Justice position when the project reaches its critical moments, however, I assure the public that this will not be in the near future at all.

Why is CSID not being banned from the Carpentarian Range Project because it‚Äôs a meme


[23-Aug-18 12:18 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
Come at me


[23-Aug-18 12:19 PM] Youmaton#1190
On a personal behalf, I do question the appointment of Maxweel to the bench, given his lack to contribution to the Senate. However, I am not looking to undermine the appointment, I hope that Maxwell will be able to prove himself.

[23-Aug-18 12:20 PM] _slothsworth#4496
Maxwell's tenure in the past speaks for itself.


[23-Aug-18 12:20 PM] _slothsworth#4496
Given the nature of this forum (m; canon), I cannot detail all of his previous roles.

@phyllicanderer The Carpentarian Range project is not a meme.


[23-Aug-18 12:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is a beautiful project to give the Australian economy, as others have described: "a huge benis"


[23-Aug-18 12:21 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
Having had serious discussions with CSID about the project, there are many environmental issues to be resolved before it‚Äôs undertaken


[23-Aug-18 12:22 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
And I do not support it

Of course, but those will be resolved


[23-Aug-18 12:22 PM] _slothsworth#4496
Please do approach me on a full list of his previous roles, however, to summarise -- he has taken key administrative and legal roles in both private sector organisations overseas and here.


[23-Aug-18 12:22 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
I look forward to seeing his expertise demonstrated

The Carpentarian Range is being considered seriously and will be debated in the Mountain Mob for some time to come.


[23-Aug-18 03:54 PM] waltor#3519
I will be moving onto more judicial business and putting the MMP on the back burner for the next few months.

ok @TheGRV . Firstly, I invited you to join the panel. You declined. Secondly, I interviewed Robert to challenge his opinions and show that he was wrong. Thirdly, Direct Action is NOT the ALP's network and I have no obligations as Party Chair to give you any platform. Youmaton, Shitpost, Sprinkles and I all happen to be on the team of DA. It's not the ALP's channel. FOURTH THING, I *am* the proud founder of the Rainbow Labour group! You don't get to come here and demand a platform on the network because you want to run. There are many members of the party who want to run, some of them weren't as lucky as you to have the party leader interview you! SO, be grateful for what we've done for you! Stop attacking me for doing my job! and be fucking civil about shit!

I sincerely apologize for raising personal matters and fully accept everyones view of the complete wrongness of the act. I also apologize to Labour Party for causing such division and fully accept my expulsion from the party. I sincerely hope that is understood by the public. With that I'll continue as an Independent and prove I am a better person from who I was three years ago and be able to demonstrate to the public I can acknowledge when I have done wrong and better myself. Thank you.

Sorry to put you in this position, but I need  I need to resign.
These last two weeks have been been a nightmare, but I've come under the realisation that most of my weeks until the end of November will be nightmarishly full like this.
And after November, I would be gone for weeks in exchange overseas.
Furthermore, I've been dealing with some personal issues and some relationship issues, and although I've never been happier, I don't think I can dedicate the time to the sim anymore that it needs from the CJ.
I think it's irresponsible for me to continue holding the position in my situation, so I would like to resign. Sorry. This will be posted on reddit shortly once I get back home.)

[17-Sep-18 07:06 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Could you not resign your senate seat first?


[17-Sep-18 07:28 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
@TheWhiteFerret Yes you don't need a National Executive when you have a party of two people but when you have more than thirty it takes *multiple days* to resolve things at conference, and so we need an elected Executive to make decisions quickly, which can then be questioned and voted on by members if they disagree.


[17-Sep-18 07:33 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[17-Sep-18 07:35 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Could you not resign your seat and given it to a labor member?
Or had a supplementary election for it?


[17-Sep-18 07:46 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
The Greens avoid this for the reason that decision making has to be transparent or you create disconnect between that executive and the wider party. Mind you, we only have four members so a NatEx would be stupid at this point.


[17-Sep-18 07:48 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You are basically all the National Executive when you are that small.


[17-Sep-18 07:48 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Yes


[17-Sep-18 07:48 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
However, our constitution is written to ban any national executive.


[17-Sep-18 07:49 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
So even if we had thirty members, everything has to pass with 75% of members assenting and all debate has to be open to membership


[17-Sep-18 07:50 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
And the party secretary - me at the moment - has to pass decisions by motion, which must get consensus to pass, unless a motion delegates power to me


[17-Sep-18 07:50 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well, if you ever reach 30 members you will find that as incredibly impractical as we have.


[17-Sep-18 07:51 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
I don‚Äôt think so. Our party could be a litmus test for an anarchist democracy so we‚Äôll see how it goes


[17-Sep-18 07:52 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
I am aware of the pressures that a large, and mostly sporadically active membership brings


[17-Sep-18 07:52 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
75% of members assenting will never be reached.


[17-Sep-18 07:52 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Not due to disagreement, but inactivity

[17-Sep-18 03:41 PM] Tabias#1747
Fellow Australians. I would like to engage in a conversation regarding the establishment of the Australian Federation Council. The Australian Federation Council would be composed of the Premiers of each state within our federation and would serve as a separate democratic body charged with the task of implementing policy at a state level. 

The election of state premiers would serve as a stepping stone into state parliaments.

My question then, to the Australian people, is this something you wish to see? Should there be an Australian Federation Council? Should the Federal Parliament remain the sole legislative body?

I'd like to hear what you think.

It is an extreme answer to states rights. I think it is the answer to the wrong question.

[17-Sep-18 03:47 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

No you really didn't understand it griffo because your preconceived notions of sex gave you the idea that you shouldn't really even try to think about it.

If I may Griffo. Sex is the physical characteristic of someone, it can be changed however there is some discussion around that, Sex isnt just male or female, there is also intersex. Gender is what one identifies as, male, female, non binary, or any other gender identity.  @Deleted User

@Deleted User In terms of male, female, or other, speaking strictly about sex, not gender, other is not a category either. There are only two sexes, male and female. Klinefelter syndrome does not make one 'other'. It makes them both. Kind of like the intersection of a Venn diagram.

Indeed you may be born male but really your gender is female which is based on real things but somehow is also a social construct and  doesn't actually exist.

@Deleted User I think the issue with the statement was actually gender is a personality thing you identify with, not something you choose
You could theoretically alter your personality to be more feminine/masculine but it's still not really a choice per say

Griffo: I am not transphobic

Ah well if you don't have an irrational fear or hatred of them you can't have a phobia

Queerphobia: The fear of ANYTHING that is not hetero-normative including, but not limited to, homosexuality, bisexuality, transgender etc.

Yes the Australian government has repeatedly blocked Chinese coorperations from owning vital infrastructure. I agree with that the Chinese coorperations are basically an extension of theur givernment. But i have a problem when people start saying that Chinese immigrants are secret spies, while not explicitly racist per say it definitely has racist under tones. There is no evidence of this and all these kind of statements for the is perpetuate racism towards Chinese people who probably r trying to get away from their gov @Deleted User

Yes but I think it's still pretty far fetched to believe what the Chinese governments is deliberately sabotaging the projects they are building in their one road initiave (I'm not sure of the specifics but arnt for the most part they just lending money) while it's definitely a ploy to gain greater control of these nations through increased political capital and reliance as a consequence I don't believe their intention is to leverage kill switches. Moreover I think for the most part this one belt on road intiatove will be great for humanity as it will see those poorer countries experiance a trade boom, prosperity and hopefully progressiveness along with it. It should be mentioned that China has repeatedly stated that it had no intentions to spread it's domestic institutions which I believe because why on Earth would they want to @Deleted User

@adamtad no they want it built they just gove them loans they can't pay back and so will then take ownership of the asset. And the reason why they want to spread their institutions and way of thinking is so they can have more influence within those countries and more support from the people and the governments.


[26-Sep-18 09:07 PM] Matt Monti#4771
YOU are the reason transgender people kill themselves. NOT because they have a penis. People like YOU saying SHIT like this is what makes LGBTQIA+ youth THREE FUCKING TIMES more likely to kill themselves than their peers.

SO DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE start talking about how it's all OUR fault that we want to commit suicide. I am sick of you think that saying this shit is OK. IT'S NOT FUCKING OK.

@adamtad Put yourselves in Griffo's shoes. Telling an anorexic that it's ok to not eat is the equivalent of telling a biological man that they can be a woman. This is his perception. He doesn't care it is offensive, it is in the interest of the anorexic to tell them to eat. By the same token, he feels it is in the trans person's interest to tell them they are a man.

Griffo should be demonstrating the link between transgenderism and depression and suicide, perhaps noting that transgender persons in the US have the second highest suicidality rates of any minority in history behind the Jews in WWII, and making the case that their persecution is so far detached from Nazi Germany that the cause of trans suicides is likely not solely social discrimination by what seems to be a minority of people who are anti-trans in a civilised Western societ.

And all of you should be pointing to data that suggests bullying is much more serious and that depressing is separate from trangenderism and that the high rates of commonality between transgenderism and depression is largely coincidentally, or at least not causally related.

I think Griffo has a point. He is being disrespected and that is what is stifling he debate. I understand others here feel Griffo is disrespecting you, but you need to understand that, in his position, he feels that he is treating you with respect in that he thinks that he is doing you and the trans community a significant service by telling what he perceives to be truth, albeit a hard truth.

Present Griffo with facts, acknowledge each other as individuals with positive intentions, and then, through parliament, enact the policies which you deem to be most positive, regardless of whether a conclusion is reached or not, although even in that case maintaining respect for the opposing party.

Well I think he was saying that someone was because they wanted to kill themselves by virtue of having a penis


[26-Sep-18 09:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because of his view that it is a disease, it is also his view that he is doing something to assist them

Which is a conclusion you can present to Griffo, which he can disagree with, whilst both of you acknowledge that the other is just trying to do their best to heighten Australia's quality of life.

@BellmanTGM You just compared taking an illicit harmful substance away from an addict to doing an action in the ideal of not ‚Äòlatching on to what they view themselves as‚Äô which causes mental health issues to transgender individuals. Am I correct?

@TheGRV Yes, as the intent in the former is the same as Griffo's intent in the latter. I myself do not hold that view. But understanding that Griffo does is what brings about healthy debate.

No @ChairmanMeeseeks it went I have penis therefore I feel like killing myself/ Sounds like you might need some mental health treatment / trans people do not have a mental disorder / but that doesn't mean you can't or don't have one. Your analogy doesn't follow that


[26-Sep-18 09:49 PM] TheGRV#7916
Ok. Good. At least you don‚Äôt hold that view. Because that is genuinely misguided.

[26-Sep-18 10:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No?

Because either means of cure is extremely dangerous.


[26-Sep-18 10:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
so you think it would be the moral position to allow the 'sufferer' to commit suicide, rather than prevent it?


[26-Sep-18 10:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But without the cure, suicide is highly likely.

[26-Sep-18 10:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Chosen gender, not sex


[26-Sep-18 10:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
That's the counter argument, but again, you lack tact, just as Griffo also assuredly does


[26-Sep-18 10:15 PM] Deleted User#0000

[26-Sep-18 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
My gender is female. My sex is male and I can't change that despite how fucking much I want to


[26-Sep-18 10:16 PM] LuisAPI#8555
Sex =/= gender ^^^^


[26-Sep-18 10:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Although I would argue, whilst Griffo is not being tactful, he also isn't being spiteful, unlike most people against him, who are not tactful and are spiteful.


[26-Sep-18 10:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think that's why I'm sympathetic towards him.


[26-Sep-18 10:17 PM] TheGRV#7916
@Deleted User @LuisAPI (M: Sincere apologies. First time I‚Äôve screwed that up in a long time.)


[26-Sep-18 10:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Again no need to be meta


[26-Sep-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Gender is what people see if you. If someone was concerned about your sex then that is a different story. Only time that is acceptable is when you literally want to reproduce


[26-Sep-18 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
But if someone randomly is concerned about whether you are of the biological male or female sex with no proper reason then that is just horrible


[26-Sep-18 10:18 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway if Griffo's trans argument could be treated with the same understanding which eventuated in our abortion debate on #twitter earlier this evening @TheGRV, then I think the environment here would end up much more positive than it is now üòÑ


[26-Sep-18 10:19 PM] TheGRV#7916
@BellmanTGM I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm too emotionally invested to do so,

[26-Sep-18 10:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Mhm, in a debate you ought to try and detach yourself emotionally to heighten your rationality. It is difficult to do, absolutely, and I've been one to lose my cool, of course, we all do. But we should strive for that understanding.


[26-Sep-18 10:20 PM] TheGRV#7916

@BellmanTGM It‚Äôs very very hard when my bestie is why I‚Äôm into this issue so much.


[26-Sep-18 10:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I am also a fan of it and am using it here, and use it often in the abortion argument


[26-Sep-18 10:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[26-Sep-18 10:22 PM] waltor#3519
Does anyone remember when galt went odd and became a national?


[26-Sep-18 10:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@TheGRV I understand, but I think if you came to the understanding that people like Griffo don't hate your bestie, but rather, care for their well being, that helps your discussion remain positive.


[26-Sep-18 10:22 PM] TheGRV#7916
Most of my views on this come from him. I‚Äôve been supportive of him since the day he came out to me.


[26-Sep-18 10:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Do keep in mind there are people who do just genuinely consider trans people gross and hopeless...

GRV you're missing the point


[26-Sep-18 10:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But again, calling him an arsehole won't help him change is mind. In fact it probably has the opposite effect. Again, you're lacking tact. he does too. If he held those opinions but still carried himself differently I think it would be extremely positive.


[26-Sep-18 10:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Both need to understand where the other is coming from, and go to the discussion table with a mutual respect.


[26-Sep-18 10:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
There will still almost certainly be disagreement at the end.


[26-Sep-18 10:25 PM] TheGRV#7916

Ok. With that. Continue.


[26-Sep-18 10:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And he probably feels the same as you, and he needs to do the same.


[26-Sep-18 10:27 PM] TheGRV#7916
It‚Äôs really hard to hold tact when he‚Äôs thinking is insulting what they see themselves as will help.


[26-Sep-18 10:28 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well I think his insulting them is where he is lacking tact


[26-Sep-18 10:28 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But generally speaking if you meet abrasiveness with gentleness, things calm down

[26-Sep-18 10:29 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Griffo is also misguided in his tact, I think, although even then he might think his strategy is sound, though I disagree


[26-Sep-18 10:29 PM] TheGRV#7916
I should note, my besties also ace and aro. I once asked stupid deeply personal questions wanting to understand what that meant and yeah. I had to learn to not ask those kinds of things. It‚Äôs hard trying to understand these kinds of subjects.


[26-Sep-18 10:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I just took this side because Griffo was being ganged up on lol, and treated spitefully, whereas his lack of tact is not, in my opinion, couples with any similar spitefulness


[26-Sep-18 10:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I can only imagine, given I have no fucking clue what ace and aro means haha


[26-Sep-18 10:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But that's a secondary point


[26-Sep-18 10:30 PM] TheGRV#7916
Oh. Asexual and Aromantic.


[26-Sep-18 10:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And again, trust me, I understand where you are coming from, but this is like a 'life-hack' now. Gentleness is an extremely positive persuasive tool, or at least a discursive tool.


[26-Sep-18 10:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Which can be backed up Biblically too üòâ


[26-Sep-18 10:32 PM] TheGRV#7916
So you know the bestie I met yesterday? I previously had to explain to them Asexuality meant you weren‚Äôt sexually attracted to *people*. That doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt have sexual feelings at times.

I'm a very firmly devout Christian and I look forward to religious discussions moving forward, but one deeply philosophical conversation is enough for tonight hahaha, I just returned from a Christian Students Committee retreat which was 2 days of straight philosophical discussion lol, I am growing weary haha.


[26-Sep-18 10:35 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But I will say all of my opinions, political or otherwise, I try to find external facts and figures to base them on. It is only natural for one who believes in the Bible to believe that what it says manifests itself in the external world also.


[26-Sep-18 10:35 PM] TheGRV#7916
As soon as someone uses the Bible for an argument. I immediately stop hearing it, because that illustrates you don‚Äôt care about the other things the Bible advocates. You‚Äôll just use the point best benefiting you.


[26-Sep-18 10:35 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
wew i predicted your argument before you made it hahaha

Again, if one believes what the Bible has to say, they ought to, by extension, believe it manifests itself in the outside world, and should point out those instances in debate given that many do not share your beliefs and will not buy the Bible in and of itself.

but the PFC faction of reason is weird because reason is welfare plus free markets whereas PFC was basically ron swanson


[07-Oct-18 04:24 PM] Youmaton#1190
Liberals here aren't like American libs, libs here are conservative

[07-Oct-18 04:25 PM] DexterAamo#8504
PFC


[07-Oct-18 04:25 PM] Rat#1042
part of free citizens


[07-Oct-18 04:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
The party of free citizens was a laissez-faire party that dissolved a few weeks ago

The structure is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the Single Transferable Vote most of the details will go over a typical voter‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Droop‚Äôs proportionality criterion, which is deftly woven into its details- the mechanism of counting draws heavily from Thomas Hare‚Äôs work, for instance. The psephologists understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these criteria, to realise that they‚Äôre not just democratic- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Single Transferable Vote truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth)‚Äôs existential long title ‚ÄúAn Act to Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to the Barton government‚Äôs classic epics, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 (Cth) and Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 (Cth). I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Antony Green‚Äôs genius methodology unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. :joy:

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Mackerras pendulum tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the scrutineers‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 2PP percentage points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid :sunglasses: :runas:

[28-Jan-19 10:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
@KyuuMann yeah you'd need to specify a uni for an answer, it differs between each uni. Most Uni's will have a general unit description when they do a degree, what you need to do for credits etc, which in turn you can check out. So for instance "Ancient History requires minimum 10 units (im making this whole example up btw), with 5 courses on offer, Rome 3 units, Warring States China 4 units, Ptolemaic Egypt 2 units, Assyria 3 units, Maya 4 units" and then you could look at say Rome and see it has a lecture on the Marian military reforms which would be compulsory attendance and whatnot


[28-Jan-19 10:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
So SydUni I know for a fact does the Unit breakdown, idk about the specifics of the unit tho. ANU also I believe does it.

BC does have a point though. After themselves and us (UAP), who are the Liberals going to preference next? Socialists? SocDems? The "Centre" Alliance? Fascists?

The Centre Alliance are the only party standing up against the extremes of the far left and the far right. We need a new politics outside of this broken spectrum that cares about people and businesses equally, that cares about the essential coal mining companies and the plight of climate change totally equally, and that supports a progressive taxation system along with a flat tax for everyone. We need to restore balance to Australian politics.

As a Cabinet Minister present at that meeting, I can confirm the Prime Minister did not utter such rude words.


[23-Mar-19 11:47 PM] Eehee#6658
#abc-feed reported it as the Deputy Prime Minister's words, which were indeed uttered.


[23-Mar-19 11:48 PM] Eehee#6658
It's a shame we have a government full of UDP members who find themselves unable to comprehensively read news reports before commenting publicly.


[23-Mar-19 11:49 PM] Eehee#6658
The words from the article are as follows: 

`On the Harmony Day motion, Eehee referred again to the UDP's opposition to the Transphobia motion last term, to which the Deputy Prime Minister told Eehee to "get fucked" and called him a dickhead in the cabinet meeting.`


[23-Mar-19 11:58 PM] DirtySaiyan#0464

Kennt ihr das auch?
Manchmal fehlt nur ein Minihauch,
dann w√§r' die Welt perfekt.
Fast jeden Tag,
tu ich das was ich am liebsten mag,
das ist nicht jedem Recht.
Ich l√ºge nie,
ich sag' dir wie ich mich f√ºhl'.
Nu los, wecke alle meine Freunde,
ja jetzt bist du dran,
Chancen musst du schneller greifen,
Pack sie an, geh ran,
sieh einfach alles von der besten Seite,
es ist halt wie es ist
nun spring nicht von den Rest,
den √ºberl√§sst du mir.
√úberlass sie mir
√úberlass sie mir,
ja √ºberlass sie mir.

As an SDP defector, I have to question this statement. It seems that the SDP has a problem with the enablement of bigotry and those with bigoted views. That you are yet to be expelled from your party is disgraceful.

@FuckCorona nobody should have taken anything you said seriously about the Liberal party then. You cant have it both ways. I still think people who defect should face byelections, but if they have substantive reasons for leaving, they should not be ignored.

If someone is principled and truly believes that something that is happening with their party is a violation of their beliefs and principles then I think it is fair enough that they leave, though they should face a byelection. If I had been in the same situation I probably would have defected myself, as I would have in your position.

*MattMonti stops by Mosely Square to grab some ice-cream with his family. Whilst there he was asked about his plans for the upcoming election to which he responded: "To be honest mate I just want to grab an ice cream with the kids not talk about politics alright?" Clearly the former member for Adelaide is enjoying some personal time before discussing any campaign issues.*

due to the addition of the bauhinias?

Yes but Wollongong Monarchs? Brisbane Lions which is an aussie rules club? Why Port Adelaide Sharks which don't even exist when you have a strong Adelaide base. Even if you said Port Adelaide why not the Pirates?

Well I mean, PinkNews isn‚Äôt meant to be appealing to a wider audience. It‚Äôs intentions are to appeal to a specific group in society, in this case LGBT people and those who associate themselves with it as well as individuals who take a liking to politics more favourable to what I would describe as centre and left of centre.


[15-Dec-19 01:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I‚Äôm not going to make suggestions because I think your overall audience is pleased because I, like others who disagree with the values it espouses, aren‚Äôt going to be changed by what it tells us because we don‚Äôt belong to such a community.

Well Griffo if you had read an article. You would know that it actually is meant to appeal a wider audience.


[15-Dec-19 02:02 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The whole aim is to make more people aware problems faced by the LGBTQIA+ community


[15-Dec-19 02:02 PM] Matt Monti#4771
When Alex was discussing the idea with me he told me he wanted more people to be supportive of the community. The only way we could do that is get people aware


[15-Dec-19 02:03 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Hence the informative and argumentative nature of the articles. They are meant to argue a perspective and make a point


[15-Dec-19 02:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes and whilst I'm all for gay people and all that jazz, I disagree with it's views on how large these issues are and the methods of preventing the further rise in these problems. There was a big thing about the differences between gender and sex and misgendering people the other day and whilst you may be pushing that case how it is different, there's another audience who disagrees with that and look to other fact based scientific institution such as the American College of Pediatrics who disagree with such ideas.


[15-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Hence articles like that, which I wrote, take a less argumentative and more informative approach. It‚Äôs meant to inform. I know some people don‚Äôt want to change their ideas, which is sad. But for those who do I hope my article can do that.


[15-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I get that the issues PinkNews focuses on aren‚Äôt big for you


[15-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Why would they be? But that‚Äôs not the point.


[15-Dec-19 02:07 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The reason PinkNews writes about these issues is because they aren‚Äôt big for the wider public. They don‚Äôt get a lot of attention.

[15-Dec-19 02:12 PM] Matt Monti#4771
But again if that‚Äôs not what you took away it is your right to take away what you would like to.


[15-Dec-19 02:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
That is the intention of your organisation. 

*"PinkNews is an organization that focuses on LGBTQIA+ issues. We will offer articles on Lifestyle, News & Current Affairs, Sports, Arts, Economics and more. All with a keen focus on LGBTQIA+ views and interests."*

You've said that mainstream media is focused on heterosexual society and has pushed away the gay community but I'm not seeing how sport, or the economy or current affairs has anything to do with LGBT people. You're making up a problem and then trying to use these made up problems to advance a specific agenda and set of views onto your readers through this organisation.


[15-Dec-19 02:21 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Because contrary to popular belief, LGBTQIA+ people also engage in sports, are involved in the economy, and yes have current affairs interests. We are just like everyone else. PinkNews is a hole where LGBTQIA+ people can feel welcomed and those who want to learn more about us can learn how to support us. But again, I really don‚Äôt want to make this an argument. My only point is I was trying to make the organisation one that everyone can feel welcomed in. If you don‚Äôt want to offer your thoughts on changes that could be made that is your absolute right. But I don‚Äôt want to get into an argument about my Husbands network. We‚Äôll just have to agree to disagree

How're you holding up? It seems like people are against your role in the SDP now. Can I just say that no matter what they say, I know that you can push through, I've seen you go through other gunfire, and here you are now.

Thanks mate. Yeah it's been a bit rough. But hey, that's politics. *drinks* No one really seems to be civil anymore. No "congratulations" or "all the best." All you get now is a "Wow the SDP are shit" or "He's gonna be a terrible leader."

[24-Dec-19 01:26 PM] Matt Monti#4771
But yeah I think we can all agree an opinion article isn‚Äôt going to please everyone.


[24-Dec-19 01:26 PM] Anacornda#0630
Considering what they said about me isn't very true anymore, while I did say I had a lack of confidence back then, I since during Question Time Stated that I have confidence now, so I'm wondering why they'd include that in their article


[24-Dec-19 01:26 PM] inactive#6974
Yes I agree


[24-Dec-19 01:26 PM] Anacornda#0630
But at the end of the day, if its an opinion piece, I can't really tell them what to write

I‚Äôm still thinking about how to legislate against discrimination in Blood donations.


[24-Dec-19 02:04 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I think it might be better to amend the Anti-discrimination legislation already in operation to include a clause in which Blood Donations made by LGBTQIA+ are not to rejected because of outdated MSM prejudice


[24-Dec-19 02:09 PM] Anacornda#0630
I've just had a look and I think that would be a state government thing unfortunately

If you need a mentor... look no further than this 8 time parliamentarian


[12-Jan-20 10:00 AM] NGSpy#8096
not a bad idea actually


[12-Jan-20 10:00 AM] Matt Monti#4771

I engineered teleportation technology. He must've bought that anonymously.


[12-Jan-20 10:08 AM] Anacornda#0630
Ah


[12-Jan-20 10:08 AM] NGSpy#8096
I also engineered animal morphing technology before I became a politician.


[12-Jan-20 10:08 AM] Anacornda#0630
I noticed


[12-Jan-20 10:08 AM] Lach#9842
Nice


[12-Jan-20 10:10 AM] NGSpy#8096
The animal morphing technology is a bit strange in the respect that the user retains human speech and thoughts.


[12-Jan-20 10:11 AM] NGSpy#8096
So if you haven't guessed, that's how I became a penguin üôÇ


[12-Jan-20 10:11 AM] NGSpy#8096
And I liked being a penguin so much that I just stayed that way.


[12-Jan-20 10:11 AM] Anacornda#0630

They manage government business in the House of Representatives.


[19-Jan-20 03:53 PM] Anacornda#0630
(M: Don't think they have much of a job in sim, nothing in the SOs at least)


[19-Jan-20 03:54 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: I know! I want power again. IRL they do the job that clerks do, choosing when peoples business gets introduced)


[19-Jan-20 03:54 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: Also IRL they get to choose the dorothy dix questions that the government ask)


[19-Jan-20 03:54 PM] NGSpy#8096
Anacornda, would you think that a stool like this would get me kicked out of the house for being a prop?


[19-Jan-20 03:54 PM] Anacornda#0630
(M: We do it do you don't prioritise Gov bills üòõ )


[19-Jan-20 03:55 PM] Anacornda#0630
Probably, yes


[19-Jan-20 03:55 PM] JAYDEN#5487
No


[19-Jan-20 03:56 PM] NGSpy#8096
What should I do to make up for my height loss as a penguin then?


[19-Jan-20 03:56 PM] JAYDEN#5487
It should be classified as a physical handicap


[19-Jan-20 03:56 PM] Anacornda#0630
Stand on your seat


[19-Jan-20 03:56 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Just go to the local cinemas and grab one of those booster seats


[19-Jan-20 03:57 PM] NGSpy#8096
Remember senator, I'll be at the dispatch box, so I don't think I could stand on my seat and be at the dispatch box.

Dear All Who Read This In The Bar,
As you all know, I am the prime nootster, and many of you know me as a penguin. I am afraid to tell you all that I am an actual human being who just has a very elaborate and amazing engineered suit to make me look like the cartoon penguin pingu. I then proceeded to don a cowboy hat and cowboy clothes after seeing funny memes of McNoot. I did this to relate to my voters and to make a historic achievement and for people to make me seem funny and relatable. I feel that I must say this to you fellow MPs and Senators so you can understand me a little better and to not confuse you all. I would like to clarify some things with this. I am still a heterosexual male who is not interested in any sexual relations with animals or people dressing up as animals, I only don my penguin costume to entertain the Australian public and to make parliament more engaging. I hope you do not think of me differently telling you this and I hope you all enjoyed my story.
Sincerely,
NGSpy the Prime Nootster

I'm not familiar with that, SocialistAcid, could you explain?


[01-Mar-20 07:00 PM] SocialistAcid#2094
It is the **HMAS Otama**. An Oberon class submarine that served through to 2003. It has been set aside to be preserved for a naval museum in Hastings, but the proposals have been continuously denied public funding and approval by the state government. It is a shame to be honest. I reckon it will at least bring a few jobs to the area.


[01-Mar-20 07:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh, interesting.


[01-Mar-20 07:02 PM] SocialistAcid#2094
Especially considering that the Naval veterans that served aboard during its commission are personally funding efforts to maintain it.

No worries, gotta shout some good blokes food sometimes


[07-Apr-20 04:36 PM] NGSpy#8096
I've been trying to drink these in moderation more due to the unfair comments by the Leader of the Opposition.


[07-Apr-20 04:36 PM] NGSpy#8096
It's working quite well.


[07-Apr-20 04:37 PM] Explosivo2002#5778
Don't worry, they attacked Hawkey as an an alcoholic and he was one of our best PM's


[07-Apr-20 04:37 PM] NGSpy#8096
Ah yeah true dat.


[07-Apr-20 04:37 PM] NGSpy#8096
I should probably chill out though just in general.

[07-Apr-20 04:37 PM] Explosivo2002#5778
Probably


[07-Apr-20 04:38 PM] Explosivo2002#5778
But hey, at least drinking isn't as bad as shoving our own heads up our asses


[07-Apr-20 04:38 PM] Explosivo2002#5778
Because the Nats are addicted to that


[07-Apr-20 04:38 PM] NGSpy#8096
Hear hear!


[07-Apr-20 04:38 PM] Explosivo2002#5778
You think they actually stand a chance of winning?


[07-Apr-20 04:39 PM] NGSpy#8096
As I said last night mate, it is never wise to predict the future, otherwise you risk being all the more disappointed.


[07-Apr-20 04:40 PM] Explosivo2002#5778

[07-Apr-20 04:42 PM] NGSpy#8096
Thank you.


[07-Apr-20 04:42 PM] NGSpy#8096
It took me years of practice to get that good.


[07-Apr-20 04:43 PM] Explosivo2002#5778
I wasnt ever that good at it, archery and javelin were always my sport


[07-Apr-20 04:43 PM] NGSpy#8096

The fastest Noot in the West, they say


[07-Apr-20 04:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
I don't think the Leader of the Opposition would want to mess with the Prime Nootster now.


[07-Apr-20 04:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
Yeah they do say that Explosivo.


[07-Apr-20 04:45 PM] Explosivo2002#5778

[07-Apr-20 04:47 PM] NGSpy#8096

Dear Winston,
As much as you are a fucking cunt, and I do not accept some of your policies, the people of Robertson has spoken. I have every faith that you will act rational to get the best for Robertson, and to continue the work I started. Robertson is a very important place, it has some great beaches and some great people, please do not let them down.

I wish you the best on the front benches, god bless, I will see you back in 3 months.
Kind Regards, 
The Hon Dr Jayden Mattias Williamson-Corman OAM PhD Ex-MP

[06-Sep-20 06:49 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Senate rather


[06-Sep-20 06:49 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So if we go by your logic Griffo, that the Senate should influence who is Gov and Oppo, then the SDP should have been Gov last term because of their senate majority.


[06-Sep-20 06:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So either be consistent, or admit you haven't got the right to remain opposition, since your party is absolutely useless
