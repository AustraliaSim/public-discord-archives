http://www.fao.org/docrep/S2022E/s2022e06.htm


[18-Jul-18 02:37 PM] waltor#3519
Desert: less than 100mm
Arid: 100-400mm
Semi-arid: 400-600mm
Sub-humid: 600-1200mm
Moist sub-humid: 1200-1500mm
Humid: more thann 1500mm


[18-Jul-18 02:41 PM] waltor#3519
OK the entire area is pretty much arid


[18-Jul-18 02:45 PM] waltor#3519
so grass needs uh 8mm per day during irrigation season


[18-Jul-18 02:46 PM] waltor#3519
20% grapes - 6mm
20% cucumber - 8mm
20% apples - 8mm
20% wheat - 9mm
20% paddy rice - 10mm


[18-Jul-18 02:48 PM] waltor#3519
grapes: 180 days
cucumber: 70 days
apple: 140 days
wheat: 300 days
paddy rice: 150 days


[18-Jul-18 02:50 PM] waltor#3519
grapes: 1080mm
cucumber: 560mm
apples: 1120mm
wheat: 2700mm
paddy rice: 1500mm


[18-Jul-18 02:50 PM] waltor#3519
ok so each of those has 200,000km2


[18-Jul-18 02:50 PM] waltor#3519
hm


[18-Jul-18 02:52 PM] waltor#3519
grapes 216,000GL
cucumbers 112,000GL
apples: 224,000GL
wheat: 540,000GL
paddy rice: 300,000GL
TOTAL: 1,392km3


[18-Jul-18 02:52 PM] waltor#3519
hmm


[18-Jul-18 02:53 PM] waltor#3519
something went wrong


[18-Jul-18 02:53 PM] waltor#3519
actually no


[18-Jul-18 02:53 PM] waltor#3519
that would need about 44,000m3/s flow


[18-Jul-18 02:53 PM] waltor#3519
somewhat viable hmm

Construction materials will cost a mere $630 billion


[19-Jul-18 01:30 PM] waltor#3519
A triangular prism 700km long, 10km tall and 30km wide has a volume of 210,000km3. 

For typical buildings such as skyscrapers, 85% of a building is air and the other 15% is building material. Carbon fibre is 1000x stronger than steel (typical building material), so a carbon nanotube building could be 0.015% carbon fibre and 99.985% air. 

210,000km3 * 0.015% = 31.5km3 of carbon nanotubes. 

Carbon nanotubes weight approximately 400g per m3, so 31.5 billion m3 * 400g/m3 = 12.6 million tonnes of carbon nanotubes. 

Carbon nanotubes cost approximately $50/kg, so 12.6 billion * 50 = $630b cost for construction materials.

[19-Jul-18 01:32 PM] waltor#3519
700*10*30 is 210k

[19-Jul-18 01:33 PM] waltor#3519
Now how much will the labour cost


[19-Jul-18 01:33 PM] waltor#3519
FUCK I HAVE TO REWRITE THE MATHS NOW OOF


[19-Jul-18 01:33 PM] waltor#3519
.


[19-Jul-18 01:34 PM] waltor#3519
Still, we don't know how many people it will need


[19-Jul-18 01:34 PM] waltor#3519
And how long it will take


[19-Jul-18 01:35 PM] waltor#3519
That's a number we've made up, it could be entirely off


[19-Jul-18 01:35 PM] waltor#3519
I'm assuming we like have a machine that weaves carbon nanotubes


[19-Jul-18 01:35 PM] waltor#3519
That crawls along the side of the mountain


[19-Jul-18 01:35 PM] waltor#3519
Hmm


[19-Jul-18 01:35 PM] waltor#3519
We will need to develop engineering


[19-Jul-18 01:36 PM] waltor#3519
I think crawler machines will be most viable for building it


[19-Jul-18 01:36 PM] waltor#3519
What should I call them

[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] waltor#3519
Probably idunno


[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] waltor#3519
We'll probably need to overshoot a little bit with the amount we use


[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] waltor#3519
Hmm


[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] waltor#3519
50m thick ice = 50 million tonnes per km2


[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] waltor#3519
hmm


[19-Jul-18 01:39 PM] waltor#3519
maybe 25km2 of ice * 700 = a lot


[19-Jul-18 01:40 PM] waltor#3519
875 billion tonnes wew


[19-Jul-18 01:40 PM] waltor#3519
Hmm


[19-Jul-18 01:40 PM] waltor#3519
@Harold We will make the mountain vibrate


[19-Jul-18 01:40 PM] waltor#3519
So the ice falls off as soon as it lands


[19-Jul-18 01:41 PM] waltor#3519
tbf there problably is a way around this


[19-Jul-18 01:41 PM] waltor#3519
the ice would slide off easily since carbon nanotubes aren;t know for being coarse


[19-Jul-18 01:41 PM] waltor#3519
uh


[19-Jul-18 01:41 PM] waltor#3519
hmh


[19-Jul-18 01:42 PM] waltor#3519
I feel like glaciers will never really form because it'll be too slippery


[19-Jul-18 01:43 PM] waltor#3519
They would just slide down the mountain and into the lake


[19-Jul-18 01:43 PM] waltor#3519
yeah

?afk "Fleabass" is the name of the instrument company that Flea, the bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, started in 2009. His goal was to start a music company that could provide young people with high quality bass guitars for affordable prices.

[19-Jul-18 02:18 PM] waltor#3519
This is why there is a dam around it


[19-Jul-18 02:19 PM] waltor#3519
To divert water to where its needed


[19-Jul-18 02:19 PM] waltor#3519
There will be tunnels through the mountain


[19-Jul-18 02:19 PM] waltor#3519
So water can flow from the north to the south


[19-Jul-18 02:19 PM] waltor#3519
Also having this massive body of water means a lot will evapourate


[19-Jul-18 02:19 PM] waltor#3519
due to the aridity of the area


[19-Jul-18 02:19 PM] waltor#3519
And fall elsewhere


[19-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Youmaton#1190
not just the water, the great dividing range is one of the reasons we have such a big desert in australia, another mountain range could do much the same thing


[19-Jul-18 02:20 PM] waltor#3519
The only real environmental issues is the utter destruction of desert habitats


[19-Jul-18 02:20 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[19-Jul-18 02:20 PM] waltor#3519
They will be completely soaked


[19-Jul-18 02:20 PM] waltor#3519
@Youmaton we have a desert for many reasons


[19-Jul-18 02:20 PM] waltor#3519
the GDR, cold ocean currents on the non-mountainous side, our latitude


[19-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Youmaton#1190
another reason i dont have a mountain name is because i cant fit it in my nickname


[19-Jul-18 02:21 PM] waltor#3519
We've got probably the worst continent if you think of those things


[19-Jul-18 02:21 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Get rid of spaces


[19-Jul-18 02:21 PM] waltor#3519
South america is probably the best


[19-Jul-18 02:21 PM] waltor#3519
Equatorial, cold ocean current side has mountains, and warm ocean current side has rolling plains


[19-Jul-18 02:21 PM] waltor#3519
so the rains come in and hit the mountain


[19-Jul-18 02:21 PM] waltor#3519
and drain into the ocean


[19-Jul-18 02:22 PM] waltor#3519

[19-Jul-18 02:29 PM] waltor#3519
OK so the laying machines


[19-Jul-18 02:30 PM] waltor#3519
They move forward


[19-Jul-18 02:30 PM] waltor#3519
10 metres per hour


[19-Jul-18 02:30 PM] waltor#3519
and they lay a 10m wide, 1m thick layer of carbon fibre


[19-Jul-18 02:31 PM] waltor#3519
If 1 machine did it


[19-Jul-18 02:31 PM] waltor#3519
it would take 252 million hours


[19-Jul-18 02:31 PM] waltor#3519
Each machine needs uh 20m of space so we can stack 500 of them

Double-cropping to absorb seasonal shocks

[20-Jul-18 07:12 PM] waltor#3519
100 million hectares of wheat = 300 million tonnes of wheat


[20-Jul-18 07:12 PM] waltor#3519
Wheat @ $200 per tonne = $180 billion dollars per year of wheat sales


[20-Jul-18 07:12 PM] waltor#3519
BUT if we turn it into bread


[20-Jul-18 07:13 PM] waltor#3519
>One bushel of wheat yields approximately 42 pounds of white flour. One bushel of wheat yields approximately 60 pounds of whole-wheat flour. A bushel of wheat yields 42 commercial loaves of white bread (one-and-a-half pound loaves).

Australia‚Äôs climate makes it ideal for the production of high quality medium grain rice and Australian growers produce more rice per hectare than anywhere else in the world. The Australian rice industry leads the world in water use efficiency. From paddock to plate, Australian grown rice uses 50% less water than the global average. Water use per hectare continues to decline because of the industry's commitment to developing high yielding rice varieties that use less water, and the use of world's best management practices.


[20-Jul-18 07:30 PM] waltor#3519
Crops are grown in 5 ‚Äì 25cm of water, depending on the plant‚Äôs growth stage, which provides moisture for the plant and protects it from fluctuations in temperature. Using water to insulate the plant from cold overnight temperatures during January is particularly important for yield. High temperatures and the addition of nitrogen and phosphate fertilisers will improve growth.

Changing climate has stalled Australian wheat yields: study
Australia's wheat harvest has stalled over the past 26 years, and worsening weather is to blame.

1 hectare of rice = 10 tonnes

This is where i do all of my highly experimental working out


[21-Jul-18 12:33 AM] waltor#3519
@Harold apparently actually rice goes for a pretty good price


[21-Jul-18 12:33 AM] waltor#3519
And it had a good yield


[21-Jul-18 12:33 AM] waltor#3519
Something like 10 tonnes a hectare


[21-Jul-18 12:34 AM] waltor#3519
And $500 a tonne


[21-Jul-18 12:34 AM] waltor#3519
$500b was using the revised estimates


[21-Jul-18 12:34 AM] waltor#3519
Wheat is a shit crop in comparison to rice


[21-Jul-18 12:34 AM] waltor#3519
Low price, low yield


[21-Jul-18 12:34 AM] waltor#3519
But it doesn‚Äôt need anywhere near the water


[21-Jul-18 12:35 AM] waltor#3519
Yeah


[21-Jul-18 12:35 AM] waltor#3519
We need to rotate crops to not ruin soil


[21-Jul-18 12:35 AM] waltor#3519
Also pests will probably be confused

[21-Jul-18 12:44 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Has anyone mentioned this about where you‚Äôre building the mountain range and dam?
‚ÄúThe climate is hot with a dry season and a monsoon. The dry season lasts from about April until November and is characterized by very dry southeast to east winds, generated by migratory winter high pressure systems to the south. The wet season lasts from December to March and is characterised by humid northerly monsoonal airflows. This wet season can be very erratic: at Burketown, which is typical of the region, the rainfall of various wet seasons has ranged from as little as 150 millimetres (5.9 in) to as much as 2,000 millimetres (79 in). Overall rainfall is low (from 750 mm on the coast to 500 mm inland) but if the wet season is at all strong, low-lying areas are flooded and even the few sealed roads are cut. The Gulf is also a breeding ground for cyclones during the period between November and April.‚Äù


[21-Jul-18 12:46 AM] waltor#3519
It‚Äôs on the boundary inbetween 2 catchments so it can be dammed effectively


[21-Jul-18 12:46 AM] waltor#3519
Also the rainfall probably doesn‚Äôt make it far inland, but the total precipitable water gets down pretty fsr


[21-Jul-18 12:47 AM] waltor#3519
Total precipitable water is what we‚Äôre interested in


[21-Jul-18 12:47 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
All right, I can‚Äôt support it because it will potentially destroy the ecology of the Gulf Country including endangered species by creating a rain shadow in NW Queensland


[21-Jul-18 12:48 AM] waltor#3519
the monsoon will still fall in everywhere north of the range


[21-Jul-18 12:48 AM] waltor#3519
Everywhere south will have the rivers


[21-Jul-18 12:49 AM] waltor#3519
@phyllicanderer you probably are right though with destructions of ecosystems

__**Potential crops**__
Rice (10t/ha, $400/t) hectares (2500mm/25ML) = 108,000,000 hectares = 1080MT = $432b
Wheat (3t/ha, $200/t) hectares (650mm/6.5ML) = 415,000,000 hectares = 1245MT = $249b
Sugarcane (60t/ha, $300/t) hectares (2500mm/25ML) = 108,000,000 hectares = 6480MT = $1944b
Maize (5t/ha, $200/t) hectares (800mm/8ML) = 337,000,000 hectares = 1685MT = $337b


[21-Jul-18 01:42 PM] waltor#3519
Wheat/sugarcane double cropping
Maize/rice double cropping


[21-Jul-18 01:42 PM] waltor#3519
@ChairmanMeeseeks holy fuck sugar is a real money maker

[21-Jul-18 01:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
heheheheh


[21-Jul-18 01:44 PM] waltor#3519

as in


[21-Jul-18 01:44 PM] waltor#3519
at the moment


[21-Jul-18 01:44 PM] waltor#3519
the world only makes about 140 million tonnes of sugar annually


[21-Jul-18 01:44 PM] waltor#3519
so it's not really viable


[21-Jul-18 01:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so combo it


[21-Jul-18 01:45 PM] waltor#3519
hm


[21-Jul-18 01:45 PM] waltor#3519
ok so 3/4 of the water on wet crops, 1/4 on dry


[21-Jul-18 01:47 PM] waltor#3519
Wheat: 10% = 270km3 = 41 million hectares
Maize: 15% = 405km3 = 50 million hectares
Sugarcane: 35% = 945km3 = (double cropped on wheat) 37 million hectares
Rice: 40% = 1080km3 = (double cropped on maize) 43 million hectares


[21-Jul-18 01:52 PM] waltor#3519
so we're going to need to terraform about 1 million km square of land


[21-Jul-18 01:55 PM] waltor#3519
@Harold thoughts


[21-Jul-18 01:56 PM] waltor#3519
OK


[21-Jul-18 01:56 PM] waltor#3519
I think we could make ethanol


[21-Jul-18 01:57 PM] waltor#3519
The maximum theortical yield of  ethanol from glucose is 0.511g/g of glucose. So the maximum ethanol that can be produced from 14g/L glucose is 7.15g/L ethanol. 1 mole of glucose is oxidised to produce 2 moles of ethanol. I think you need to repeat your experiment as the ethanol obtained is higher and normally with even 90-95% efficiency levels of fermenting yeast the ethanol titre cannot exceed 6.7g/L.

[22-Jul-18 10:45 AM] waltor#3519
no shit we're going to destroy everything


[22-Jul-18 10:45 AM] Youmaton#1190
what measures will be put in to protect said flora and fauna?


[22-Jul-18 10:46 AM] waltor#3519
There will be areas set aside to look after wildlife


[22-Jul-18 10:46 AM] waltor#3519
and plants


[22-Jul-18 10:46 AM] waltor#3519
Everything will be rotated around to keep soils healthy

youma, of course not


[22-Jul-18 10:47 AM] waltor#3519
massive areas will be turned into arable land


[22-Jul-18 10:47 AM] waltor#3519
We are inherently changing the landscape and environment


[22-Jul-18 10:48 AM] waltor#3519
And once it begins it will continue on going and getting wetter and better for farming


[22-Jul-18 10:48 AM] waltor#3519
Until we have a rainforest practically

Evapotranspiration


[22-Jul-18 10:49 AM] waltor#3519
When we irrigate, some of the water will inevitably leave the plants and rejoin the atmosphere to rain down somewhere else


[22-Jul-18 10:49 AM] waltor#3519

How


[23-Jul-18 09:47 PM] waltor#3519
üê≤


[23-Jul-18 09:47 PM] waltor#3519
So flush the ground with soil, then get rid of the salty water?


[23-Jul-18 09:47 PM] waltor#3519
well


[23-Jul-18 09:48 PM] waltor#3519
Irrigate the ground and pump out the now salty water


[23-Jul-18 09:48 PM] waltor#3519
Ok


[23-Jul-18 09:50 PM] waltor#3519
Wdym by contains a lot of salts


[23-Jul-18 09:50 PM] waltor#3519

[23-Jul-18 09:55 PM] waltor#3519
How do we get water across from the Lake Eyre catchment to the Murray-Darling


[23-Jul-18 09:55 PM] waltor#3519
There isn‚Äôt much of a ridge seperating them and there is a way around


[23-Jul-18 09:55 PM] waltor#3519
Because if the range didn‚Äôt it‚Äôd all drain to lake eyre and do nothing

[23-Jul-18 09:57 PM] waltor#3519
wdym


[23-Jul-18 09:57 PM] waltor#3519
We aren‚Äôt per se pumping

Ah i think i know where you got mixed up


[23-Jul-18 09:58 PM] waltor#3519
Boundar inbetween GoC and LE catchments


[23-Jul-18 09:58 PM] waltor#3519
During the extreme dry season it‚Äôd still be producing in excess of 10,000 cubic metres per second

Murray-darling catchment


[23-Jul-18 09:59 PM] waltor#3519
Not murray river


[23-Jul-18 10:00 PM] waltor#3519
What


[23-Jul-18 10:00 PM] waltor#3519
There‚Äôs a reservoir around the range


[23-Jul-18 10:00 PM] waltor#3519
Big dam


[23-Jul-18 10:01 PM] waltor#3519
wdym


[23-Jul-18 10:01 PM] waltor#3519
It‚Äôs not really via


[23-Jul-18 10:02 PM] waltor#3519
Yeah, but any other way would help


[23-Jul-18 10:02 PM] waltor#3519
since the reservoir surrounds the entire range by 30 or 50km


[23-Jul-18 10:02 PM] waltor#3519
.


[23-Jul-18 10:02 PM] waltor#3519
No i mean other routes


[23-Jul-18 10:02 PM] waltor#3519
Yeah a canal


[23-Jul-18 10:02 PM] waltor#3519
along a naturally good route to the Darling river

if the Carpentarian range is $1t, the Gascoyne will probably be just $200b


[06-Aug-18 06:33 PM] waltor#3519
It'll provide another city, and even more water


[06-Aug-18 06:33 PM] waltor#3519
To flow across the Nullabor and provide shipping all the way out west so ships can head to India and Europe


[06-Aug-18 06:35 PM] waltor#3519
it's the second range to be built


[06-Aug-18 06:36 PM] waltor#3519

[07-Aug-18 06:37 PM] waltor#3519
Is it possible to turn shitty soils


[07-Aug-18 06:37 PM] waltor#3519
like leptosols


[07-Aug-18 06:38 PM] waltor#3519
into good soils for farming?


[07-Aug-18 06:38 PM] waltor#3519
OK how


[07-Aug-18 06:38 PM] waltor#3519
Apparently leptosol is lumpy and is similar to gravel

[08-Aug-18 07:10 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
can we have ricefields instead?

[11-Aug-18 07:05 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
cocaina

[16-Aug-18 06:31 PM] waltor#3519
Why does the monsoon extend so far north into india (link: https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/overlay=total_precipitable_water/orthographic=-255.52,-2.11,653/loc=76.078,21.474)

[16-Aug-18 06:31 PM] waltor#3519
But it does not extend far into Australia despite being on similar latitudes somewhat


[16-Aug-18 06:31 PM] waltor#3519
I think something to do with the fact it's desert, so the humidity probably can't get very far


[16-Aug-18 06:31 PM] waltor#3519
because the TPW through the Sahara is patchy


[16-Aug-18 06:32 PM] waltor#3519
ok


[16-Aug-18 06:32 PM] waltor#3519
so if the carpentarian range makes a giant irrigated area


[16-Aug-18 06:32 PM] waltor#3519
that will make the entire area far more humid


[16-Aug-18 06:32 PM] waltor#3519
and therefor the monsoon will be able to reach further inland


[16-Aug-18 06:33 PM] waltor#3519
Yes


[16-Aug-18 06:33 PM] waltor#3519
yeah


[16-Aug-18 06:33 PM] waltor#3519
So it's kind of stagnant humidity


[16-Aug-18 06:34 PM] waltor#3519
And the carp range will do something similar in the GoC


[16-Aug-18 06:34 PM] waltor#3519
there'll be a big stagnant humid area?


[16-Aug-18 06:34 PM] waltor#3519
hm


[16-Aug-18 06:34 PM] waltor#3519
The top end is pretty much monsoonal


[16-Aug-18 06:35 PM] waltor#3519
the intertropical convergence zone reaches down to Darwin during summer

@RunasSudo Hello


[20-Aug-18 07:00 PM] waltor#3519
I'd like to start trying to draft a bill to set up the legal framework for the Carpentarian Range


[20-Aug-18 07:02 PM] waltor#3519
Hello yes @waltor


[20-Aug-18 07:02 PM] waltor#3519
.


[20-Aug-18 07:02 PM] waltor#3519
@RunasSudo so how would we go about doing this


[20-Aug-18 07:02 PM] RunasSudo#2416
no clue


[20-Aug-18 07:03 PM] waltor#3519
OK


[20-Aug-18 07:03 PM] waltor#3519
Setting up a government owned corporation?


[20-Aug-18 07:03 PM] RunasSudo#2416
look up the acts for the ABC, etc.


[20-Aug-18 07:03 PM] waltor#3519
I mean would it be a good idea


[20-Aug-18 07:04 PM] waltor#3519
Can we have a head of the Mountain Mob Corporation appointed in sim?


[20-Aug-18 07:04 PM] waltor#3519
Or would we need a commission and stuff to have someone as head


[20-Aug-18 07:04 PM] RunasSudo#2416
could do


[20-Aug-18 07:05 PM] waltor#3519
hm


[20-Aug-18 07:05 PM] waltor#3519
but still, can we have parliament appoint a director for the corporation or something


[20-Aug-18 07:05 PM] RunasSudo#2416
yeah if that's what the act says


[20-Aug-18 07:05 PM] waltor#3519
Oh wow


[20-Aug-18 07:06 PM] waltor#3519
What irl Acts could I look at that have that strucutre


[20-Aug-18 07:08 PM] RunasSudo#2416
hmm good question


[20-Aug-18 07:08 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I can't think of any actually


[20-Aug-18 07:08 PM] RunasSudo#2416
but shouldn't be too hard to modify an existing one


[20-Aug-18 07:08 PM] waltor#3519
OK


[20-Aug-18 07:09 PM] waltor#3519
So a corporation will have the full authority to get funds appropriated to it and spend it and buy shit and build the range and stuff


[20-Aug-18 07:09 PM] RunasSudo#2416
should be


[20-Aug-18 07:09 PM] RunasSudo#2416
like the ABC


[20-Aug-18 07:09 PM] waltor#3519
OK


[22-Aug-18 04:21 PM] waltor#3519
OK it is now time to figure out yearly TPW


[22-Aug-18 04:22 PM] waltor#3519
Alice springs avg = 24mm


[22-Aug-18 04:23 PM] waltor#3519
Avg RH = 25%
Avg afternoon temp = 28.8c


[22-Aug-18 04:24 PM] waltor#3519
Avg g/kg water = 6.094


[22-Aug-18 04:24 PM] waltor#3519
TPW (1000hPa-100hPa) = 56mm


[22-Aug-18 04:25 PM] waltor#3519
so over by 2.333


[22-Aug-18 04:25 PM] waltor#3519
TPW = calcTPW / 2.333


[22-Aug-18 04:31 PM] waltor#3519
Mt Isa
avg RH = 27%
avg afternoon temp = 31.9
avg g/kg water = 7.877g
calcTPW = 72mm

[22-Aug-18 04:34 PM] waltor#3519
hm how accurate is this


[22-Aug-18 04:34 PM] waltor#3519
so perth is 18.5

[30-Aug-18 07:41 PM] waltor#3519
Ok so Typhoon Jebi has 950hPa at the eye, and 80mm tpw in the middle


[30-Aug-18 07:43 PM] waltor#3519
Hurricane Mirriam has about 990hPa and 75mm

1000 - 70mm
950 - 75mm
900 - 80mm

[30-Aug-18 08:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Csid


[30-Aug-18 08:06 PM] waltor#3519
Yes


[30-Aug-18 08:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
For the agriculture


[30-Aug-18 08:06 PM] waltor#3519
I have nothing to do that's why I'm doing this


[30-Aug-18 08:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Have you considered doing livestock?


[30-Aug-18 08:06 PM] waltor#3519
Throw me all your questions and problems


[30-Aug-18 08:06 PM] waltor#3519
I guess we could


[30-Aug-18 08:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Like sheep?


[30-Aug-18 08:07 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
can we deport all cane toads to manus island?


[30-Aug-18 08:07 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Because you know our wool is like American cotton


[30-Aug-18 08:07 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
It's the reason for our existence


[30-Aug-18 08:07 PM] waltor#3519
Precipitable water would increase inland vastly, and there'd probably be lots of convection


[30-Aug-18 08:07 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
It's also a significant part of our economy


[30-Aug-18 08:07 PM] waltor#3519
so thunderstorms -> more rain -> the interior will go from red to yellow


[30-Aug-18 08:07 PM] waltor#3519
and you could probably graze on that

[30-Aug-18 08:08 PM] waltor#3519
A lot of the soil is terrible, like leptosols, only fit for forestry


[30-Aug-18 08:08 PM] waltor#3519
But it could probably also be used for grazing


[30-Aug-18 08:08 PM] waltor#3519
@NotGriffonomics am I correct on leptosols being shit


[30-Aug-18 08:08 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Motherfucker let's do sheep


[30-Aug-18 08:08 PM] waltor#3519
If the sheep are down on the nullabor it won't be anywhere near as hot as inland or in the GoC


[30-Aug-18 08:08 PM] waltor#3519
so it'd probably be the best place


[30-Aug-18 08:09 PM] waltor#3519
we could make an artifical rainforest in the GoC


[30-Aug-18 08:09 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Also, that could spawn domestic textiles manufacturing so we can export raw wool as well as processed


[30-Aug-18 08:09 PM] waltor#3519
"Leptosols are unattractive soils for rainfed agriculture because of their inability to hold water,[1] but may sometimes have potential for tree crops or extensive grazing. Leptosols are best kept under forest."


[30-Aug-18 08:09 PM] waltor#3519
ok looks good for grazing


[30-Aug-18 08:09 PM] waltor#3519
and if we have sheep on it they can shit on it


[30-Aug-18 08:09 PM] waltor#3519
and fertilise it


[30-Aug-18 08:10 PM] waltor#3519
leptosol wouldn't be easy tho


[30-Aug-18 08:10 PM] waltor#3519
shallow and gravelly


[30-Aug-18 08:10 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
tobalt


[30-Aug-18 08:10 PM] waltor#3519
you couldn't grow deep crops like uh


[30-Aug-18 08:10 PM] waltor#3519
corn


[30-Aug-18 08:11 PM] waltor#3519
@NotGriffonomics if we get sand, add silt, clay and humus, aerate and hydrate


[30-Aug-18 08:11 PM] waltor#3519
will it be good soil


[30-Aug-18 08:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
@waltor what's the climate like


[30-Aug-18 08:12 PM] waltor#3519
where


[30-Aug-18 08:12 PM] waltor#3519
nullabor?


[30-Aug-18 08:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Cause humidity causes bad shit in sheep


[30-Aug-18 08:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Just anywhere you want to do grazing


[30-Aug-18 08:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Cause you gotta keep humidity in mind


[30-Aug-18 08:13 PM] waltor#3519
ok so ceduna is a coastal town


[30-Aug-18 08:13 PM] waltor#3519
in the eastern nullabor


[30-Aug-18 08:13 PM] waltor#3519
relative humidity year round is around 50%


[30-Aug-18 08:13 PM] waltor#3519
doesnt change too much


[30-Aug-18 08:15 PM] waltor#3519
@ChairmanMeeseeks how much wool does a sheep make


[30-Aug-18 08:15 PM] waltor#3519
and how expensive is the wool


[30-Aug-18 08:15 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Uhhh


[30-Aug-18 08:15 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
go to NZ to investigate


[30-Aug-18 08:15 PM] waltor#3519
yes


[30-Aug-18 08:15 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
50% is too much


[30-Aug-18 08:16 PM] waltor#3519
well further inland it's more like 30% in summer, and 50% in winter


[30-Aug-18 08:16 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
25% for marino


[30-Aug-18 08:16 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
I'm double checking that


[30-Aug-18 08:16 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
But 25% is optimum


[30-Aug-18 08:16 PM] waltor#3519
can you eat merino


[30-Aug-18 08:17 PM] waltor#3519
üçñ


[30-Aug-18 08:17 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Yes

looks like we're grazing merino out in the desert


[30-Aug-18 08:20 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Semi arid works for em


[30-Aug-18 08:28 PM] waltor#3519
100 sheep per km2


[30-Aug-18 08:28 PM] waltor#3519
10kg wool/y


[30-Aug-18 08:30 PM] waltor#3519
10 years of sheep


[30-Aug-18 08:32 PM] waltor#3519
500kg/y food
5000l/y water


[30-Aug-18 08:32 PM] waltor#3519
so 100,000km2 of sheep hm


[30-Aug-18 08:33 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
what do you need me to calculate?


[30-Aug-18 08:33 PM] waltor#3519
5MT of wheat
50GL of water


[30-Aug-18 08:33 PM] waltor#3519
nothing rn


[30-Aug-18 08:33 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you asked me a question earlier tho


[30-Aug-18 08:33 PM] waltor#3519
ok this is entirely doable


[30-Aug-18 08:34 PM] waltor#3519
so 100,000t of merino wool a year


[30-Aug-18 08:34 PM] waltor#3519
$10/kg holy shit


[30-Aug-18 08:35 PM] waltor#3519
aand nevermind


[30-Aug-18 08:35 PM] waltor#3519
only $1b/y


[30-Aug-18 08:36 PM] waltor#3519
and when the sheep have to be **retired** after 10 years it'll only be $1b/y from meat


[30-Aug-18 08:36 PM] waltor#3519
eh it;s a good way to introduce organics to the soil


[30-Aug-18 08:36 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yeah, but thats still pretty good compared to the other shit


[30-Aug-18 08:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and its making use of useless soil


[30-Aug-18 08:37 PM] waltor#3519
hm


[30-Aug-18 08:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like, what would you otherwise use it for?


[30-Aug-18 08:37 PM] waltor#3519
trees


[30-Aug-18 08:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
what type


[30-Aug-18 08:37 PM] waltor#3519
eucalypt


[30-Aug-18 08:37 PM] waltor#3519
i dunno


[30-Aug-18 08:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and what would you do


[30-Aug-18 08:38 PM] waltor#3519
what do you think about planting a rainforest in the GoC coast


[30-Aug-18 08:38 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you are actually insane


[30-Aug-18 08:38 PM] waltor#3519
why not tho


[30-Aug-18 08:38 PM] waltor#3519
the land is pretty mediocre, and we'd get to say we have big rainforest


[30-Aug-18 08:38 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but seriously what would you do


[30-Aug-18 08:38 PM] waltor#3519
i dunno


[30-Aug-18 08:38 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
with the eucalypt


[30-Aug-18 08:38 PM] waltor#3519
mulch it


[30-Aug-18 08:39 PM] waltor#3519
turn it into fertiliser


[30-Aug-18 08:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and sell the mulch


[30-Aug-18 08:39 PM] waltor#3519
extract the oils


[30-Aug-18 08:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
whats the rate?


[30-Aug-18 08:39 PM] waltor#3519
make biofuel


[30-Aug-18 08:39 PM] waltor#3519
i dunno and honestly it'll be such a shit return i'm not even calculating it


[30-Aug-18 08:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yeah so dont do it


[30-Aug-18 08:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
do the sheep


[30-Aug-18 08:40 PM] waltor#3519
What do youu think of a bill that introduces a government owned corporation


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] waltor#3519
that builds the range


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yes


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] waltor#3519
and we appropriate funds to it and get it built


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] waltor#3519
then I resign from the pmship üëÄ and become director


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
dont just do it for carp though


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] waltor#3519
i will build both


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
do it for all megaprojects


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] waltor#3519
hyperidoo


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] waltor#3519
halal snack rail


[30-Aug-18 08:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like the Nationalised Megaproject company


[30-Aug-18 08:42 PM] waltor#3519
Dicky Knee National Supersonic Airline


[30-Aug-18 08:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
with subsidiaries for each megaproject contract


[30-Aug-18 09:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
right


[30-Aug-18 09:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
hold on


[30-Aug-18 09:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
i know this isnt mountain men but still


[30-Aug-18 09:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
by my estimates


[30-Aug-18 09:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and this is EXTREMELY crude


[30-Aug-18 09:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
30 Billion dollars to build a ridiculously massive shipyard in SA


[30-Aug-18 09:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like


[30-Aug-18 09:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
biggest by far in the world


[30-Aug-18 09:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
thats a combination of what i think it would cost to build Newport News AND Norfolk Shipyards combined


[30-Aug-18 09:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
bearing in mind those two are the biggest in the world


[30-Aug-18 09:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like by far


[30-Aug-18 09:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
im legit just putting this here so i can access it later


[30-Aug-18 09:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
also


[30-Aug-18 09:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Ending world poverty. To end extreme poverty worldwide in 20 years, Sachs calculated that the total cost per year would be about $175 billion. This represents less than one percent of the combined income of the richest countries in the world.


[30-Aug-18 09:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
fun fact


[30-Aug-18 09:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
20 years of about 175 bill


[30-Aug-18 09:05 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
would end global poverty

[30-Aug-18 09:37 PM] waltor#3519
@ChairmanMeeseeks massive shipyard on lake eyre


[30-Aug-18 09:37 PM] waltor#3519
After its flooded


[30-Aug-18 09:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
can lake eyre head out to sea?


[30-Aug-18 09:38 PM] waltor#3519
well it will be filled until it‚Äôs around 20m above sea level


[30-Aug-18 09:38 PM] waltor#3519
And that would be enough, with some minor digging, to overflow into the gulf


[30-Aug-18 09:38 PM] waltor#3519
I think


[30-Aug-18 09:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
it needs to overflow by a lot to have ships come through


[30-Aug-18 09:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
also


[30-Aug-18 09:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
thoughts on the manufactory thing


[30-Aug-18 09:40 PM] waltor#3519
Diggy diggy


[30-Aug-18 09:40 PM] waltor#3519
Eh why not


[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but do we do it for space or for electric cars


[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] waltor#3519
We‚Äôll just abolish the government and declare australia 1 massive commune


[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] waltor#3519
Both


[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but we have to specialise


[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
because elons thing is one manufactory just for space


[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
as opposed to hybrid


[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if we hybrid it'll suck ass


[30-Aug-18 09:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
maybe we just do electric cars in carp


[30-Aug-18 09:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and space in the manufactorum


[30-Aug-18 09:42 PM] waltor#3519
Do both


[30-Aug-18 09:42 PM] waltor#3519
Make 2 factories


[30-Aug-18 09:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
actually


[30-Aug-18 09:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
hes only doing it for the lithium ion batteries


[30-Aug-18 09:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and he has two


[30-Aug-18 09:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
at about 5 billion a pop


[30-Aug-18 09:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so we could make like


[30-Aug-18 09:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
4


[30-Aug-18 09:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and have two of em produce electric cars


[30-Aug-18 09:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and the other two produce rockets and shit


[30-Aug-18 09:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but while its not producing rockets


[30-Aug-18 09:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
it can produce f35's or some shit


[30-Aug-18 09:45 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and then maybe like a 15 billion dollar huge factory (like, megagigafactory)


[30-Aug-18 09:45 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and that'll just be so we can build like warp powered ships


[30-Aug-18 09:45 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
speaking of


[30-Aug-18 09:47 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
we should totally build like a whole new complex in carpentaria for csiro to fuck around in


[30-Aug-18 09:47 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
with crazy shit


[30-Aug-18 09:47 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like cold fusion and warp drives


[30-Aug-18 09:47 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and then the manufactorum can legit build fucking warpships


[30-Aug-18 09:47 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and then we'll have a space force


[30-Aug-18 09:49 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
nope


[30-Aug-18 09:49 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
getting too ahead of myself


[30-Aug-18 09:49 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
although, the megagigafactory would be great

[02-Sep-18 11:00 AM] waltor#3519
Wow that's a lot of food


[02-Sep-18 11:01 AM] waltor#3519
It would make our gdp $4706b/y


[02-Sep-18 11:02 AM] waltor#3519
We would be #5 largest gdp by PP according to the IMF


[02-Sep-18 11:06 AM] waltor#3519

for carpentaria and other things


[09-Sep-18 04:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
how much would be a good idea


[09-Sep-18 04:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
cause you remember how we were talking about a national megaprojects company


[09-Sep-18 04:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
earlier up


[09-Sep-18 04:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
how much would be needed to get it started


[09-Sep-18 04:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
@waltor im referring to this, so maybe not a bank but just a general megaprojects company

i wanna build a massive fuckoff laser

[26-Oct-18 09:56 PM] waltor#3519
OK


[26-Oct-18 09:56 PM] waltor#3519
Well if the CSIRO does some nice research and get it up to 99.9% air it'd be nice


[26-Oct-18 09:57 PM] waltor#3519

REINSERT SOMEWHERE ELSE
Eucalyptus trees weight around 400kg at age 6, and can be grown at a density of 50,000 trees per km2. Eucalypt wood is worth around $60 a tonne, so every year, after 6 years, if grown properly, 2 billion tonnes of eucalyptus wood would be grown every year, worth $120 billion.


[27-Oct-18 02:03 PM] waltor#3519
INSERT SOMEWHERE ELSE Irrigated wheat in Australia has good yields of around 8 tonnes per hectare, and has a price of around $200/t. If the 400,000km2 of vertisols was used for wheat production, 320 million tonnes of wheat would be grown annually ‚Äì worth $64 billion.

so this is kinda how i'm doing it


[28-Oct-18 11:34 AM] waltor#3519
there's 2 phases, the carp and gasc


[28-Oct-18 11:34 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the fuck is a gasc


[28-Oct-18 11:34 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and is it edible


[28-Oct-18 11:34 AM] waltor#3519
for each phase, there's an overview, projects and costs in detail, and then potential benefits

Thank you oh runas


[28-Oct-18 11:34 AM] waltor#3519
@ChairmanMeeseeks so what do you think of that format


[28-Oct-18 11:35 AM] waltor#3519
costs are somewhat fixed, but benefits are a bit more fluid depending on the configuration


[28-Oct-18 11:35 AM] waltor#3519
and also costs are for each project, but benefits come from the whole phase


[28-Oct-18 11:36 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
that works


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
id do the various possible benefit outcomes as their own things


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if we do x benefit is y


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if we do a benefit is z


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
or do a ballpark estimate


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
depends on how detailed you want to be


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] waltor#3519
well there'll only really be one benefit outcome since it's a bit of a waste to go through dozens of scenarios with just different crop configs


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you could just simply do your recommendation


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yeah thats fine


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
ok cool


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] waltor#3519
the recommendation comes to the end


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
dont forget the hydro


[28-Oct-18 11:37 AM] waltor#3519
*at the end


[28-Oct-18 11:38 AM] waltor#3519
yeah haven't forgotten


[28-Oct-18 11:38 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and the city costs


[28-Oct-18 11:38 AM] waltor#3519
the carpentarian reservoir gives us $4b/y worth of hydro


[28-Oct-18 11:38 AM] waltor#3519
at $10/mWh


[28-Oct-18 11:38 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yeah but whats the uhh power output


[28-Oct-18 11:38 AM] waltor#3519
a bit


[28-Oct-18 11:38 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like is it the master solution as you hoped


[28-Oct-18 11:39 AM] waltor#3519
monetary benefits will go in the possible outcomes


[28-Oct-18 11:39 AM] waltor#3519
physical benefits i.e. hydro, crop area, will go in the project outline and costs


[28-Oct-18 11:39 AM] waltor#3519
uh not really


[28-Oct-18 11:40 AM] waltor#3519
`Given the year-round average runoff from the Carpentarian Range being 106,000m3/s and the 50m head of the reservoir, around 47gW of hydropower is possible to be made.`

saudi is spending about 705 bil aud


[28-Oct-18 11:49 AM] waltor#3519
well this doesn't even account for the city


[28-Oct-18 11:49 AM] waltor#3519

[28-Oct-18 11:50 AM] waltor#3519
which is mainly why I came here


[28-Oct-18 11:50 AM] waltor#3519
I'd think the city would be phase 3 of the Range


[28-Oct-18 11:52 AM] waltor#3519
@ChairmanMeeseeks do you have any ideas for it


[28-Oct-18 11:53 AM] waltor#3519
i literally have no idea how to calculate anything regarding manufacturing or stuff


[28-Oct-18 11:54 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
umm


[28-Oct-18 11:54 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
nope


[28-Oct-18 11:54 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
not really


[28-Oct-18 11:54 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
i trust your better judgement


[28-Oct-18 11:54 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
dont forget my city pla


[28-Oct-18 11:55 AM] waltor#3519
If the Range had 500m tall ‚Äústoreys‚Äù up to 4000m and used 80% of the potential floor area, the range would have approximately 120,000 square kilometres of inhabitable floor area. If this was settled at medium density ‚Äì around 5000 dwellings per square km, there would be 600 million dwellings. At a reasonable rent of $100 per week per dwelling, this would bring in around $3 trillion annually.

If 2 people live in a dwelling, using 100,000 litres of water and 10,000kWh of electricity annually, 60 cubic kilometres of water and 6000tWh of electricity will be needed. This can be easily supplied by runoff from the Range (only 2000m3/s of water is needed) and a combination of solar and hydroelectric power (around 700gW is needed).
If these 600 million people all worked an average job, earning around $80,000 annually, taxed at 20%, and contributed $50,000 to the GDP, they would produce $9.6 trillion in tax revenue, and $30 trillion to the GDP.


[28-Oct-18 11:55 AM] waltor#3519
i wrote this but have no idea about it


[28-Oct-18 11:57 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
right well


[28-Oct-18 11:57 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
werent you going for 10 million people?


[28-Oct-18 11:58 AM] waltor#3519
uh well we could fit 600 million


[28-Oct-18 11:58 AM] waltor#3519
and considering the impending population boom in africa, we could have mass immigration or something like that

holy shit


[28-Oct-18 12:00 PM] waltor#3519
we *could* fit that much


[28-Oct-18 12:00 PM] waltor#3519
but do we really want to?


[28-Oct-18 12:00 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
no


[28-Oct-18 12:00 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and you have to account for suburban housing


[28-Oct-18 12:00 PM] waltor#3519
i think a better idea is breaking it down into 1000km2 area spaces


[28-Oct-18 12:00 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
it cant all be dense skyscrapers


[28-Oct-18 12:00 PM] waltor#3519
and design from there


[28-Oct-18 12:00 PM] waltor#3519
no like that isn't dense skyscrapers


[28-Oct-18 12:01 PM] waltor#3519
actually it might be hm


[28-Oct-18 12:02 PM] waltor#3519
@ChairmanMeeseeks would you think 1000 people per km2 is sensible?


[28-Oct-18 12:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
umm


[28-Oct-18 12:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
well


[28-Oct-18 12:02 PM] waltor#3519
that's like 1000 m2 per person


[28-Oct-18 12:02 PM] waltor#3519
30x30m area roughly


[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] waltor#3519
probably more than enough


[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
well


[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
on average or at its most dense?


[28-Oct-18 12:03 PM] waltor#3519
on average


[28-Oct-18 12:04 PM] waltor#3519
there'd still be plenty of space


[28-Oct-18 12:04 PM] waltor#3519
and this is assuming we don't build up at all


[28-Oct-18 12:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
i mean yeah that sounds fine


[28-Oct-18 12:04 PM] waltor#3519
how much do houses actually cost to build him


[28-Oct-18 12:04 PM] waltor#3519
hm


[28-Oct-18 12:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
as i said, in order to do roughly 20 mil you want a whole bunch of skyscrapers coupled in with small homes


[28-Oct-18 12:05 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you could also reserve it for manufacturing


[28-Oct-18 12:05 PM] waltor#3519
you could do way more than 20 mil


[28-Oct-18 12:05 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yeah you also need to account for commercial space


[28-Oct-18 12:05 PM] waltor#3519
there's still 6000m of space above that could be used for manufacturing


[28-Oct-18 12:05 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so peoples jobs etc

@Plupsnup OK


[01-Jan-19 11:24 AM] waltor#3519
it is a very ambitious and probably insane plan, but it has turned out half viable


[01-Jan-19 11:24 AM] waltor#3519
We have spent many months looking at things and figuring out if it is viable or not


[01-Jan-19 11:25 AM] Plupsnup#9685
What is it?


[01-Jan-19 11:25 AM] waltor#3519
And shockingly it looks like it will work


[01-Jan-19 11:27 AM] waltor#3519
A mountain range constructed up north (round Mount Isa) produces rainfall


[01-Jan-19 11:27 AM] waltor#3519
This rain is dammed, and sent north or south or whatever direction it's needed


[01-Jan-19 11:27 AM] waltor#3519
Since the range is just about on a catchment boundary

Phase 1 costs $662 billion, creates 1.2 million jobs, adds $910 billion to the GDP, and $121 billion of annual revenue to the government entity that oversees the whole thing (the Mountain Mob Corporation)


[01-Jan-19 11:37 AM] waltor#3519
these are calculated figures, and while they may not be terribly accurate they are far from guesses

How does the Nullabor River work?


[01-Jan-19 02:01 PM] waltor#3519
It flows from the Gascoyne Reservoir to Lake Eyre along a path that naturally flows downhill


[01-Jan-19 02:02 PM] waltor#3519
Some minor works will probably have to be done, but bar that it flows all the way fine


[01-Jan-19 02:23 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Maybe me get large loan from either the  US, EU or China. That can pay for it


[02-Jan-19 11:37 AM] waltor#3519
Unsecured bonds would not have us quite as economically in the shit and anyone could buy them - china, the eu, the us, rich people, working Australians


[02-Jan-19 11:38 AM] waltor#3519
It probably would not work canonically unless a good prospectus was written and there were media releases about interest in the bonds


[02-Jan-19 11:49 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
There's no way anyone has one trillion dollars they can loan


[02-Jan-19 11:50 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
And there's no way you'd wanna loan from China


[02-Jan-19 11:50 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
You know what they do with infrastructure loans


[02-Jan-19 11:50 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Fair point


[02-Jan-19 11:51 AM] waltor#3519
this is why unsecured bonds


[02-Jan-19 11:52 AM] waltor#3519
probably would still fuck us over in every other way if it didnt pay back

*That'd


[02-Jan-19 04:28 PM] waltor#3519
Or they could buy bonds


[02-Jan-19 04:28 PM] Plupsnup#9685
What are bonds? @waltor


[02-Jan-19 04:29 PM] waltor#3519
"Bonds are loans, or IOUs, but you serve as the bank. You loan your money to a company, a city, the government ‚Äì and they promise to pay you back in full, with regular interest payments. A city may sell bonds to raise money to build a bridge, while the federal government issues bonds to finance its spiraling debts."


[02-Jan-19 04:29 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Ok


[02-Jan-19 04:29 PM] Plupsnup#9685
