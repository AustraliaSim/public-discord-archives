HELLO


[21-Jun-19 04:36 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And welcome to the debut of The Inderpendent's programming, and its first ever showing of:

BELLMAN TEARS *blank* APART


[21-Jun-19 04:36 PM] Plupsnup#9685
:yeahok:


[21-Jun-19 04:36 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This week's *blank* is several times failed candidate and yet still a hopeless dreamer, leader of yet another failed party @Plupsnup !


[21-Jun-19 04:36 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Welcome to the show.


[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Hello


[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Thank you for being our first guest Mr Plups


[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Plupsnup#9685
"several times failed" only three


[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes that's several


[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway


[21-Jun-19 04:37 PM] Plupsnup#9685
.


[21-Jun-19 04:38 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You refused my public invitation on twitter, no doubt because you were far to scared to discuss abortion with me. Why is that? And why have you decided to come on now?


[21-Jun-19 04:39 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Because we as men have agreed not to discuss abortion, that should be a discussion between women only


[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, no, that's not any agreement I made, and plainly nonsense. But we did agree not to discuss it, as you are clearly a little bitch and I don't want to be done for animal cruelty being performed live on air. As such I'll stick to cutting you down to size on other issues you are illogically brave enough to take me on with.


[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] Plupsnup#9685
:yeahok:


[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Before we get into the meat and potatoes though, how's your wife?


[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Don't have one?


[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Huh


[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
BIG SHOCKER


[21-Jun-19 04:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway moving on


[21-Jun-19 04:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So Mr Plupsnup, you're rather infamous for being a flip flopper on policy. What say you to these accusations, and why can't you just make up your fucking mind?


[21-Jun-19 04:42 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I have made up my mind


[21-Jun-19 04:43 PM] Plupsnup#9685
You obviously haven't been paying attention recently


[21-Jun-19 04:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh you have? How can we be sure when we've seen this same situation so m any times over?


[21-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Plupsnup#9685
You've seen it once...


[21-Jun-19 04:44 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Point me the times where I've flipflopped


[21-Jun-19 04:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I've heard you defend yourself very near to death over building some stupid fucking mountain range, and now all of a sudden you don't believe that any more... How can we trust any of your policies are your actual beliefs when they change direction more often than a Ford Laser driver on crack and a cocktail of 12 other stimulants and hallucinogenics?


[21-Jun-19 04:45 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I abandoned to MMP because it was to costly, therefore unfeasible


[21-Jun-19 04:45 PM] Plupsnup#9685
It was a pipe dream


[21-Jun-19 04:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes like I told you innumerable times. You're welcome.


[21-Jun-19 04:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Now let's talk about the 30% GST...


[21-Jun-19 04:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So yes, please talk about the 30% GST and why one day it was the best thing since Steve Irwin munching on fairy bread, and now it's nearly as terrible as a murderous fucken sting ray?


[21-Jun-19 04:49 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
'back then,' you say, as if it were before you graduated kindergarten...


[21-Jun-19 04:49 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
NINJA EDITS OH MY FUCK THIS IS LIVE TELEVISION HOWWWWWW


[21-Jun-19 04:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
For context, Mr Plupsnup said "because I was economically illiterate back then, or are you to (yes, to) retarded to understand that?"


[21-Jun-19 04:50 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Or maybe I just didn't understand economics, did you know that capitalism cannot exist without the state to enforce property rights?


[21-Jun-19 04:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes I did


[21-Jun-19 04:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Thank you for that random piece of information


[21-Jun-19 04:51 PM] Plupsnup#9685
You're welcome

{Reactions}
😂 🇷 🇪 

[21-Jun-19 04:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway you claimed earlier there was only one instance where you flip flopped. We're up to two.


[21-Jun-19 04:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Should we continue or shall we move on?


[21-Jun-19 04:53 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I think I'm gonna leave, you're being a bit of an asshole. You just wish you could control the woman's body, but you can't, so you're directing you hate at me.
Goodbye
*Leaves*


[21-Jun-19 04:53 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
MR PLUPSNUP COME BACK


[21-Jun-19 04:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
To be very clear, my audience, I did advertise this programme as one on which I would tear my guest apart. It's clear on Twitter. Mr Plupsnup agreed to appear.


[21-Jun-19 04:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
As such, I cannot interpret this hissy fit as anything other than a grand victory for me.


[21-Jun-19 04:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@Plupsnup I'll give you this chance to return


[21-Jun-19 04:54 PM] Plupsnup#9685
How about we forget about the past and talk current policies?


[21-Jun-19 04:55 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes we can do that, as I just offered.


[21-Jun-19 04:55 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok, now, Mr Plupsnup, you want nukes yeah?


[21-Jun-19 04:55 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Why do you want to bomb China so motherfucken much?


[21-Jun-19 04:55 PM] Plupsnup#9685
No


[21-Jun-19 04:55 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh interesting, I didn't realise you flip flopped on that issue.


[21-Jun-19 04:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Can you elaborate? What is your policy on nukes?


[21-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Point to me in the manifesto where it says I want nukes, my manifesto is public, and I don't want to bomb china


[21-Jun-19 04:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh my bad, but I did just ask you to tell me about your nuclear policy, or did you forget it?


[21-Jun-19 04:57 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I didn't forget it


[21-Jun-19 04:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's all good, the stress of failed elections can take it out of you... I mean I assume, I don't really know myself... *smirks*


[21-Jun-19 04:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ah well could you please share.


[21-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I made Sydney the biggest marginal seat in this country, I wouldn't call that a failure


[21-Jun-19 04:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I suppose that's fair. Now, could you please call me The Honourable BellmanTGM for the rest of this broadcast, and we'll come back to that point at the end of the programme...


[21-Jun-19 04:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway, why are you avoiding telling me about you policy on nuclear armament?


[21-Jun-19 04:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Are you ashamed?


[21-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Plupsnup#9685
No


[21-Jun-19 05:00 PM] Plupsnup#9685
If the people don't trust my words you should read out the policy


[21-Jun-19 05:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I asked you the question...


[21-Jun-19 05:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Did you forget that too?


[21-Jun-19 05:00 PM] Plupsnup#9685
But apparently the people don't trust me so I shouldn't answer


[21-Jun-19 05:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Do you not know the answer?


[21-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I do


[21-Jun-19 05:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I mean it's ok if you don't, I just thought you would since it's, you know, your policy...


[21-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I know the answer


[21-Jun-19 05:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well for the thirtieth time, can you tell me your party's nuclear policy?


[21-Jun-19 05:02 PM] Plupsnup#9685
To investigate if we need nuclear armament in case the US keeps going down its isolationist path


[21-Jun-19 05:02 PM] Plupsnup#9685
That's the policy


[21-Jun-19 05:02 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ahh to investigate... What do you presume would be the result of said investigation?


[21-Jun-19 05:03 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I don't know


[21-Jun-19 05:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's a very concerning proposition, given your history of straight up declaring we need nukes.


[21-Jun-19 05:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Who do you think we need to bomb?


[21-Jun-19 05:03 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Noone atm


[21-Jun-19 05:03 PM] Plupsnup#9685
We aren't in a war


[21-Jun-19 05:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I don't know a Noone Atm


[21-Jun-19 05:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
*laugh track plays*


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
yeah that one was my bad, folks


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well I suppose but if we don't need to bomb anyone, why have bombs? Nuclear bombs of all things?


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Why do you hate the rest of the world?


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Or at least why do you want them to hate us?


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] Plupsnup#9685
It's a deterrent against having war


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
WHy do you hate peace?


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ah yes, nothing deters war more than war weapons.


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Very L O G I C


[21-Jun-19 05:05 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Ah yes, why didn't the USSR invade western Europe in the 60s?


[21-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Have you heard of the M.A.D. doctrine?


[21-Jun-19 05:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
MAD doctrine? Is that what they call your manifesto?


[21-Jun-19 05:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I thought it was just me...


[21-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Plupsnup#9685
What you said makes no sense...


[21-Jun-19 05:06 PM] Plupsnup#9685
But ok


[21-Jun-19 05:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Please continue trying to justify your shit policies, I didn't mean to cut you off, my bad.


[21-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Plupsnup#9685
You're nothing but a bully


[21-Jun-19 05:07 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I'm leaving


[21-Jun-19 05:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I thought that was Bsharri?


[21-Jun-19 05:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
PLUPS COME BACK


[21-Jun-19 05:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Can we at least talk about the Bsharri incident?


[21-Jun-19 05:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@Plupsnup ?


[21-Jun-19 05:09 PM] Plupsnup#9685
No


[21-Jun-19 05:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
.


[21-Jun-19 05:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
uh


[21-Jun-19 05:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hm.


[21-Jun-19 05:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Sorry folks not much of a programme, I guess the gap between myself and Plupsnup was even greater than I thought, I tore him apart so bad there's still time left in the time slot.


[21-Jun-19 05:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed the pilot episode of BELLMATGM TEARS *blank* APART. Is that what I called it? I think so. Yeah. That sounds good. Anyway, see you next time! Since I saved time with that dramatic victory, you may see a second guest before the night is over. But until then, please enjoy BTGMMTV

Well I guess it's kinda technically still the pilot since we're using the gap left by @Plupsnup's premature exit from the programme to air it. Oh well. ROUND 2 BEGINS SOON.

to the next segment of BELLMANTGM TEARS *blank* UP


[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Joining me to be torn apart like a  bad nun's arsehole, is @GenericCereal, the leader of the opposition and never-to-be PM whose firmness on policies is resemblant of a gay man's penis in a lesbian bar.


[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
WELCOME!


[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hm


[21-Jun-19 08:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I guess he got cold feet.


[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Can't blame him.


[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@GenericCereal that was your cue bud.


[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Haha substituting vowels passes for comedy I guess sure


[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
That is an interesting note, political commentators add that one to you parliamentary bios!


[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway thanks for your noble sacrifice and appearing on television today.


[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Now first of all, let's talk about this Bsharri incident. Get it out of the way.


[21-Jun-19 08:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
When did the Liberal party turn into a bunch of snowflakes that can't produce any kind of debate that holds any more substance than just screaming BULLY over and over again like one of those reports on A Current Affair where they get angry at dodgy tradies or fucken centrelink or whoever the fuck they are angry at that day?


[21-Jun-19 08:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I guess I'm just surprised that someone who gets his panties in a twist over being called a 'small man' would have the balls to appear on a show like this.


[21-Jun-19 08:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Sounds like libel, and extremely doubtful, however it would explain some things, yes.


[21-Jun-19 08:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes I heard as much from your wife last night.

😆 (2) 

[21-Jun-19 08:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's a legitimate kink, fuck you


[21-Jun-19 08:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No she fucked me


[21-Jun-19 08:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And from what I hear you haven't fucked her in quite some time


[21-Jun-19 08:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hmmm


[21-Jun-19 08:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway back to the point


[21-Jun-19 08:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes good question I have to think a moment


[21-Jun-19 08:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway, can you explain for the audience exactly what Bsharri did wrong and why we should care so much about it?


[21-Jun-19 08:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No that wasn't the question you dolt


[21-Jun-19 08:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh yeah same


[21-Jun-19 08:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I don't know I just think you seem a bit soft, Bsharri's playing hardball for sure and you blokes in blue can't hack it.


[21-Jun-19 08:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And I fucken hate socialists so it pains me to say it!


[21-Jun-19 08:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok so you're saying it's only ok to bully and blackmail when election timee is on? I guess...


[21-Jun-19 08:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No actually that seems like hypocrisy, although I suppose that's nothing new...


[21-Jun-19 08:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Por que no los dos?


[21-Jun-19 08:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And besides; what would you know about being in government?


[21-Jun-19 08:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes and look at you now...


[21-Jun-19 08:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
rejected by the people


[21-Jun-19 08:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
and your wife


[21-Jun-19 08:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh yes very good government making


[21-Jun-19 08:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway moving on


[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Let's talk PELL


[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Why do you support paedophiles?


[21-Jun-19 08:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hm


[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh so you're saying your party is a shambles and none of you share the same opinions?


[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well it just seems a lot of your positions on things are so-called 'conscience votes' which to just sounds like 'we can't make up our fucken minds'


[21-Jun-19 08:18 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes, of which there are many


[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Sooooo basically you have no fixed policy on the most significant issues facing Australia?


[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well no fucking wonder you can't win an election, you have no policies!


[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
WHo would vote for a party with no poilicies!


[21-Jun-19 08:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But porridge there are many issues


[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And you said so yourself Porridge, social issues are the ones plaguing the nation


[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No Porridge, I most certainly am not. I did not form the LIberal Party.

You haven't really though have you


[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Your party's message was , ' ah yeh fuck just vote however you feel yeah alright that should do it'


[21-Jun-19 08:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Sure I formed the LIb Dems with you


[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But the Lib Dems are no more


[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Although for some reason they have a party constitution


[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
not sure how that works


[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I guess you guys do black magic in the Liberal Party to make things happen


[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh yeah your wife said something about that too


[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Quite the monster


[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway, you haven't really answered the question.


[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Why don't you have any social policies?


[21-Jun-19 08:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Are you too scared to take a stance?


[21-Jun-19 08:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Pleased stop advertising companies we aren't getting paid for. Thank you.


[21-Jun-19 08:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ah so you have one policy.


[21-Jun-19 08:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I suppose that's a start.


[21-Jun-19 08:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
by chance


[21-Jun-19 08:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
that was a conscience vote as well


[21-Jun-19 08:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
There was no party campaigning on that issue


[21-Jun-19 08:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Where were the party statements supporting it?


[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh yes the former Liberal Democrats


[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You've gone senile friend that isn't your party!


[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So not your party?


[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ah yes I'm there


[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But not this one


[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So why did you change the name?


[21-Jun-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Revenge? Spite?


[21-Jun-19 08:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
On a whim?


[21-Jun-19 08:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Speak for yourself!


[21-Jun-19 08:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Do you think its a problem that your voters care so little for your policies and vote merely on a name changed on a whim?


[21-Jun-19 08:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
If that were me I'd be disappointed


[21-Jun-19 08:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hm yes, convenient


[21-Jun-19 08:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think you're as delusional as that boy in your party who thinks Pell's an upstanding citizen


[21-Jun-19 08:28 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I also condemned him and hope he spends life rotting in prison


[21-Jun-19 08:28 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[21-Jun-19 08:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok good, what I like to hear.


[21-Jun-19 08:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok well @NotGriffonomics is a notorious ex-con, and yet he has somehow made it to the High Court. Could you please encourage people to harass him on twitter to get him to appear on the programme?


[21-Jun-19 08:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It could be your party's first real policy!


[21-Jun-19 08:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Excellent.


[21-Jun-19 08:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well on that note, here's your gift for appearing on the programme *hands Porridge a BellmanTGM4Prez shirt*


[21-Jun-19 08:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I expect to see you wearing that on the floor of the House tomorrow, or I will call you out as a bitch on Twitter.


[21-Jun-19 08:34 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes, congratulations on sticking it out until the end, and pretending like we have any kind of definable sex life with me.

[24-Jun-19 12:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Good noon everyone


[24-Jun-19 12:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Earlier today The Independent released an article claiming that prominent crossbench Senator, u/advancedgaming12 intends to defect from the United Democratic Party in favour starting up his own.


[24-Jun-19 12:02 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
We have since reached out to the man and he has agreed to come onto the programme for comment.


[24-Jun-19 12:02 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@Lucifer Morningstar thank you for coming on


[24-Jun-19 12:02 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
First of al, what gives?


[24-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Of course, pleasure to be here


[24-Jun-19 12:05 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I'm simply leaving my current party to create a new one with a colleague. I'd like to correct the assumption that i am in some way dissatisfied with the structure or operation of the UDP, this is false, they were a wonderful party, and I'm glad to have been here


[24-Jun-19 12:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Then why would you leave?


[24-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
There are a couple of reasons


[24-Jun-19 12:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
At the very least it seems like an extremely selfish decision, you've left your soon-to-be-former party out in the cold,


[24-Jun-19 12:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
you've defied the voters that elected you under the pretence that you would be standing under the UDP banner


[24-Jun-19 12:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
so I just don't understand how you can come on here and say "nothing was wrong, they're a great party" and yet fuck everybody around you/


[24-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I wont deny that it is selfish for me to leave my party like this. As for defying the voters i say two things, First, I like to think voters vote for the person who best represents them, not a party label, and if they truly feel betrayed then i won't have a seat come next election. Second i'm certainly not fucking everybody around me. I've discussed this decision, and it has been met well. If me leaving would hurt the party beyond reason, or even if they asked me to stay for a certain event or time frame, i would do it.


[24-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Given that my party has yet to ask any such thing of me, or inform me that me leaving would hurt them, and they have pleasantly responded to my intentions, I would say it's safe to assume i'm not fucking them over


[24-Jun-19 12:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Look, even in a world where voters do vote for the person not the party label, at the very least they vote the person for their policies, and changing parties surely will have that effect. If not, what's the  point in starting a new one? The only explanation I could come up with was that this is a thirst for power, whereby you desire party leadership.


[24-Jun-19 12:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
How can you justify that to voters and your current party?


[24-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Well first, I'm certainly not power hungry. As for justifying it to voters, I have to say, if they voted for my policies, they won't be disappointed, if they voted for party they will be. I also maintain this is a democratic system and if they are truly unhappy about my decision, my time as a senator will be much shorter then i'd like. I feel i've already done fine justifying my decision to my party


[24-Jun-19 12:29 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
( @Lucifer Morningstar I'm back sorry, stepped away for a moment)


[24-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
(It's fine)


[24-Jun-19 12:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well if you say if they voted for your policies, it's fine, does that mean that this party change will not affect the policies you ran under, and have stood with so far?


[24-Jun-19 12:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
If so, then what's the point changing parties?


[24-Jun-19 12:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
If your current party is a happy environment, and if the new party will have the same policies, then what is the point, what could be the point besides power hunger?


[24-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
may i make a statement real quick before i answer that question?


[24-Jun-19 12:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Furthermore, why not wait until your current term ends to change party? Seems the most sensible.


[24-Jun-19 12:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'd rather you answer the question, honestly.

[24-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
First, While policies are not set in stone, and i am still in discussions with other party members on what certain policies will be, there will be some differences, but it will remain similar. It's not power hunger, but i do wish to have a chance to redefine policy closer to my views and the views of those i'm grouping with. As for the second question, i wish to say i don't intend on my seat ever leaving the UDP. I plan to ask the leader of the UDP next time i talk to him about me resigning from my seat before i leave the party, therefore leaving the seat in the hands of the UDP


[24-Jun-19 12:38 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But you said your policies weren't going to change.


[24-Jun-19 12:38 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And until just now kept banging on about leaving your seat earlier than planned under voter mandate, not by resignation. You've just changed your story now.


[24-Jun-19 12:39 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
None of this is adding up, you're caving into pressure from my one interview. Hard to have faith in this endeavour right now I must say.


[24-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
You're right i have changed my story, mainly i'll admit, because the idea hadn't occured to me until this interview

[24-Jun-19 12:39 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You keep denying that it's power hunger, until just now you denied that it was policy, and you keep denying that it's because you are unsatisfied with your party.


[24-Jun-19 12:39 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
None of this makes sense.


[24-Jun-19 12:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh so clearly you've thought this through a lot.


[24-Jun-19 12:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Or not at all.


[24-Jun-19 12:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Can you guarantee to us right now, that if your Australian Democrats go ahead you will resign from your seat?


[24-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Yes'


[24-Jun-19 12:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Fascinating.


[24-Jun-19 12:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
We're sounding a lot more responsible now, but only after my prompting as you yourself admit. Why should voters vote for you when either of these two things are true: you are unable to properly consider the implications or consequences of your actions OR you cave under media pressure in no less than two seconds flat?


[24-Jun-19 12:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Both of these indicate a very unreliable candidate, and certainly not someone I'd want to vote for.


[24-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I'll admit it certainly doesn't look good as to my competency. I can say i have thought this through, although i will admit i did not consider seat inheritance as i should have


[24-Jun-19 12:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hm a self-admitted incompetent candidate ladies and gentlemen, put your faith in him!


[24-Jun-19 12:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Also you still haven't really give a clear answer as to why you would do this


[24-Jun-19 12:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is it policy difference? You've said no.


[24-Jun-19 12:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is it personality clashes? You've said absolutely not.


[24-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I have to say, i'm not sure how admitting that it looks bad for me is me admitting incompetence


[24-Jun-19 12:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is it for power? You've said no.


[24-Jun-19 12:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
What other reason could it be?

Power? No.
Policy? Not really.
Personality? Absolutely not.

I can't give one clear reason because there is no one defining reason.


[24-Jun-19 12:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So yes, it was for shits and giggles?


[24-Jun-19 12:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
A straight up whim?


[24-Jun-19 12:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You cannot give us any logical process as to how you made this significant decision?


[24-Jun-19 12:55 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm asking the most basic questions and you've conceded over and over again that you hadn't even considered the thought before now.


[24-Jun-19 12:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
How useless can you be?


[24-Jun-19 12:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Honestly if I'm the people of South Australia right now, I'm kind of hoping you do end up resigning, because this is looking rather hopeless.


[24-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Well then in that case, the people of South Australia can sleep easy because i keep my word. If this doesn't happen it won't matter and if it does i'll be resigning


[24-Jun-19 12:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I know I asked a bunch of questions there so it was probably hard to follow but I would like some of those answered, so I'll try again:


[24-Jun-19 12:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This idea was decided to be acted upon by you, for no reason whatsoever as you yourself admit, and instead was just done for the hell of it?


[24-Jun-19 12:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

Firs question on this: Where do you suppose the Hexham Bridge is located?


[30-Jun-19 12:19 PM] johndhills13#5249
After my own research on the night, there were many conflicting answers


[30-Jun-19 12:19 PM] johndhills13#5249
I’ve come to the conclusion each end of the bridge is located on a different suburb


[30-Jun-19 12:20 PM] johndhills13#5249
However, I do not believe the bridge is at any point located in kooragang


[30-Jun-19 12:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[30-Jun-19 12:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
HEXHAM Bridge


[30-Jun-19 12:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Crikey people


[30-Jun-19 12:21 PM] johndhills13#5249
Fail to see why you would believe that


[30-Jun-19 12:21 PM] johndhills13#5249
There is no reason to say that aside from the name


[30-Jun-19 12:22 PM] johndhills13#5249
Just because the bridge is name after a local area, doesn’t mean it is in the suburb


[30-Jun-19 12:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
WELL ACTUALLY. I am a local of the area, a fact which your campaign has attributed to meaning a heightened understanding of the place. I was born and raised there.


[30-Jun-19 12:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hexham Bridge is, in fact, in fecking Hexham.


[30-Jun-19 12:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyone on that point though.


[30-Jun-19 12:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
What makes you think that being a local would actually make you a better parliamentarian than someone else?


[30-Jun-19 12:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
A whole bunch of people are from Robertson, is anyone from there a high quality candidate?


[30-Jun-19 12:24 PM] johndhills13#5249
I believe that it gives me a better understanding of what the people in the area want. It might not be the only thing that helps me become a better candidate, it is a single factor, one that Stalin1953 does not have.


[30-Jun-19 12:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Now I want a doctor to operate on my brain, so it's only logical that I select my mother to be the surgeon since, you know, since she birthed me and raised me, she knows me best so obviously is best qualified for the job, even despite her lack of a medical degree.


[30-Jun-19 12:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is this sentence logical to you?


[30-Jun-19 12:31 PM] johndhills13#5249
No, but I believe it is a poor analogy for what my position is on the matter. If you want to debate the merits of my and porridge’s argument, do so, but don’t misrepresent our argument.


[30-Jun-19 12:32 PM] johndhills13#5249
I would argue that your mother, while maybe familiar with you, is not familiar with brain surgery, while a neurosurgeon might be


[30-Jun-19 12:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
WHo said anything about it being an analogy? If you see it that way, well that might be telling.


[30-Jun-19 12:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
WELL perhaps you had a lucky guess, because it is in fact an analogy, but I imagine Psychology majors would have something to say on this 'guess' of yours.


[30-Jun-19 12:34 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway the point is, just because you're familiar with something, that does not make you qualified to perform an important task on or on behalf of said thing.


[30-Jun-19 12:34 PM] johndhills13#5249
No, but it certainly provides an advantage


[30-Jun-19 12:35 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So my mother CAN perform surgery on me?


[30-Jun-19 12:35 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok well let's shift the discussion a bit.


[30-Jun-19 12:36 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Let's say my mother IS an actual qualified brain surgeon. I have the choice between her and a surgeon I have never met before. Which should I choose? Is my mother more qualified just because she birthed me?


[30-Jun-19 12:37 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Or as you've put it, is it an advantage she holds over the other?


[30-Jun-19 12:38 PM] johndhills13#5249
Once again, she doesn’t have a better knowledge of your brain, she has a better knowledge of you. There is no difference aside from your own personal preference in who you should choose.


[30-Jun-19 12:39 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Indeed. I would say it might be an advantage in the sense that I may be more likely to choose her because I know her, but not in advantage in terms of how well she would perform her job compared to the stranger.


[30-Jun-19 12:39 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Would you agree?


[30-Jun-19 12:41 PM] johndhills13#5249
In this particular case yes.


[30-Jun-19 12:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Interesting.


[30-Jun-19 12:41 PM] johndhills13#5249
I agree because the knowledge isn’t a part of the job.


[30-Jun-19 12:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So, basically, you being from Robertson is no major advantage in an objective sense in the realm of politics when compared to stalin[insert number here].


[30-Jun-19 12:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
HOWEVER, as is true from the analogy, it does however give you an electoral advantage. If you are more familiar to the constituents, it's probably more likely that they would elect you.


[30-Jun-19 12:43 PM] johndhills13#5249
No, as politics requires knowledge of what the people want


[30-Jun-19 12:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It doesn't make you a better candidate, but a more likely candidate.


[30-Jun-19 12:44 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well sure, but you can know what people want without being born in the bloody place.


[30-Jun-19 12:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
If I go to Hong Kong, ask for a beer, I'll be served a beer. HoW dId ThE bArMaN kNoW wHaT i WaNt!?!?


[30-Jun-19 12:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Besides, the election process IS the people declaring what they want. The results will say, "we want Socialist," or it will say, "we want Liberal."


[30-Jun-19 12:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So I would say you're just bullshitting your way through your campaign, frankly.


[30-Jun-19 12:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I will give you a hint, though. There is a correct way to frame your heritage as an advantage, but I have yet to see you take this position. So I'd say bullshit is the likely approach you've taken.


[30-Jun-19 12:50 PM] johndhills13#5249
Hardly. I have given many other reasons to choose me as a candidate. Once again, I have given many factors that people should take into account. I don’t believe I am a better candidate than Stalin1953 due to my place of birth alone. There are a range of factors that are part of this important decision. I would hope the citizens consider all of them  I resent being told to use my heritage as an electoral advantage. Heritage shouldn’t make a difference. Knowledge and ability should.


[30-Jun-19 12:52 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Knowledge and ability absolutely should, but whether you went into it this way intentionally or not, it's ended up that your campaign has been about heritage and you've given some hodge podge about how it makes you more qualified because you know the area or some shit.


[30-Jun-19 12:53 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Heritage ABSOLUTELY can make a difference.


[30-Jun-19 12:53 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The difference it makes does NOT affect ability or knowledge, at all really.


[30-Jun-19 12:53 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This is despite the claims you've made leading up to this.


[30-Jun-19 12:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You have not approached this advantage appropriately which to me either indicates deception and an attack on the opposing candidate, OR incompetence.


[30-Jun-19 12:54 PM] johndhills13#5249
I don’t believe it should be about heritage, and I do strongly believe that locals should represent their area. That is the underlying foundation of our form of democracy


[30-Jun-19 12:54 PM] johndhills13#5249
It indicates morality.


[30-Jun-19 12:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Morality?


[30-Jun-19 12:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
What the...


[30-Jun-19 12:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
*sigh*


[30-Jun-19 12:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Morality is not the answer either.


[30-Jun-19 12:55 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Try again.


[30-Jun-19 12:55 PM] johndhills13#5249
Mate is this interview or a quiz show?


[30-Jun-19 12:56 PM] johndhills13#5249
I came here to give an interview but I feel like this is just you trying to tell me how to run my campaign?


[30-Jun-19 12:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well I'm not sure if you're familiar with my programmes but this is usually how they go, so not sure what you're upset about.


[30-Jun-19 12:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I suppose I can be generous and give you the answer if you'd like.


[30-Jun-19 01:00 PM] johndhills13#5249
Go ahead. Let’s see what you think, sir.


[30-Jun-19 01:02 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The advantage is an invested interest in the area, and the passion that that brings you. It isn't an "I know the people" kind of thing. It's that you are genuinely enthusiastic about the place, which would lead you to be more vocal in parliament, thus encouraging you to be a much more active representative. That's the advantage. Anyone can know people. ALl kinds of people have strong political knowledge and ability. But the genuine care for an area is what gives you the advantage, the passion. I saw no mention of this factor in you campaign. Instead, we just got nonsense about, "oh hurr durr the Chinese don't know Australia!"


[30-Jun-19 01:03 PM] johndhills13#5249
Go ahead. Let’s see what you think, sir.


[30-Jun-19 01:03 PM] johndhills13#5249
Go ahead. Let’s see what you think, sir.


[30-Jun-19 01:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
While admittedly the most noise on this point was from your party leader, nevertheless I'd say...


[30-Jun-19 01:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
uh


[30-Jun-19 01:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
John, are you malfunctioning?


[30-Jun-19 01:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
.


[30-Jun-19 01:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway what was I saying?


[30-Jun-19 01:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ah yes, anyway, I'd say your failure to take this approach with the issue shows a legitimate identification with the stance that you actually did take, which reflects poorly on your competence as a potential parliamentarian.


[30-Jun-19 01:07 PM] johndhills13#5249
I’d say that is a huge leap in logic. I will do what is right when in office, and I fail to see how using my heritage is following that. I can and will be competent parliamentarian, and I shouldn’t have to sacrifice my values to do so. I value equality.


[30-Jun-19 01:07 PM] johndhills13#5249
I value honesty


[30-Jun-19 01:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No one said you didn't, you're just changing the subject now.


[30-Jun-19 01:08 PM] johndhills13#5249
And you haven’t?


[30-Jun-19 01:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The point is that you admitted yourself earlier that the stance with which you took initially was false, that is to say, being a born local does not give you any knowledge that cannot be gained by someone born elsewhere, nor does it affect your ability. It does however affect your passion for the area, and poses that advantage, but you never mentioned it in your campaign.


[30-Jun-19 01:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So the reason for your taking that stance seems to merely have been to try and frame stalin as some scary foreigner.


[30-Jun-19 01:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm not saying you are racist, I certainly do not believe that, unlike some of your other critics.


[30-Jun-19 01:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm just trying to point out that your claims which deny the point that I've just made are surely disingenuous.


[30-Jun-19 01:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Either that or your mastery of language was not sufficient to convey what it was you really were saying, and by extension also failed to quell the controversy and debate on the issue.


[30-Jun-19 01:17 PM] johndhills13#5249
I believe that it isn’t a mastery of the intricacies of the English language which make a good representative and a good leader. I think you are clutching at straws to point out minor things wrong with my campaign, rather than evaluating both campaigns as a whole.


[30-Jun-19 01:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I mean surely communicating issues is the major role of a parliamentarian... I'd say admitting that as your flaw is a pretty glaring issue. But perhaps that's just me...


[30-Jun-19 01:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And I by no means reckon this to be a minor thing, it was the most prominent aspect of your campaign!


[30-Jun-19 01:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Whether it was intended to be it certainly has ended up more publicised than any other incident was.


[30-Jun-19 01:20 PM] johndhills13#5249
I never said it was a flaw. I’m saying that you believe it is


[30-Jun-19 01:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It definitely is a flaw.


[30-Jun-19 01:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Whether it's your flaw or not, I won't comment, although you singling that part out, once again, if only I had majored in psychology I might have something more to say on what that means...


[30-Jun-19 01:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway I never set out to evaluate the whole campaign so not sure why you're bringing that up.


[30-Jun-19 01:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm just trying to understand your strategy on this point, because frankly, it seems either or both of a) ill thought out and b) poorly executed.


[30-Jun-19 01:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
If you are elected I would trust you to do your best for the electorate, of course. But that doesn't change the fact that this point of yours is mostly nonsensical and was poorly managed by both you personally and the Liberal party.


[30-Jun-19 01:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Further reinforcing the fact that I, BellmanTGM, is the only competent member of Parliament. You're welcome Australia. Vote BellmanTGM amen.


[30-Jun-19 01:24 PM] johndhills13#5249
While it is your right to believe that I can assure you the majority would disagree. I am sorry, but I am afraid I have to end this interview here due to a prior engagement.


[30-Jun-19 01:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh you can assure me?


[30-Jun-19 01:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well that's reassuring you're well versed in the opinions of the majority of Australia. I mean I guess you were born in Australia, so you know what Australia wants...


[30-Jun-19 01:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
*sigh*


[30-Jun-19 01:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh well.


[30-Jun-19 01:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Bye john


[30-Jun-19 01:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
.


[30-Jun-19 01:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Alright having thrown out the loser I now welcome onto the set @Bevanite and Bennite, the new MP for Robertson!


[30-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Great to be here, Bell. Can I call you Bell?


[30-Jun-19 01:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Uhhh I mean I guess


[30-Jun-19 01:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Just don't call me Shirley.


[30-Jun-19 01:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway first of all congratulations.


[30-Jun-19 01:47 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Thank you. It was a heated and heavily contested race, but we won in the end. It might have not been the result we wanted, but at least it shows that New South Wales still has trust in a Socialist government


[30-Jun-19 01:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
New South Wales? Not Robertson?


[30-Jun-19 01:49 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Definitely Robertson. Not New South Wales. I represented New South Wales in the Senate, however.


[30-Jun-19 01:49 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes, well... hmmm... May john was right, you really don't care all that much for Robertson... 👀


[30-Jun-19 01:50 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
He's wrong. I represented New South Wales in the Senate, and I talked with many Robertson citizens in my term. Just because I misspoke doesn't mean I don't care about Robertson


[30-Jun-19 01:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes still, an inconvenient time to let that slip...


[30-Jun-19 01:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Also please refrain from editing your speech in a live programme! How tf do people keep doing that... black magic...?


[30-Jun-19 01:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway let us move on!


[30-Jun-19 01:52 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So first of all, in your words could you give us an overview of the campaign and perhaps share a thing or two you learned from this result.


[30-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Well, the campaign was beset with a lot of mudslinging back and forth, and also many public spars  over the campaign material that I posted. I can produce photos of them if you want. It obviously wasn't desirable for the Liberals to bring out my prior nationality as a way to win votes, but despite all the controversy, we won. One or two things I learned from this result is that the Liberals will be posing a strong challenge in the next General Election, considering how other parties have more or less faded into obscurity. I also learned about what strategies the Liberals like to use, and that is the 'carpetbagging' argument, which will give me a better chance of dealing with these accusations when I'm up for re-election.


[30-Jun-19 01:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hmm I see, yes it certainly was quite a controversial campaign, to say the least.


[30-Jun-19 01:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well that was just the warm up question, let's get down to it now.


[30-Jun-19 01:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You've been kicked out for not doing your job. Twice. Will you actually do it this time?


[30-Jun-19 01:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I mean you had some really long campaign speeches, but you've more or less done fuck all in parliament.


[30-Jun-19 01:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It seems that you may not actually care all that much for doing your job so long as you get the pay and prestige associated with winning.


[30-Jun-19 02:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
How can you assure us you will actually work for the people of Robertson after failing so dramatically to do so as a Senator?


[30-Jun-19 02:03 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Oh no, that won't happen again. And also, I don't think it's professional to use a profanity in your profession. The reason why I got kicked was because as I explained on the campaign trail, I had to deal with a family member getting brain cancer and I couldn't fully attend to my duties in Parliament. And saying I failed dramatically is a overstatement, and does not take into consideration the fact that I made speeches on various pieces of legislation until my family member was hit with brain cancer. 

And with regards to your question about not caring about my job, maybe you should ask Johndhills13 as to how he cares for the job if he has the guts to attack me on my nationality and call me a conspiracy theorist for saying that some members of his party have made controversial statements in the past.


[30-Jun-19 02:06 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And also you should ask Johndhills13 about how he's caring for his job when he has the guts to say that I don't understand radical Islam and gang violence which has been conducted by Sudanese, but not Muslim or Islamic youth


[30-Jun-19 02:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
There are steps for dealing with such circumstances, namely resigning, rather than being removed under law. Also I appreciate your concern, but since this is my company, my network, and my show, I can swear if i feel it appropriate so that's all g.


[30-Jun-19 02:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway back to the point, the fact is yes, you failed to perform your parliamentary duties. On two occasions. Once, sure, extenuating circumstances, weren't able to go through the proper channels. I might buy that. But TWICE.


[30-Jun-19 02:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Honestly reflects really poorly on you.


[30-Jun-19 02:09 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Is this what politics has become now? Whether someone can do their job based on two booting outs


[30-Jun-19 02:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You were booted out for not doing your job.

{Reactions}
hearhear (2) 

[30-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Do you understand how serious the brain cancer got to my family member?


[30-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I did my job in my first term for a while until I was booted out


[30-Jun-19 02:10 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I did not not do my job


[30-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I did not do my job for the second time I was reappointed


[30-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
But that was after I knew how serious the brain cancer got


[30-Jun-19 02:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm very sorry for your family member and to your family for having to deal with that, but there are steps you take to ensure the people of NSW aren't left unrepresented while you are dealing with that. No one would resent you for resigning. Instead, you left your constituents more or less unrepresented. It's part of the job, you understand that the entire nation is relying on you, it's a shame about your family member's health situation. But really I don't think it's an excuse.


[30-Jun-19 02:11 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I thought I could divide my time between Parliament and caring, but it seems that didn't happen


[30-Jun-19 02:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Certainly not on TWO occasions.


[30-Jun-19 02:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'd accept that if it was once.


[30-Jun-19 02:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But it happened TWO TIMES.


[30-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Tell me, is not doing my job for most of the first term not doing my job


[30-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
If I really did not do my job


[30-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I would not have attended Parliament at all


[30-Jun-19 02:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
uhh I think you phrased that wrong


[30-Jun-19 02:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But the activity laws are there to boot people out who don't do their job


[30-Jun-19 02:13 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Then I believe that law needs to change.


[30-Jun-19 02:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You were elected to do your job for a full term, not to do a bit of the term and then fuck off for a while without warning.

{Reactions}
hearhear 

[30-Jun-19 02:13 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Is this going to be an interview about my booting out?


[30-Jun-19 02:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You have a responsibility to represent your constituents for the term they elect you for.


[30-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Are we going to talk about the future?


[30-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Well can you read my mind


[30-Jun-19 02:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The original question was, how can you guarantee that this will not happen again?


[30-Jun-19 02:15 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
By apologising


[30-Jun-19 02:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is that a guarantee?


[30-Jun-19 02:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is that all you can offer?


[30-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Yes


[30-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And no, that is not all I can offer


[30-Jun-19 02:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well I suppose the people of Robertson have put their faith in you, albeit just barely...


[30-Jun-19 02:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh? What else can you offer as assurance?


[30-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
They voted for me based on my principles, not my absence from the Senate. Many on the campaign trail disagreed with my booting and called for the changing of the activity law


[30-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And are you always that condescending?


[30-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Do you want me to hold a national press conference on ABC News and all mainstream news sources


[30-Jun-19 02:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes I am, that's how my programmes usually go...


[30-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Or get interviewed by every news platform


[30-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
TO show that I won't be absent again


[30-Jun-19 02:18 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
That might be something, although really only time will tell if you can stick to task this time around.


[30-Jun-19 02:18 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Actually it might be for the best that you've been elected to the House, you only have to hang around half as long as a Senate term is.


[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Might be ideal for you!


[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Maybe I should write shorter speeches in debate


[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Man you and your black magic that can edit live programmes! Impressive


[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And spend less time thinking about what to say


[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well so long as you do, in fact, debate, that would probably be acceptable.


[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Always encourage trying new things.


[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And just spit out what I have to say


[30-Jun-19 02:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well you should probably put some thought into it.


[30-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Yes obviously, but long speeches was also a factor as to why I was absent from Senate debates


[30-Jun-19 02:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Not sure why needing to think is an excuse to be entirely inactive...


[30-Jun-19 02:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So basically you just can't time manage? You don't have the time to represent your constituents on every issue?


[30-Jun-19 02:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Fascinating...


[30-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
No that was not what I was saying


[30-Jun-19 02:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well then what is your point?


[30-Jun-19 02:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Look I fail to see how doing a long speech on some issues is an excuse to not even attend votes and debates on other issues.


[30-Jun-19 02:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
They're entirely separate things.


[30-Jun-19 02:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's part of the job.


[30-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Can we move on from this segment


[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Why can everyone else do it but you cannot?


[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
The problem with media now is that they focus so much on the past


[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Then the future


[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well we can't tell the future...


[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
We aren't prophets...


[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And as we know, history prepares us for the past!


[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Nevertheless, I suppose we can move on...


[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well let's talk about your opponent in this election just gone, then.


[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
What are your thoughts on his strategy?


[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Which strategy?


[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
The 'carpetbagging' one


[30-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Or in general


[30-Jun-19 02:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well the carpetbagging one is probably the most interesting but if you have thoughts on other points you're free to share, as per the question...


[30-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Well Johndhills13 did say I was a conspiracy theorist in our public spar


[30-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312

[30-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I also don't know how he doesn't understand the radical Islam is when Islamic extremists misinterpret the Koran and use it in their global jihad


[30-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
He somehow thinks that a fact about a failed economic policy is a conspiracy theory


[30-Jun-19 02:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
stalin are you familiar with the terms "metaphor" or "hyperbole"?


[30-Jun-19 02:34 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Yes


[30-Jun-19 02:34 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Huh. You wouldn't use them to describe john's description of you as a "glorified conspiracy theorist"?


[30-Jun-19 02:34 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Metaphor is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action which is not literally applicable

Yes, correct.


[30-Jun-19 02:35 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Hyperbole is exaggerated statements or claims

[30-Jun-19 02:35 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Y-yes, thank you...


[30-Jun-19 02:35 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
uh


[30-Jun-19 02:36 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway the question was:  You wouldn't use them to describe john's description of you as a "glorified conspiracy theorist"?


[30-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I would use them to describe John's description, but I believe he approached my argument in the wrong manner. Rather than having a debate on it, he just labelled me as a 'conspiracy theorist' and not knowing my things


[30-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And that's not all


[30-Jun-19 02:38 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312

[30-Jun-19 02:38 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, he, uh, he said "glorified conspiracy theorist". He employed, as you agree, hyperbole and metaphor to convey a very simple point, that was, more or less, that he believed you were wrong.


[30-Jun-19 02:38 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
But the truth is, it's true


[30-Jun-19 02:39 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
What are you saying?


[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
The vast majority of Muslims are moderates who suffer more from terrorism and violence than non-Muslims. Ninety-three percent of Muslims do not support extremist views of terrorism.


[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
A Gallup poll showed that


[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok sure but you know that's not what he was talking about when he called you a conspiracy theorist yeah?


[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I know


[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I mean he agreed with that exact point


[30-Jun-19 02:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So I don't know what you're saying.


[30-Jun-19 02:41 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
But the fact that he called me a conspiracy theorist without looking at the facts


[30-Jun-19 02:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Really you're proving his point.


[30-Jun-19 02:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, you entirely missed his point. Go back to what he actually said.


[30-Jun-19 02:42 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Do you really trust someone like that to tell the truth


[30-Jun-19 02:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
He agreed that extremism in religion leads to such things as terrorism, and that such extremists are rarer than moderates.


[30-Jun-19 02:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You're proving his point my guy.


[30-Jun-19 02:42 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Do I need to go through every single misconception about Muslims


[30-Jun-19 02:42 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Tell me where does that extremism come from


[30-Jun-19 02:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
He said you were like a conspiracy theorist to automatically assume that a member of a right-wing party would a) be dishonest and b) overstate religious extremism simply because he identifies as right wing.


[30-Jun-19 02:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Nobody was talking about extremism.


[30-Jun-19 02:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You're rambling like a madman!


[30-Jun-19 02:43 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Well you said it yourself


[30-Jun-19 02:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
john agreed with everything you're saying about extremism.


[30-Jun-19 02:43 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
"He agreed that extremism in religion leads to such things as terrorism, and that such extremists are rarer than moderates.


[30-Jun-19 02:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes he agreed with that, so where is your problem with him?


[30-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
No he didn't


[30-Jun-19 02:44 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
He did. Absolutely.


[30-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
He said that extremists were not people that misunderstood the Islamic faith


[30-Jun-19 02:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[30-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Then how did these Islamic extremists come about


[30-Jun-19 02:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Read this again.


[30-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
You know there is Islamic fundamentalism right


[30-Jun-19 02:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
"Islam is ok. Radicals are not."


[30-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Yes but he didn't say how the radicals came to be


[30-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
He said radicals are not the result of misinterpretation


[30-Jun-19 02:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No but that doesn't really have anything to do with the issue does it.


[30-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
The Liberal Party and Socialist Party will have differing arguments on that


[30-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I think we should just accept that


[30-Jun-19 02:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well he's taken the position that fundamentalism is the root of it, sure...


[30-Jun-19 02:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But you've entirely misunderstood what he's said, assumed he's anti-Islam, and painted him with that brush not unlike you've accused of doing to Muslims.


[30-Jun-19 02:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Which makes you both a hypocrite and, I suppose you could say, kind of like a glorified conspiracy theorist.


[30-Jun-19 02:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oy vey.


[30-Jun-19 02:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway let us move on/


[30-Jun-19 02:48 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Are you a right wing propaganda machine


[30-Jun-19 02:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
HELLO IS THIS MORE HYPOCRISY


[30-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Islamic extremism is extreme interpretations and pursuits of Islamic ideology


[30-Jun-19 02:49 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes ok but we're moving on


[30-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
John said radical Islam is not misinterpretation


[30-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Is extreme interpretations not misinterpretation


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
But let's move on


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Sure but that's really nothing to do with the point I was making, nor does it have anything to do with the conspiracy theorist tag. You're just changing the subject.


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I'm not changing the subject


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You definitely did... but anyway.


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Just because I said something


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Moving right along.


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Doesn't mean that that was my whole point


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Mainstream media likes to take what is said and interpret that


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
They don't like to consider other perspectives


[30-Jun-19 02:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Stop.


[30-Jun-19 02:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok.


[30-Jun-19 02:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Let's talk about the carpetbagging.


[30-Jun-19 02:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So first of all, what is the issue you have with this line of argument?


[30-Jun-19 02:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Explain briefly for the audience.


[30-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I came here to Australia as a Hong Kong citizen


[30-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Already had a desire to participate in politics here


[30-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
So I renounced my Hong Kong citizenship after I got Australian citizenship


[30-Jun-19 02:55 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I then entered the Labor Party


[30-Jun-19 02:55 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Became a Senator


[30-Jun-19 02:55 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
for NSW


[30-Jun-19 02:55 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Robertson


[30-Jun-19 02:55 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
is in NSW


[30-Jun-19 02:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes but NSW is a big place


[30-Jun-19 02:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think it's fair to say you don't have any local ties to Robertson, no?


[30-Jun-19 02:56 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I have local ties to Robertson


[30-Jun-19 02:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I assume you do now live there, though. Had you much to do with Robertson prior to the election?


[30-Jun-19 02:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ah ok I see


[30-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I mean I settled in Robertson when I came here


[30-Jun-19 02:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well yes, in that case, the Liberal party were wrong to label you a carpetbagger.


[30-Jun-19 02:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Why do you suppose they said otherwise?


[30-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Just because of my ethnic race


[30-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I'm Chinese


[30-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
They're European


[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
It suggests they view me as inferior and not knowing anything


[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
But the truth is


[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
No ethnicity is superior or inferior


[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So where were you actually born?


[30-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Australia


[30-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
But then I moved to Hong Kong


[30-Jun-19 03:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh right, but you said that you 'got' your Australian citizenship after coming here... Wouldn't being born here mean you were already a citizen?


[30-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Yes, but my parents decided to move out and renounce citizenship


[30-Jun-19 03:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
They renounced your citizenship?


[30-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Yep


[30-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
No idea


[30-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Why


[30-Jun-19 03:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is that uh... how it works?


[30-Jun-19 03:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well uh... I suppose I'll take your word for it, I'm not looking to start any parliamentary scandals or anything...


[30-Jun-19 03:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Nevertheless, you said that you believe the Liberals took this path to draw attention to your race... what made you think it was a race thing, and not just a misunderstanding about where you were based?


[30-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
They said that because of my race


[30-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I wasn't qualified to represent Robertson


[30-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And that I didn't know anything about Robertson


[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I don't think they said that, no


[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
about your race


[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
They said I wasn't qualified


[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Didn't mention race


[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I agree they were wrong to suggest you know nothing about Robertson, my previous interview with john showed all the issues I had with it.


[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh so now it isn't a race thing?


[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You just said it was.


[30-Jun-19 03:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Which is it?


[30-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
They used it as an argument as to why I'm not qualified


[30-Jun-19 03:07 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
*Suddenly walks off*


[30-Jun-19 03:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Uhhhh


[30-Jun-19 03:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Stalin? Hey man where're you going?


[30-Jun-19 03:08 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Important phone call


[30-Jun-19 03:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Uhhh ok


[30-Jun-19 03:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Will you return?


[30-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Maybe, I'm not sure. I have many missed calls. Probably a lot of calls are congratulating me


[30-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And some are calls from people at my office about the transition period


[30-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
From now until I get sworn in


[30-Jun-19 03:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes no doubt, but you agreed to do the interview, so you should probably do this now and deal with those later.


[30-Jun-19 03:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Fuck me this is your parliamentary career all over again...


[30-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Ok. How about this. Last question


[30-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And I'll do my phone calls later


[30-Jun-19 03:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well, ok...


[30-Jun-19 03:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok so just now you said:

"They said I wasn't qualified. Didn't mention race."

and then you said:

"They used it [race] as an argument as to why I'm not qualified"


[30-Jun-19 03:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
How can that be true if they didn't mention race?


[30-Jun-19 03:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You aren't making any sense, man!


[30-Jun-19 03:13 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Well have I ever made sense in my entire life


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I've always been a person that is subject to misinterpretation


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
.


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
And attacks


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
Never know why


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
But that's politics


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
That doesn't answer the question.


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
At all.


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You contradicted yourself again, you said that you don't make sense, and then blamed people for misinterpreting you.


[30-Jun-19 03:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So do you make sense or do people misinterpret you?


[30-Jun-19 03:15 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I don't make sense


[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I'm sorry


[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
I've got to go


[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well I guess we'll leave it there for now.


[30-Jun-19 03:16 PM] Bevanite and Bennite#4312
The vibration on my phone is annoying


[30-Jun-19 03:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well sure, catch you later, I'll see you at the next Robertson by election! Couldn't be too far away.


[30-Jun-19 03:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Best of luck with the job.


[30-Jun-19 03:18 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Suppose having to leave early is kind of his thing, so can't be too upset.

@NotGriffonomics has confirmed he will appear on BELLMANTGM TEARS *blank* APART n the near future! Great job on the campaign for it guys! Although youse were fucking shit at the BellmanTGM4Prez campaign. I suppose this will do.

Oh wait I forgot


[30-Jun-19 05:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You're a fucking criminal who committed identity fraud


[30-Jun-19 05:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
for electoral gain.


[30-Jun-19 05:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Very classy.


[30-Jun-19 05:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So first question, then: what the fuck possessed you into thinking that that would be a good idea? Did you think you would get away with it?


[30-Jun-19 05:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes fuck the Knights, up Souths.


[30-Jun-19 05:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Avoiding the question. Awesome.


[30-Jun-19 05:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I don't know if you think this is some kind of joke or what, but I really think you owe the people a bit more than sarcasm, you prick.


[30-Jun-19 05:49 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Tell me, how the fuck does someone who is a convicted criminal of, more or less, the highest possible order, end up a FUCKING JUDGE of the High Court? How is that ok? Surely you can see how biazrre it is?


[30-Jun-19 05:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Your experience with the law is extensive, albeit on the wrong side of the bench...


[30-Jun-19 05:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Parliament is fucked, don't give me that. Give me sound logic and reasoning as to why this could ever be considered ok.


[30-Jun-19 05:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Not just 'mummy said so'


[30-Jun-19 05:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
we're bigger than that on this programme


[30-Jun-19 05:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This isn't a joke "your honour"


[30-Jun-19 05:51 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes before being removd for electoral fraud like the scum criminal you are


[30-Jun-19 05:53 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I don't see how that even matters, the irony of you, the most infamous case of parliamentary booting, is now in charge of judging whether parliamentarians qualify to hold their position. It's ridiculous.


[30-Jun-19 05:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
A straight up ex-con is now in the highest legal profession in the country?


[30-Jun-19 05:54 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
With that fact ever present, the other factors are all but moot.


[30-Jun-19 05:55 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Probably but the facts remain.


[30-Jun-19 05:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I demand you show some integrity and resign, effective immediately.


[30-Jun-19 05:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
THE FACTS CANNOT BE REFUTED.


[30-Jun-19 05:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
That is plainly false


[30-Jun-19 05:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Of course I can


[30-Jun-19 05:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This is my show only I make the rules


[30-Jun-19 05:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It isn't a fact


[30-Jun-19 05:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I can refute non-facts


[30-Jun-19 05:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
speaking of non-facts!

@✝ 🇧🇪🇱🇱🇲🇦🇳🇹🇬🇲 | 🇦🇨 ✝ please stop sucking off Bsharri, you flip flop!


[30-Jun-19 05:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This is verbatim something that you tweeted at me just recently


[30-Jun-19 05:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, it was most certainly from the account of High Court Justice Tobycool2001_1


[30-Jun-19 05:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It was swiftly deleted


[30-Jun-19 05:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And Ben Dover has since tweeted the same


[30-Jun-19 05:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
but High Court Justice Tobycool2001_1 tweeted at me:

@✝ 🇧🇪🇱🇱🇲🇦🇳🇹🇬🇲 | 🇦🇨 ✝ please stop sucking off Bsharri, you flip flop!


[30-Jun-19 05:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, you're avoiding the issue. You are lying.


[30-Jun-19 06:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
That's my twitter handle, as you know


[30-Jun-19 06:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
DONT AVOID THE QUESTION


[30-Jun-19 06:00 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Fist of all, can you explain how I have apparently flip flopped?


[30-Jun-19 06:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well that did not answer the question at all.


[30-Jun-19 06:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I am trying to work with you to build abetter nation, be you keep refusing to resign!


[30-Jun-19 06:03 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
HOW have I been a flip flop!


[30-Jun-19 06:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I am trying to work with you but you keep saying NO everytime I ask you to help out the country and resign


[30-Jun-19 06:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But it's no surprise, you've never really respected this country or its people.


[30-Jun-19 06:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No doubt you used black magic to influence them


[30-Jun-19 06:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes just like what you us to edit live programming!


[30-Jun-19 06:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway to answer your question


[30-Jun-19 06:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The will of the people was to appoint said members to Parliament. None of them ran on the basis of 'we will appoint sidewaysamm- I mean tobycool2001_1 to the High Court'.


[30-Jun-19 06:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
As such you can hardly credit your appointment as 'the will of the people' at large


[30-Jun-19 06:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
My eyes are open


[30-Jun-19 06:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And all they can see is your glaring criminal record sir


[30-Jun-19 06:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Because you're a crook!


[30-Jun-19 06:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You have proven that you do not respect the law, nor the Australian people, as such you are unfit to serve in the High Court.


[30-Jun-19 06:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I have not.


[30-Jun-19 06:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Feel free to perform a background check, your honour.


[30-Jun-19 06:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But in your own time.


[30-Jun-19 06:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No I have not.


[30-Jun-19 06:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
...


[30-Jun-19 06:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, it isn't


[30-Jun-19 06:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I have not


[30-Jun-19 06:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I have not


[30-Jun-19 06:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
In fact, I don't drive at all.


[30-Jun-19 06:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No that's just you.


[30-Jun-19 06:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Do the honourable thing and resign.


[30-Jun-19 06:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
ANyway moving on.

@✝ 🇧🇪🇱🇱🇲🇦🇳🇹🇬🇲 | 🇦🇨 ✝ please stop sucking off Bsharri, you flip flop!


[30-Jun-19 06:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
How is this an appropriate thing for a Justice of the High Court to tweet??


[30-Jun-19 06:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Where is the impartiality!?


[30-Jun-19 06:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You're a disgrace!


[30-Jun-19 06:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, it absolutely isn't


[30-Jun-19 06:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The @NotGriffonomics twitter account tweeted this at me


[30-Jun-19 06:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@✝ 🇧🇪🇱🇱🇲🇦🇳🇹🇬🇲 | 🇦🇨 ✝ please stop sucking off Bsharri, you flip flop!


[30-Jun-19 06:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Which is blatantly partial


[30-Jun-19 06:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
As such even now, you have not reformed!


[30-Jun-19 06:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
A clerical error, huh?


[30-Jun-19 06:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You mean like how the registering of SidewaysSammy as you was just a computer fault?


[30-Jun-19 06:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This is all sounding familiar


[30-Jun-19 06:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
When will you give up the life of crime and disrespecting official offices


[30-Jun-19 06:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You apologise??


[30-Jun-19 06:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You think that is sufficient??


[30-Jun-19 06:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You are failing at your job, your history affords us no reason to excuse your current behaviour-


[30-Jun-19 06:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well.


[30-Jun-19 06:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Now we needn't even talk about the tweet. You've accused me of being a so-called flip flop live on air.


[30-Jun-19 06:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
How can you justify this?


[30-Jun-19 06:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This baseless accusation?


[30-Jun-19 06:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, you said "Well you are a flip flop"

It's a baseless accusation


[30-Jun-19 06:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Plainly FAR FROM impartial


[30-Jun-19 06:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You are failing in your office, you are a disgrace to the integrity of the High Court


[30-Jun-19 06:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I have several arguments against you


[30-Jun-19 06:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You're supposedly well vested in legal proceedings, since when is it inappropriate for a case to bring several, all consistent arguments before a court to demonstrate the guilt of a defendant?


[30-Jun-19 06:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's normal right?


[30-Jun-19 06:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I have not flip flopped on any issue.


[30-Jun-19 06:18 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
YOU keep throwing these baseless accusations against me, you have in the past been convictd of heinous crimes and tonight have proven that your attitude of straight out disrespect for this country and its laws and customs has continued to the present.


[30-Jun-19 06:18 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Without evidence? Are you claiming that you are not an ex-con?


[30-Jun-19 06:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, it isn't 'the vibe'.


[30-Jun-19 06:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's the unavoidable fact that you are a convicted criminal.


[30-Jun-19 06:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
YES IT IS A FACT


[30-Jun-19 06:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, it doesn't


[30-Jun-19 06:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Because you come on here, blatantly partial


[30-Jun-19 06:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
disrespecting what your office mandates of you


[30-Jun-19 06:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I didn't you idiot, it's a continuation of "No, it doesn't"


[30-Jun-19 06:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You can hear capitals??? wtf???


[30-Jun-19 06:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[30-Jun-19 06:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's an overwhelming reason


[30-Jun-19 06:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
If I were pulled over on the road by a polic officer, asked to see my license, and I were to reply "don't have one"


[30-Jun-19 06:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
that would not be an excuse for driving. Even if I were to have extensive driving eexperience, even if I knew the road rules back to front, even if I could build a car like fucking Maguyver out of tin cans and string


[30-Jun-19 06:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
None of it would excuse the fact that I do not have a license


[30-Jun-19 06:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Thus, I would not be qualified to drive on Australian roads


[30-Jun-19 06:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
As such, YOU are not qualified to serve in Australian courts, because you have a CRIMINAL RECORD.


[30-Jun-19 06:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
What are you talking about


[30-Jun-19 06:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
We aren't talking summary offences.


[30-Jun-19 06:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Not at all.


[30-Jun-19 06:28 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Don't be a fool, we aren't talking minor offences


[30-Jun-19 06:28 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
We're talking straight up identity fraud.


[30-Jun-19 06:28 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Until recently such an offence would garner a life sentence in prison!

[30-Jun-19 06:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You've tonight on air done as much again/


[30-Jun-19 06:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
How can you say that you are performing your job adequately?


[30-Jun-19 06:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You're failing in the role!


[30-Jun-19 06:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Your disrespect has continued!


[30-Jun-19 06:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I might


[30-Jun-19 06:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Except for the impartial part


[30-Jun-19 06:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
that bit's optional is it?


[30-Jun-19 06:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

Because I align with the conservative values of the Liberal Party of Australia, a party I am proud to represent in the senate!


[12-Jul-19 08:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Huh


[12-Jul-19 08:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Can you explain why you left the Liberal Party?


[12-Jul-19 08:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
CAN YOU!?


[12-Jul-19 08:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
GRIFFO ARE YOU THERE


[12-Jul-19 08:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Already got him stumped

Huh


[12-Jul-19 08:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Not a true fascist you say?


[12-Jul-19 08:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I suppose you prefer the term 'national socialist'?

One of them arty farty types...

National Socialist? No, I am not Bullying Bihari

That  if you were a TRUE fascist, you would have received votes?


[12-Jul-19 08:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
What is a bullying bihari

Very interesting, decor, to say the least...

That photo is clearly doctored and only an idiot would acknowledge that to be a genuine photo

Anyway let's get back to the point


[12-Jul-19 08:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well you say, 'during that time I experienced a period of..." yadda yadda, so on etc.


[12-Jul-19 08:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So basically


[12-Jul-19 08:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You don't know what you actually believe?


[12-Jul-19 08:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh so you were just pretending to be a fascist?


[12-Jul-19 08:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So you're a liar?


[12-Jul-19 08:12 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Griffo can you note some of the policies you held as a pretend fascist that you no longer hold?


[12-Jul-19 08:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Most humans don't tend to lie to the entire nation, and convince a multitude of people to pay for membership to a fake party that they lead


[12-Jul-19 08:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Did you refund your members for their wasted fees?


[12-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
We did not charge fees for membership as all have a right to the political process, which should be allowed without having to pay to be affiliated with a party


[12-Jul-19 08:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Griffo could you please point me towards the public admission and apology for this blatant misdeed, to both your members and voters?


[12-Jul-19 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I did make a public admission on the campaign trail for the seat of Cunningham


[12-Jul-19 08:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is this for political gaming again?


[12-Jul-19 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Obviously not, because if it were I would have won the seat


[12-Jul-19 08:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh so you're saying that your attempts at political gaming are 100% successful?


[12-Jul-19 08:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No wonder the Fake Fascist Conservativ party was so successful!!!


[12-Jul-19 08:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh wait


[12-Jul-19 08:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It really fucking wasn't

How many times have you, Mr Griffo, AussieConservative, won an election?

I have never said that they have worked


[12-Jul-19 08:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You just implied they did

But I didn’t


[12-Jul-19 08:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
"Obviously not [political gaming], because if it were I would have won the seat" is what you said


[12-Jul-19 08:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So you're right, you didn't imply it, you admitted it directly


[12-Jul-19 08:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Declared it very plainly


[12-Jul-19 08:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
That political gaming = victory


[12-Jul-19 08:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But your fake fascist conservatives didn't win


[12-Jul-19 08:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway back to my other question


[12-Jul-19 08:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
How many times have you won an election?


[12-Jul-19 08:21 PM] Deleted User#0000

In year five, I won the election for school captain much to the applause of my fellow students

From years seven through eleven, I was elected to serve the student body on the SRC

I had the intentions to shake up the major parties which succeeded


[12-Jul-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
What policies were different between the Fake Fascist Conservatve Party and the 'real' Conservatives?


[12-Jul-19 08:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh so you shook them up by folding into them? Very crafty, they never would have seen that coming!!

It's nothing like the UAP, because we merged to form an entirely new party, the Liberal Democrats.


[12-Jul-19 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Actually, the policies were tweaked the second time round


[12-Jul-19 08:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Once that was distorted back to the current farce I left.


[12-Jul-19 08:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh how so?


[12-Jul-19 08:28 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And why didn't you answer the question properly the first time I asked?


[12-Jul-19 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, I added a bit more authoritarianism and changed the wording, it’s all about the wording. You see, the Socialists took the Communist Manifesto, changed the wording a bit and boom you have their election policies


[12-Jul-19 08:29 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes but what were the policy changes?


[12-Jul-19 08:29 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Are you seriously saying that a bit of grammar change made one party good and the other despicable?


[12-Jul-19 08:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Perhaps more importantly, what policies are different from the Fake Fascist Griffo and the modern 'Liberal' Griffo?


[12-Jul-19 08:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
I made them more authoritarian, chucked in some national service and a bit of bigotry


[12-Jul-19 08:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Bigotry such as what?


[12-Jul-19 08:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Was that expressed in policy or just general statements like 'fuck the Chinese'

[12-Jul-19 08:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Stopping the boats is fine, but this net zero immigration thing... You'd block a suffering individual from entering the country through legitimate means, al for the sake of 'balance'?


[12-Jul-19 08:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And then lock them up for trying to come illegally?


[12-Jul-19 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000

You left that parrt out, sorry I didn't realise it was obvios


[12-Jul-19 08:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I thought your strategy was to deter them by chaperoning them in and bringing them tea and biscuits upon their arrival.
