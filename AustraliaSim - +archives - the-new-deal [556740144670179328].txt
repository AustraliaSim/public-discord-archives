@LuSing My Religion I never said that the coalition was between us and the UDP, I just said they are clearly lying, even if you aren‚Äôt a SDP

oh look, another meta article


[31-Mar-19 08:57 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
here is another take on the stuff thats been happening for the past few weeks


[31-Mar-19 08:58 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
i've joined this sim in early march of this year


[31-Mar-19 08:58 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
and i could already see the bullshit thats been killing aus sim for the past few months


[31-Mar-19 09:00 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
but i stayed with the sim, hoping that it would get better


[31-Mar-19 09:00 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
it didnt


[31-Mar-19 09:02 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
i joined MUSG (Model USA) a few months before that, and there was people who welcomed me, helped me, even the people from other parties helped and welcomed me


[31-Mar-19 09:04 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
but, with the toxic stuff here, ive wanted to leave this sim multiple times


[31-Mar-19 09:04 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
ive actually joined aussie sim 2 months before march, when i joined and stayed


[31-Mar-19 09:06 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
i left, because, 1, noone helped or welcomed me, and 2, new members dont have much to do before elections


[31-Mar-19 09:06 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
if the musg mods were in charge, loads more bans and kicks would have been done in this sim

Fully simmed is amazing, but i think what keeps australiasim apart from other sims is the hybrid elections.

With the recent polling being revealed to the public, we wondered what if the polling was the actual federal election, and what if the House of Representatives was elected by the D'Hondt Method nationwide.


[16-Apr-19 06:26 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
This was the results


[16-Apr-19 06:26 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
The UDP would have 5 seats.


[16-Apr-19 06:26 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
The Socialists would have 7


[16-Apr-19 06:26 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
The Social Dems would have 3


[16-Apr-19 06:27 PM] OneDarthYear#4804
