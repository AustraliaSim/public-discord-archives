Welcome to The Platform. We're a platform for everyone to speak on except the Auscons. Cause you don't give Fascists platforms.

[17-Mar-19 06:58 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Anyway, recent insider knowledge has revealed Youmaton and the SDP had preferenced UDP higher than the left wing independent in the senatorial election. Will this cause a some distrust between some of the members of the left? It has yet to be seen publicly, but sources say Jean-Marc Ganthier is hurt as he believed Youma and himself had a decent relationship, going so far as to call them their "Friend". Does this mean that the Ex, and likely, current PM puts under the table deals and power play above their friends? Who knows.

In other news, the Liberals copped a major loss this election, being taken over by the Fascist Party of Australia as the major right wing party. It is the opinion of the platform that this is a dangerous trend. Will it continue in an Apathetic Left Wing Government? or will a Centrist Government scream "Both Sides" and also do nothing about it? Or will pants be pulled up and action taken? Again, speculation will lead no where, but we will see.


[17-Mar-19 07:07 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
In concrete news, the centre-left and left dominated this election, proving that the last election was not just a once off but an actual trend in politics. The SDP picked up one more lower house seat while the socialists picked up 2 more lower house seats. The Liberals, as stated before, truly fell behind. And the centre, I don't know, did centrist stuff.

Thats all for today, we leave on a song. The Lowly Carpenter by Mischief Brew, from their album Smash the Windows.

Hello, good evening.


[17-Mar-19 07:48 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Good evening, so what do you think of this absolute backstab coming from the Social Democrats? Repeating History? (Rip Rosa) or an upset?


[17-Mar-19 07:49 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Also, called it.


[17-Mar-19 07:49 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Oh, I expected it to be honest. Like, I got nothing against Youmaton, but they‚Äôre just naive. The UDP will dump them like a piece of a hot trash when they get the chance.


[17-Mar-19 07:50 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Seconded. So, you're part of the opposition! Congrats! Any plans in the foreseeable future?


[17-Mar-19 07:51 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Well, I‚Äôve been making some plans since I knew I would be the MP for Corangamite. We‚Äôve been establishing offices in Geelong, Horsham, Warnambool, Torquay- really across the electorate.


[17-Mar-19 07:53 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Good to hear. As for working with other partys, can you give any hints at who you have eyes on? Or is a solo opposition in store?

Welcome to The Platform's Musical Spotlight!


[22-Mar-19 06:59 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Today we'll be having a look at the underground rap/punk group Ho99o9.


[22-Mar-19 06:59 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Ho99o9 is an American hip hop group founded by theOGM and Eaddy in 2012 in Newark, New Jersey.


[22-Mar-19 07:00 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
They're known for their rabid, hard hitting and jarring music, ranging from rap, to punk, to metal and even electronica.


[22-Mar-19 07:00 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The topics of their songs range wildly, from growing up on the streets, to anti-authoritarian and anti-capitalist.

This, in this humble presenters opinion, is the best album yet.

[22-Mar-19 07:03 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
This song comes with hard hitting lyrics and an even harder baseline. Not their most political work, but a banger all the same. As the first song uploaded to their youtube channel, it sets a good tone for what you're in store for.

[22-Mar-19 07:06 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
War is hell is one of the most political songs Ho99o9 has ever released, their song talking about the US war machine and the general state of affairs in the world. Their video comes with some very disturbing imagery, and has been classified as "Riot Porn" in leftist circles. The group wanted to send a message and boy did it come across.


[22-Mar-19 07:08 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
But it hasn't been all ups.


[22-Mar-19 07:10 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Ho99o9 is knowingly and proudly anti-capitalists. But due to moving to LA and having a new manager, they were roped into a one video contract with Converse, the shoe brand. theOGM and Eaddy have both said they hated doing this video shoot, said it was something they could have done without the sponsorship and regret using such a great song for a video they dislike.


[22-Mar-19 07:10 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

[22-Mar-19 07:11 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The song is one of their most industrial. And flows their style perfectly. But the swearing being censored and the general history makes it not the best, but still and absolute banger.


[22-Mar-19 07:12 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Finally we'll end on a song from their new EP, Cyber Cop [Unauthorized MP3.] This song is my personal favourite on the album, but one of the shortest songs.

Welcome to The Platform's Musical Spotlight!


[23-Mar-19 08:04 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Tonight we'll be looking at the Experimental Folk, Pop and generally strange music of The Deer Hunter.


[23-Mar-19 08:05 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The Dear Hunter is an American progressive rock band originating in Providence, Rhode Island. It began as a side project of Casey Crescenzo when he was a member of The Receiving End of Sirens, before becoming his main band in 2006. The band's sound features a wide variety of instruments and styles.


[23-Mar-19 08:06 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The Deer Hunter's music can have a range of meanings, from pop bangers with little to no meaning, to sombre music about love, to the abusive relationship of one john and a sex worker.


[23-Mar-19 08:08 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The Deer Hunter has released 2 Series of EPs and Albums. One, called the colour spectrum, has songs from the emotional spectrue assigned to an album. For Example, Yellow is Summery Happy songs, Red is Angry Rock type, Black is Focused on Self Hatred.


[23-Mar-19 08:08 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The other series are the "Acts" with a range of musical stylings, from Rock Opera, to Cabaret and acoustic folk.


[23-Mar-19 08:09 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
So lets start with some songs and commentary.


[23-Mar-19 08:10 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We'll start off with one of my favourite albums, Act 3. The song in question is In Cauda Venenum.

[23-Mar-19 08:12 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
In Cauda Venenum is similar to a rock opera, with a range of seemingly clashing styles, coming together to form an interesting story and feel. From fast paced rock, to a sort of slow 50's inspired ending. It also featured in the video game Saints Row 3.


[23-Mar-19 08:15 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

@Eehee has resigned from the SDP and joined the Socialist Party. We'd like to extend a soft invitation for an interview.


[23-Mar-19 11:17 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We welcome @Eehee to The Platform.


[23-Mar-19 11:17 PM] Eehee#6658
Hello to all! Glad to be here.


[23-Mar-19 11:17 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Glad to have you.


[23-Mar-19 11:18 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
So, you've always been to the left of the SDP. What, other than transphobia, caused you to break away?


[23-Mar-19 11:20 PM] Eehee#6658
The UDP has shown itself to be - as entirely in-line with my expectations - power-hungry and demanding. In response to my criticisms of past UDP actions regarding transphobia and the Transgender Day of Remembrance motion, cabinet members demanded aggressively that I retract my comments and silence myself for the sake of unity and co-operation, despite their tone communicating very clearly that they were not interested in co-operation and instead required full compliance and submission to their dogma.


[23-Mar-19 11:21 PM] Eehee#6658
I will not work with demagogues. My participation regarding the coalition was always one coated with hesitance, and it seems my suspicions were right.


[23-Mar-19 11:22 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Fair enough. Now you're part of the Double O, whats the plan going forward?


[23-Mar-19 11:25 PM] Eehee#6658
To remain staunch in my opposition of transphobia and any who might allow its perpetuation, whether in its more blatant forms through physical violence or through its more insidious forms such as denial of hate crimes faced by the community. I will be an outspoken opponent of the SDP-UDP government, and I will speak boldly for the cause of socialism by advocating for workers' rights and equitable opportunities for all.


[23-Mar-19 11:26 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Sounds good to me. On lighter news, how has the welcome been from the Socialists?


[23-Mar-19 11:30 PM] Eehee#6658
As of yet, I have heard little from the Socialists, but I know there are many who will be glad to see me among their ranks. Several within the party have long felt that I should be with them, and have raised the idea with me at multiple points in the past -- to be sure, there is no doubt that the Socialists and I will be comfortable with each-other. And, though I had been in discussions with Socialist Party members about the prospect of me joining the Socialists, I had always felt it inappropriate to join them without first doing my best to see the SDP to success, especially given the SDP's generosity toward me in the past. Unfortunately, with the SDP-UDP government, I felt I could no longer back them in their goals, which had become aligned with reprehensible views held by UDP members.


[23-Mar-19 11:32 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Well one particular member of the Socialists has asked for your resignation. Care to comment?


[23-Mar-19 11:35 PM] Eehee#6658
I have no concerns regarding that, and from my understanding it was rather a suggestion than a request. I do understand their opposition to my switching of parties as an incumbent MP, but I will not throw the seat of Lingiari to the wolves after such a landslide win.


[23-Mar-19 11:37 PM] Eehee#6658
It is to be expected that with such uproarious actions, I should face opposition from all angles in varying extents, but I have prepared for this.


[23-Mar-19 11:37 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Slightly offended by being called a wolf. But let's move on.


[23-Mar-19 11:39 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Last question. Can you give us some insight into the Democratic Coalition? Basket Case, One Sided or Strong and Stable?


[23-Mar-19 11:42 PM] Eehee#6658
One Sided. I have noted that ABC News commentary feels it is accurate to speak along the lines of suggesting that the SDP would rather not work with the UDP, but does so out of necessity. In my short time in government, the UDP was aggressive and demanding, particularly of me but also of the SDP as a whole. It is a shame that the SDP would submit to such pressures. 
Given my first-hand experiences in the cabinet, I can assure anyone in need of assurance that the UDP is fiercely grabbing at power. After all, this entire governmental structure is in their favour and is merely a means to an end.


[23-Mar-19 11:44 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Thanks for coming on Eehee! Have any suggestions for a musical spotlight that isn't lil peep?


[23-Mar-19 11:45 PM] Eehee#6658

Welcome to The Platform's Musical Spotlight!


[03-Apr-19 10:27 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Today we'll be looking at the Dropkick Murphys!


[03-Apr-19 10:28 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Dropkick Murphys are an American Celtic punk band formed in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1996.


[03-Apr-19 10:29 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
They're know for their Socialism and one immensely famous song, overplayed to death, "Shipping up to Boston"


[03-Apr-19 10:30 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The band lead guitarist even got into a scuffle with a man heiling on stage when playing ACDC.


[03-Apr-19 10:30 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We'll be looking at some of their lesser known, yet still amazing songs today!


[03-Apr-19 10:32 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
First up, The Prisoner's song, released in 2013

The song details how Bosses are bad, and joining unions are good, pretty basic stuff, straightforward message and any overall catchy tune.

A song about the importance of friends and family. Sticking together in times of trouble and remembering the good times.


[03-Apr-19 10:40 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Overall the Dropkick Murphys show what it's like to be a unionist in America. It's tough going, you keep the family close, but have fun along the way. Definitely recommend if you're a fan of ACDC or Similar bands.


[03-Apr-19 10:41 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Tune in later of a different musical spotlight and if you have any lesser known bands that you'd like to be featured, send em through!

[17-Apr-19 10:38 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
This my friends. This is America in 2019. Hell this has been America for the last 50 odd years. They can't stop. They're addicted.

Addicted to what? Many things. War, Fear, Rage, Anger, Bloodthirst. America has never been at peace in the time I have been alive. Never. Not once. I'm sure my mother could say the same. But Americ loves war, it's one of the ways it keeps the population in line. "If we don't fight em they'll come for you." This mentality is what causes Americans to cheer at the deaths of children.

I do not think, a young man, aged 17, would take up arms against America, unless he had a reason. Most of the terrorists America fights today were created by America. If you asked every member of a terrorist organisation fighting against the US specifically, I guarantee 70% will say something similar to; "My family member was killed in a NATO airstrike."

Now, I am in no way justifying the actions of terrorists. Absolutely not. But if you do not think America KNOWS that they are creating terrorists, you would be dead wrong.


[17-Apr-19 10:38 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
America needs an enemy.


[17-Apr-19 10:41 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
It NEEDS someone to fight. Because without someone to fight, they'll realise most of the issues they face today are home grown. It is always them and not us. We are infallible they are wrong. The global community needs to learn a lesson from the American war machine. War isn't necessary. War isn't a fact of life. War is hell and it's flames will burn as long as you stoke them. And America is constantly pouring kerosene on the flames.


[17-Apr-19 10:44 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
So I urge the government. No, I demand the government make a statement on this. A condemnation. Anything. Anything at all. But it's not likely going to happen. This government has a trend of ignoring foreign affairs. But, if they do happen to wake up and smell the coffee burning, take a god damn stand.

The Deputy Senate President, in his endless wisdom, through an insane hissy fit in the senate chambers. He then proceeded to burn a large portion of Australian Political records, lucky we had backups. It is currently being investigated by police.


[20-May-19 11:51 AM] High Priest Liam#6655
In my opinion his McCarthy era anti-socialist ravings drove him to the edge and when he realised Australia wouldn't actually collapse who was driven mad with confusion. He specifically screamed my and Eehee's name in his outburst in the chambers, which is strange because I haven't had a seat in 3 terms. Lucky the livestream of the chambers was still going.


[20-May-19 11:53 AM] High Priest Liam#6655
If the Senator is charged, we may have an election to fill his vacant seat . But I'm not too sure about the logistics of the senate. What a great bit of Australian Politics! Surely to go down in history.

Griffo has proceeded to show how disconnected he is with the Youth of Australia. When I questioned one of his fellow party members on twitter about the comments, he had this to say:

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/556753130705125376/580750889103523841/unknown.png


[22-May-19 11:08 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Griffo joined in saying it is "what his best" for the Cunningham electorate. Comparing it to nationalised industry and civil projects, stating that "The only thing is, the infrastructure service lasts for 2 years and is focused on building up construction industry skills for young Australians who have no idea with regards to their career." even though he said he mandatory labour scheme lasts 4 years in his earlier press release.


[22-May-19 11:10 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Jokingly I mentioned "Gap years are illegal under the LDP." to which Griffo, being as out of touch as ever, said this: "Gap years are a waste of time, however this is policy that I have constructed based on what my voters in Cunningham have pointed out to be the issues."


[22-May-19 11:11 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Greens member @droniye‚úåüèº supported the continuation of gap years, saying how important they are for finding ones self and learning of the world. Griffo replied with an even more disconnected  tweet.


[22-May-19 11:11 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
"I have never heard of something of such bizarre substance. Kids who have no idea about the real world who have just left high school aren‚Äôt going to start businesses and aren‚Äôt going to start charities because they have no bloody clue as to what they‚Äôre doing, hence why tertiary education is a thing!"


[22-May-19 11:14 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
It seems Mr Griffo doesn't understand that you have to know what you want to do before going into tertiary education. And that companies based around Gap Years, such as Year13, GVI and Volunteering.org would see a drastic drop in growth. Hell he wants to get rid of these small businesses all together from the looks! After all folks, "Gap years are a waste of time".


[22-May-19 11:15 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

Welcome to The Platform's musical special! We'll be covering a verity of music from a specific less know genre today.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[21-Jun-19 07:45 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The Genre, known as "Folk Punk" is a combination of exactly what is sounds like! Mixing the humble and acoustic base of Folk music with a punk lifestyle and lyrics.


[21-Jun-19 07:50 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
A couple of artists in this genre are "Pat the Bunny" and his various bands, "Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains", "Michael Jordan Touchdown Pass", "Wingnut Dishwashers Union", "Playtime Posse", "Big Swamp Gospel" and, "Ramshackle Glory." Others include Days N Daze and associated acts, Andrew Jackson Jihad and Mischief Brew. Each has their own particular style, ranging from fast and angry, fast and sad, slow and depressed to slaphappy and jovial.


[21-Jun-19 07:51 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We're going to start with some of my favourite songs from Pat the Bunny. Pat The Bunny; born Patrick Schneeweis in 1987, is a retired American musician. He has been the front man of notable folk punk and anarcho-punk groups Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains, Wingnut Dishwashers Union, and Ramshackle Glory. Originally based out of Brattleboro, Vermont, he lived in Tucson, Arizona during the final part of his musical career. His writing often describes topics such as life under capitalism, drug addiction, and the importance of pursuing radical ways of relating socially and economically usually through anarchism and DIY ethic. He retired in 2016.


[21-Jun-19 07:55 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The first song I'd like to share with you if "Fuck Shit Up (Whanana)" which is a song about the DIY ethic I previously mentioned. The cheery and upbeat song is a fan favourite, telling how music by itself won't change the world, but music is merely a motivator in peoples actions and life.

[21-Jun-19 07:58 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The next in our list is 'DIY Orgasms' a song about depression, drugs and alcoholism. The overall message of the song is misconstrued as negative while it is actually a song about the importance of self worth and self motivation. It is an absolute favourite of the genre and has been covered many times.

[21-Jun-19 08:01 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The next song is Your Heart Is A Muscle The Size Of Your Fist. A song about the lives of Pat's friends. The song is a saga of sad lives and even sadder endings, but the overall message of the song, "Your Heart Is A Muscle The Size Of Your Fist, keep on lovin', keep on fighting and hold on, hold on for your life.", is a positive one.

[21-Jun-19 08:02 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Our next artists tonight are Days n Daze. One of my personal favourite bands.


[21-Jun-19 08:03 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Days N' Daze is a band from Houston performing a type of folk punk they have called 'H-Town Thrashgrass'. Promoting a strong DIY ethic, Days N' Daze independently records, produces, and promotes all their own music. Song themes range from anarchism and environmental issues to anxiety, alcoholism, and parties. They are known for their energetic live shows. Days N' Daze have toured extensively in the US/Canada, have been to Europe twice in 2016 and 2018, playing anything from house shows to festivals, playing alongside the likes of Leftover Crack and Weezer


[21-Jun-19 08:07 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The first song of theirs we'll be covering is "Call in the Coroner". A fast song about depression and anxiety. The music video accompanying the song is of the band tearing up an abandoned building, letting out their rage, ignoring the injuries they cause themselves as they go. The band ends up sweating, covered in their own blood and with their rage gone, they know with clarity what they need to do.

[21-Jun-19 08:09 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The second song is "Shooting up and breaking down." This song is about the life of a recovering heroine and alcohol addict. Most of the song is depressing lyrics, but shows that the person who it is written about, has some light in their life. The video is filmed by the Band's Leader singer, Jesse and his sister at the grand canyon. Chad Hates George is an offshoot band with many of the same members.

[21-Jun-19 08:12 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
In the next song the narrator is conveying that despite the troubles in life that they will always have their friends and family and appreciates what the friends and family have done for him. And that he feels the wild time of his life is coming to the end, and that his friends lack the foresight he does about the future. The video is quaint showing and empty venue in reflection of an filled show.

To wrap up the show, we'll be sharing a song each for Andrew Jackson Jihad and Mischief Brew.


[21-Jun-19 08:14 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
First up, People II from Andrew Jackson Jihad. AJJ is known for their nihilistic and confused style. Showing the worst of the world through music and just how confusing life can truly be.


[21-Jun-19 08:15 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
People II is the definition of this, with nihilistic lyrics about life, bipolar disorder, manic depression and the horrible person inside us all.

[21-Jun-19 08:17 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
And finally we have Mischief Brew. Mischief Brew was an American band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which played DIY anarcho-punk music, incorporating a variety of styles including American folk, swing, and Gypsy-punk.

It was started by Erik Petersen as a solo project, but eventually grew into a band. Petersen drew inspiration from the protest movements of the 1960s, "the idea that rebellion in music didn't originate in punk rock" (Profane Existence No. 54, 2007), and anti-establishment artists like Woody Guthrie and Crass. Petersen's lyrics often pay homage to American labour radicalism of the early 20th century.


[21-Jun-19 08:21 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The song we will covering is "The Lowly Carpenter" which, in the opinion of this presenter, truly captures the spirit of union music of the past. It details the life of a carpenter, apathetic to life and thinking of how low he is on his own. The thought of unionising crosses his mind, but quickly puts it aside due to the idea they are weak. Changing from a raring song about how much they can do, to turning back to complacency to the point where he forgets about the wellbeing of his fellow worker.

[21-Jun-19 08:24 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
And that my friends, brings us to the end of our special of folk punk. Combining Unionism, Anarchism, Absurdism and Self Love into an eclectic genre, a genre truly rooted in the younger generations of the left wing, with even the like of Mischief Brew garnering support of the old guard. If this is your music or not, you simply cannot deny the impact this genre has had on a broken youth. The detailing of a cruel and hard world, where everything isn't fair, but simultaneously telling of your power as a person to overcome hardship.


[21-Jun-19 08:24 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

Welcome to The Platform's musical show.


[01-Jul-19 08:04 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Today we're looking at the Artist... Tom Waits!


[01-Jul-19 08:06 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Thomas Alan Waits, born December 7, 1949 is an American singer, songwriter, musician, composer, and actor. His music is characterized by his distinctive deep, gravelly voice and lyrics focusing on the underside of society. During the 1970s, he worked primarily in jazz, but since the 1980s his music has reflected greater influence from blues, vaudeville, and experimental genres.


[01-Jul-19 08:07 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
In 2011, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was included among the 2010 list of Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Singers, as well as the 2015 Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.


[01-Jul-19 08:13 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
First up, we'll look at Lucinda. "Lucinda" I think it is a pretty straightforward story, told by a man (William The Pleaser), who is about to be hung for some crime or a series of crimes. He seems to be intent on blaming his fate on the beautiful temptress, "Lucinda", that much seems clear. There is a line, "I heard someone pull the trigger" the meaning of this verse, (and the whole song really) is somewhat ambiguous, but it seems not unreasonable to think, maybe he shot Lucinda, or maybe he shot someone else, "for" Lucinda ,another lover, someone he was jealous about, or maybe someone who she considered an enemy, who she wanted out of the way

[01-Jul-19 08:17 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
After that, we have, not a song. 'What's he building?' This dramatic monologue from a nosy neighbor is set to a palette of eerie sound effects ‚Äì subdued metallic clangs, low-rent electronic flutters ‚Äì that would be the envy of any haunted house designer. Always a creepy dude (not for nothing did Francis Ford Coppola cast him as the bug-gobbling Renfield in his take on Dracula), Tom Waits wheezes here like he's shining a flashlight underneath his chin to spook an edgy campfire scout troop. In fact, they way he repeatedly intones, "What's he building in there?" ‚Äì emphasizing the word "building" each time with a worried compulsion ‚Äì eventually makes the narrator sound far more suspicious than the eccentric loner he's spying on. At least until the unsettling coda, where we hear the whistling from the home of the eccentric builder for ourselves.

Today we're looking at the Artist... Kasbaian!


[30-Jul-19 07:48 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Kasabian are an English rock band formed in Leicester in 1997. The band's original members were vocalist Tom Meighan, guitarist and vocalist Sergio Pizzorno, guitarist Chris Karloff, and bassist Chris Edwards. The band's line-up was completed by drummer Ian Matthews in 2004 after a string of session drummers. Karloff left the band in 2006 and founded a new band called Black Onassis. Jay Mehler joined as touring lead guitarist in 2006. Mehler left the band for Liam Gallagher's Beady Eye in 2013, to be replaced by Tim Carter. In 2010 and 2014, Kasabian won the Q Awards for "Best Act in the World Today", while they were also named "Best Live Act" at the 2014 Q Awards and the 2007 and 2018 NME Awards. The band's music is often described as "indie rock", but Pizzorno has said he "hates indie bands" and does not feel Kasabian fit into that category.


[30-Jul-19 07:49 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We'll be looking at 3 songs by the band, and my personal favourites.


[30-Jul-19 07:50 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
First Up, Underdog. "Underdog" is the third single released from the album West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum. It peaked at #32 in the UK Singles Chart on the week after the album's release. Despite this it became a widely popular song.

[30-Jul-19 07:52 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Next up, Ill Ray (The King). The opening track of Crying Out Loud, this is is a call to arms. Guitarist and chief songwriter Serge Pizzorno told NME: "It's a pure call-out tune. It's got the line 'What's your band called, mate?' It came from my best pal and every time I played him a new song I'd just whisper in his ear, 'What's your band called, mate?' It always made us laugh so I just wanted to use that. It's so ridiculously cocky, and it would make a great T-shirt as well."

[18-Aug-19 06:53 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes are an English punk rock band formed in 2015 by former Gallows and Pure Love frontman Frank Carter. They released one EP in May 2015 called Rotten, and launched their debut album Blossom via Kobalt Label Services in August 2015. They revealed their second studio album, entitled Modern Ruin, on 28 September 2016, which was released in January 2017 via International Death Cult. The album was produced by Thomas Mitchener at the Studio Broadfields in Watford.

[18-Aug-19 07:02 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Frank Carter is an amazing band, with amazing tracks and little to no coverage. Its in my opinion they deserve a spot at the big time next to the likes of pop musicians topping the charts.


[18-Aug-19 07:02 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
And they're touring in january!


[18-Aug-19 07:02 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
So go out and buy those tickets.

Welcome to the Platform's Musical Spotlight!


[23-Aug-19 09:56 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Today we'll be taking a look at: Man Man


[23-Aug-19 09:57 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Man Man is an experimental pop band from Philadelphia and now based in Los Angeles. Their multi-instrumental style is centered on the piano playing of lead singer, songwriter, and lyricist Honus Honus (Ryan Kattner). On recordings, Honus usually plays piano but during the live shows he uses a Rhodes Piano or a Nord Electro 3. He is accompanied by an energetic group of multi-instrumentalist musicians and vocalists. Instruments played by the band include clavinet, Moog Little Phatty, sousaphone, saxophone, trumpet, French horn, flute, bass clarinet, drum set, euphonium, Fender Jazz Bass, Danelectro baritone guitar, xylophone, marimba, melodica and various percussive instruments including pots and pans, toy noisemakers, Chinese funeral horns, spoons, smashing plates, and fireworks.


[23-Aug-19 09:58 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
First Up: Poor Jackie


[23-Aug-19 10:00 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
This song is about a serial killer named Jackie, a philosophical run from the cops. A victim of abuse, she sees men as objects of violence and lust.

Next up: Whalebones


[23-Aug-19 10:06 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
A song about a melancholy relationship. About a man who loves a woman he cannot hold on to, about the only light in his life. About a woman who knows this man who's mental health will break her, even though she loves him.

Lastly: Feathers


[23-Aug-19 10:13 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
A song about a mentally abusive relationship. The subject of the lyrics believes that she was meant to be something greater, but in fearing that she‚Äôll never reach what she was meant to be, throws away her opportunities to turn life around.

Pop music ugh


[26-Aug-19 08:47 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
80s pop is tight.


[26-Aug-19 08:48 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

[26-Aug-19 09:02 PM] woofy#0639
Very interesting I do say myself


[26-Aug-19 09:02 PM] woofy#0639
I find odd that 80's Pop would be the most popular genre in today's modern world in comparison to modern music today.


[26-Aug-19 09:07 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
80's pop is pretty rad. I've notice in recent years people hold a nostalgia for the 80s, even those who didn't actually live in the era.


[26-Aug-19 09:20 PM] woofy#0639
Yes that js also very interesting, but weird for people of thos era to enjoy


[26-Aug-19 09:24 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Thanks for your input. What are you favourite genres to listen to?


[26-Aug-19 09:34 PM] woofy#0639
I like the classical musics, particularly Bach, Mozart, Etc


[26-Aug-19 09:37 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

[31-Aug-19 03:29 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Today we'll be looking at: Stromae


[31-Aug-19 03:30 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Paul Van Haver, better known by his stage name Stromae, is a Belgian musician, rapper, singer and songwriter. He established himself in both the hip hop and electronic music genres. Stromae came to wide public attention in 2009 with his song "Alors on danse", which became a number one in several European countries. In 2013, his second album Racine carr√©e was a commercial success, selling 2 million copies in France alone and nearly 600,000 units elsewhere. He has sold over 8.5 million records worldwide. His music is primarily sung in French.

[31-Aug-19 03:34 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
A song about being done with life. A man sings about his time in a dead end job and an uninteresting life. This finally ends with the chorus, simply stating "Alors on danse" or, "So we dance"


[31-Aug-19 03:35 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Next Up: quand c'est ?


[31-Aug-19 03:36 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
In this song, Stromae is talking about cancer, who he knows well since it first attacked his mother (breast cancer) and then his father (lung cancer). There is also personification: ‚Äúyou tried to get my mother,‚Äù ‚Äúyou started with her ‚Äã‚Äãbreasts.‚Äù Stromae presents cancer as a kind of serial rapist.

The song is an adaptation of the air L'amour est un oiseau rebelle (Love is a rebellious bird), from the opera Carmen from French composer Georges Bizet. The song addresses the theme of alienation through social networks, whose logo is a blue bird, symbol representing the social network Twitter.

By the year 2056, an epidemic of organ failures has devastated the planet. The megacorporation GeneCo provides organ transplants on a payment plan. Clients who default on payments are hunted down by Repo Men: skilled assassins contracted by GeneCo to repossess organs, usually killing the clients in the process. Zydrate is the drug that numbs the pain.

A story of mistrust and fear.


[01-Sep-19 09:08 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Tamara is continually wooed by the Scorpion, and follows him into a dark tent where a knife-throwing wheel has been set up. There she walks in on the Scorpion and the Painted Doll kissing. The Scorpion accuses Tamara of not trusting him, which she denies. He straps her to his knife-throwing wheel, and tosses three knives at her, all of them missing. He brandishes a fourth knife, a switch blade, and throws it directly into Tamara's heart, killing her.
