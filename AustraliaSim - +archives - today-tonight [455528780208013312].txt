Will you attempt to fix this NBN scandal, which has caused so many rural citizens to lose internet?

I recently came across a report, that 1/3 of Australians, wanted to switch back to their old cables, because it was **FASTER, MORE RELIABLE AND HAD LESS DROPOUTS** then the NBN

[11-Jun-18 10:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
What does the panelist think of the recent defection from the Liberal party by Woof, and given the blacklash caused by Matt Monti when he did a similar action can we assume a similar reaction will come out from the Liberal party?


[11-Jun-18 11:00 AM] Ash#8178

Money is assigned in the budget from the billions the government has to give to building renewable power plants.


[11-Jun-18 06:34 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
For example, wave power and wind power.

Unfortunately as per the constitution, I don't have the power to sack Justices. I can only go so far as to discipline.

Now, I want to make this very clear. **I will not be working with him on the bench.** 

Very shortly I will be writing an open letter to Mr Rommel calling on his resignation. If he refuses, I will call on the parliament to hold a vote on his dismissal. If this fails I will resign.

[11-Jun-18 09:23 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I regret the way I named Justices Slothsworth and BloodyChrome. They are not to blame here. They were given very little choice when faced with the touch decision of having to choose one colleague over another - the man who wrote the CoC and knows it inside out? Or the man struggling to cope with false accusations. The justices had very little choice and I respect their professionalism.


[11-Jun-18 09:23 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529

As I said. I will call for his resignation, and if he refuses, I will ask the parliament to dismiss him. If this vote fails I will resign.


[11-Jun-18 09:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Dicky what happens if your plan backfires, when you resign, that Rommel is appointed Chief Justice?


[11-Jun-18 09:42 PM] _slothsworth#4496
No, I don't believe he would be.


[11-Jun-18 09:42 PM] _slothsworth#4496
Bloody Chrome has been a Justice far longer, and he would be the only one of us capable of holding the CJ role, after Dicky of course.


[11-Jun-18 09:43 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Then the parliament would have made its choice. But I say one thing to that Slothsworth, God help Bloodychrome. God help him if he becomes CJ because guess who's next on Rommel's list.

[11-Jun-18 09:45 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I can say that I have already asked the cabinet to consider appointing me as head of the Australiasim Law Reform Commission. 

If appointed (and even if not) I will be completely overhauling our courts system, since the CoC has failed.


[11-Jun-18 09:45 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I want to:

1. Repeal the CoC
2. Introduce a Criminal Code
3. Shift offences from being prosecuted in a civil manner, to be prosucuted by the crown acting on complaints
4. Change the court system from an inquisitorial to adversarial (allow representatives, random juries instead of justices probing defendants)
5. Establish an appeals system
6. Establish a Civil Disputes Act.

Sounds great and will sure be popular

I think it will be a fairer system that will bring us back in line with a Western justice system.

Yes, but in small servers such as these, they can be biased.


[11-Jun-18 09:47 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Well I intend to have an appeal system where the case will be heard by the bench. And of course, accused persons may chose to have their cases heard by judge-alone, just as in irl.

Member for Chisholm, Woof332 will be introducing a private members bill on a future date to make our schools safer, Schools across the country have been recently targetted by the drug epidemic and the growing violence in these schools, it therefore essential that this private members bill be affirmed by parliament, this bill will allow for harsher penalties for students who bring weaponry or drugs onto school grounds liable to detention in Juvenile Facilities or be sent to Behaviour School. It will also result in the student being immediatly expelled from said school and banned from the Public School System (with the exception of behaviour schools and schooling in juvenile detention) for a minium period of 6 months to a maxmium period of 3 years. This bill will only apply to state run schools.

Why did you take this break from the Sim?


[23-Jun-18 08:13 PM] waltor#3519
(IRL had a bunch of shit on) Spending so much time actively in politics took a considerable toll on my health with frequent bouts of diarrhea and stress, and after the caving in of the Pirates I decided there was no point in damaging my health any further.


[23-Jun-18 08:14 PM] waltor#3519
I took a long holiday to wind down and I think I'm better again.


[23-Jun-18 08:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now that you have returned, what are your plans?


[23-Jun-18 08:14 PM] waltor#3519
Remaining unaffiliated, potentially becoming a clerk and serving Australia in a non-political role, or perhaps even looking at joining the bench.


[23-Jun-18 08:15 PM] waltor#3519
I will not be joining a party for a very long time.

If you were tp return to politics, would you consider bringing back the Pirates?


[23-Jun-18 08:16 PM] waltor#3519
If I were to return to politics I would probably remain as an independent and not reform the Pirates. Leading a party as leader and officer was a bit too much work for me, and I think as an indie I can represent the people far better.

Champagne would not cost $3000 if the bourgeoisie did not extract so much surplus value from it, and would be available to all under socialism.

The new airport rules are dangerous
I WAS at Sydney airport early this morning and I got chatting to a bloke from Mt Druitt. He was a lovely fella, but had a lot on his mind, and not just airport security. With a sick relative in Canada, he had a long, anxious and uncertain journey ahead of him.
