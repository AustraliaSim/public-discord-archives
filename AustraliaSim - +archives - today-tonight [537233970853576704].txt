Now moving onto Global Politics.


[22-Jan-19 10:15 PM] woofy#0639
The US Govt is still in a shutdown over the border wall issue, with President Trump yesterday providing a compromise deal.


[22-Jan-19 10:16 PM] woofy#0639
The deal would of included extended protections for DREAMERS, new immigration judges among other things.


[22-Jan-19 10:16 PM] woofy#0639
But this deal was swiftly shot down by Speaker Pelosi before it was even released.


[22-Jan-19 10:16 PM] woofy#0639
The Govt is still in gridlocks with no end in sight. This has been the longest shur down in US History.


[22-Jan-19 10:17 PM] woofy#0639
The State of the Union being held is also in doubt, with experts saying that President Trump may need to resort to writing a letter to Congress instead, the old fashioned way, if the shutdown continues.

Anyhoo, Senator Ash, in recent light of the Government's tardiness, the mergining of the Radical Party into the Soc Dems and the creation of the Regional Victoria Party by Senator AMN, do you think thr Left Coalition is currently stable and competent enough to actually govern?


[22-Jan-19 10:30 PM] Ash#8178
We will decide depending on how the government deals with this issue in the coming days.


[22-Jan-19 10:30 PM] Ash#8178
I can‚Äôt make a judgment as of now


[22-Jan-19 10:31 PM] woofy#0639
Senator Ash, I find it odd that it has been quite a long period since Senator Melbourne left the Radical Party and retired from politics, but yet the Government has still not replaced him yet, what do you make of that?

[22-Jan-19 10:36 PM] woofy#0639
Senator, are you implying I joked about genocide?


[22-Jan-19 10:36 PM] Ash#8178
No

News: Senator Crusher said on twitter today  and we are quoting "Members use it like WhatsApp because the Liberals are hip!" in response to claims that the Liberal Party uses discord. Yet again, this proves the Liberal Party has gone insane at their attempts to appeal the youth, who honestly do not support the authoritarian, statist ideology that the Liberals follow.

BREAKING NEWS: There are unconfirmed reports coming from Venezuela that President Maduro has declared martial law, and the army has taken control of the streets. We are still working to verify these reports, but all foreign correspondents in Venezuela have been deported or shot.

[27-Jan-19 05:12 PM] woofy#0639
Welcome


[27-Jan-19 05:12 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Hello!


[27-Jan-19 05:13 PM] woofy#0639
Now, you were in the Radical Party, left that made a new party with totally different and opposite views of the radical party and left the left coalition, my question is why?


[27-Jan-19 05:14 PM] woofy#0639
(  @AnswerMeNow2 )


[27-Jan-19 05:15 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Well, I've been down in the regions, in Gippsland, in Ballarat, in Wangaratta, speaking with my constituents, and it moved me, honestly. My views changed.


[27-Jan-19 05:16 PM] woofy#0639
With your new views, does that mean in the future you might form a coalition with parties of similar ideologies, such as Liberty Reform or the UAP?


[27-Jan-19 05:17 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The RVA is open to working with all sides of politics, including the United Australia Party and Liberty Reform.


[27-Jan-19 05:18 PM] woofy#0639
How will you gain votes in areas that are generally more conservative and would not support some of the Libertarian ideals you may not hold?


[27-Jan-19 05:19 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Well, I hope I can reach out to the regions of Victoria and encourage them to support our policies to bring growth and jobs to the regions.


[27-Jan-19 05:20 PM] woofy#0639
Now as the name implies, you will only contest regional/rural seats in Victoria, do you hope in future to expand this to a nation-wide party, and if so what name will you adopt and would your political ideology be influenced by your growth?


[27-Jan-19 05:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We do hope to expand this, yes. Our political ideology would not change, but rather be tailored to other regions. We don't know anything about a name yet.


[27-Jan-19 05:21 PM] woofy#0639
There have been rumours that you will possibly resign and trigger a by-election, so the people in your seat may decide on whether they want the RVA representing them, care to comment on those rumours?


[27-Jan-19 05:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
No.


[27-Jan-19 05:22 PM] woofy#0639
Now for some audience questions!


[27-Jan-19 05:23 PM] woofy#0639
Why does the RVA believe that removing subsidies from their electorate will be a good policy for the people, and a popular one too? From @Deleted User


[27-Jan-19 05:24 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Well, we had an indepth discussion about this, but essentially, by removing subsidies alongside other pieces of regulation, we can allow farmers to innovate and produce more, and ultimately gain more profit and increase our economy.


[27-Jan-19 05:25 PM] woofy#0639
Now another question from Senator Liesel: How do you achieve the ultimate orgasm?

[27-Jan-19 05:27 PM] woofy#0639
From @Plupsnup #today-tonight  Why did you form a new party?


[27-Jan-19 05:28 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I wanted to stand up for my constituents and make a party to represent them.


[27-Jan-19 05:28 PM] woofy#0639
A question from @Gilgamesh #today-tonight why create a party specifically for your electorate rather than be an independent? What is added by the existence of this party to the people of gordon? Also, do you agree with me that CM is a worthless shithead?


[27-Jan-19 05:29 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
To create a wider political movement to stand up for Victorians, and CM is a lovely person.

In regards to your legalisation of drugs, will you support drug testing facilities to test for drugs and to ensure they are not harmed by toxic chemicals?


[27-Jan-19 09:38 PM] woofy#0639
Will you also ensure there are regulations, laws and rules to govern the industry in charge of making drugs to ensure that the drugs are not poisonous or toxic?


[27-Jan-19 09:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well, yes, but not government funded ones. As for ensuring drugs aren't poisonous or toxic... well they inherently are, but that aside, yes there will be and are laws which prevent substances to be sold with excessively poisonous levels of chemicals in them.


[27-Jan-19 09:41 PM] woofy#0639

Thank you for your question. Now as our deputy pm said yesterday, the government is in the process of debating the merits of each option. While I won't comment on the meetings of cabinet, I will make a public comment. I am in support of democracy, democracy has been destroyed in Venezuela. The last elections were not independently verrified, were denounced as corrupt by the opposition and were most of all, called for by the in proper authority. I support democracy and clearly something has to be done in Venezuela to restore it, what that action exactly is, I am keen to hear my fellow debaters on


[28-Jan-19 07:11 PM] woofy#0639
I'd like to hear @Deleted User view on this


[28-Jan-19 07:12 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
We should remain neutral in foreign affairs such as these, Australia has no place meddling with the government of Venezuala


[28-Jan-19 07:12 PM] woofy#0639
( @Deleted User )


[28-Jan-19 07:13 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I disagree, the only act we should promote on the world stage is the support of democracies


[28-Jan-19 07:13 PM] woofy#0639
ok lets get arguing people


[28-Jan-19 07:14 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
Interacting in events such as these will only lead to conflict on the world stage, which would endanger the people of Australia


[28-Jan-19 07:14 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I disagree, we should verbally attack authoritarian regimes


[28-Jan-19 07:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well obviously, Australia needs to make its mark on the world and make itself look stronger on the world stage. We are subject to attack if we look weak when it comes to foreign affairs and I fully support intervention. The people have spoken and they don‚Äôt want Maduro.

[28-Jan-19 07:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Exactly Plupsnup, Venezuela cannot currently be considered a legitmate democracy, Australia should recognise this and support a democratic ideal across the world. To ignore this obvious perversion of government and democracy is more dangerous

thank you, now fight over it


[28-Jan-19 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Again, thank you for your question, though I do think it assumes a false idea. First of, we have continued to work on a budget and plan to release that in Febuary. While I will not comment on the details of that budget, I can say that there will be significant advances made in it towards a better future for Australia. As for Mr AusCon's comment regarding the 'jack shit' we have done for the Australian people, I remind him that climate change is a severe threat to the Australian way of life, and that of our pacific brothers. In partnership with the CA, we have continued to combat climate change and reduce our dependency on Coal. We have also worked to perserve the Australian Tourist industry through condemnation of the renewed interest in Whaling that Japan has taken. Finally, we have protected the future of the planet and Australia by opposing the dangerous spread of Nuclear waste into our country by opposing the Oppositions bill to loosen restrictions.

[28-Jan-19 07:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
We know this to not be true AusCon, in fact Arizona in the US is currently transitioning to an entirely renewable grid, and their efforts so far have been successful. Further, we have seen many advancements in the last two decades that have made your point of view in renewables rather backwards. No insult intended


[28-Jan-19 07:25 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
what specific actions have you taken to diversify Australias energy sources?


[28-Jan-19 07:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can tell you that our budget is making good on our electoral promises to go renewable, and it is also advancing research into all sectors of the economy though an increase in R&D never before seen in previous governments


[28-Jan-19 07:26 PM] Plupsnup#9685
New question? @woofy


[28-Jan-19 07:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well if you look at Victoria, they have one of the largest shares of renewable energy in the country and today they were in a tremendous blackout. Thermal Power Plants had only 76% reliability whilst coal power plants did not fail once, keeping as many lights on as they could

With further development and research we will continue to see renewables increase in reliability. Something we would never see under a right wing government, if your attitude is to be believed

It keeps us from being the targets of foreign attack as we don‚Äôt look weak in foreign eyes!

It puts us in conflict with other nations, retaliation could be taken into the hands of radical groups, as has been demonstrated in the past


[28-Jan-19 07:35 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Fuck Israel


[28-Jan-19 07:35 PM] Plupsnup#9685
There's my take


[28-Jan-19 07:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
A two state solution is the only viable one, and it should have been promoted long ago. The fact that we have given Israel a free pass on this is sad. Certainly I do not call for the destruction of Israel or a grand caliphate in Palestine, but we need to recognise the rights of people to self detrimination. If we ignore that, than we ignore everything anyone should ever stand for. Liberty and Justice are what we should fight for, whether that be actually on the battlefield, in Parliament or in the UN, that is something I will continue to campaign for as a member. A two state solution starts with recognising there is a problem, and oh boy is there a problem, but that problem will not be solved by violence, but by diplomacy. We should not attempt to invade Israel and set up a true 'Democracy' but we should continue our investment in the issue that we have have since the UN was founded. The fact that this is still an issue in the world is a sad reflection of all previous governments, of not only this country, but all UN members. Peace must be restored to the region, and self determination too!

[04-Feb-19 09:01 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Sounds great


[04-Feb-19 09:01 PM] woofy#0639
Ive had the legal nerds check it out, in the Venezuelan Constitution it says, if the assembly votes to, they can remove the President and the President of the National Assembly becomes the interim President


[04-Feb-19 09:02 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Your legal nerds are entirely incorrect.


[04-Feb-19 09:02 PM] woofy#0639
Why has the government made a blunder in its statement about Venezuela


[04-Feb-19 09:02 PM] woofy#0639
They are correct.


[04-Feb-19 09:02 PM] woofy#0639
Can you tell me why the Government refuses to recognise that article of the Venezuelan constitution?


[04-Feb-19 09:03 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now obviously your legal nerds are referring to Article 233 of the Venezuelan Constitution, am I correct?


[04-Feb-19 09:05 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
*coughs*


[04-Feb-19 09:06 PM] woofy#0639
Yes and article 333


[04-Feb-19 09:07 PM] woofy#0639
@LuSing My Religion


[04-Feb-19 09:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Article 333 is totally irrelevant you'll find, as that merely sets out that the Constitution will be followed until it is repealed by the provisions that the Constitution allows itself to be repealed by.


[04-Feb-19 09:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
In fact, this is a case for recognising Maduro as the President, something we have declined to forcefully do.


[04-Feb-19 09:08 PM] woofy#0639
So who do you recognise as the leader of Venezuela?


[04-Feb-19 09:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
If you turn your attention to Article 233, which is the crux of the matter, it states quite clearly some facts that are important here.


[04-Feb-19 09:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
If you'd allow me to answer your first question I will come back to that


[04-Feb-19 09:09 PM] woofy#0639
ok


[04-Feb-19 09:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
233 states what happens in the event that "an elected President becomes permanently unable to serve *prior to his inauguration.*" So since Maduro was inaugurated, even if he is invalid under the following reasons for which a President can be found "permanently unable to serve," we must refer to the latter half of Section 233 which states the Presidency is then assumed by the Vice-President.

However this is a total non-starter because 233 does indeed say that the National Assembly can remove the President, but with the very important caveat that this must be accompanied by a medical board certifying he is medically incapable, which has not happened in this case, or by the National Assembly verifying that he has abandoned his position. As Maduro is quite clearly contesting that he still has the powers of the Presidency, it cannot in any way be claimed that he has abandoned the post. That is a provision that applies in case the President is physically missing, or other such circumstances.


[04-Feb-19 09:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
As a sidenote people are messaging me and telling me you should bring reacts back to your fine network.


[04-Feb-19 09:14 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now to your second question.


[04-Feb-19 09:14 PM] woofy#0639
Well, actually


[04-Feb-19 09:15 PM] woofy#0639
The national assembly declared the current constitution invalid


[04-Feb-19 09:15 PM] woofy#0639
You need to refer to the 2015 constitution


[04-Feb-19 09:15 PM] woofy#0639
Which is different


[04-Feb-19 09:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You are referring to the Constituent National Assembly, I'm assuming, because the National Assembly lacks the authority to unilaterally declare a Constitution that was approved at a referendum invalid.


[04-Feb-19 09:17 PM] woofy#0639
No, they do


[04-Feb-19 09:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
However there is no such thing as the 2015 Constitution.


[04-Feb-19 09:17 PM] woofy#0639
The constitution prior to 2015


[04-Feb-19 09:18 PM] woofy#0639
The constituent national assembly is invalid


[04-Feb-19 09:18 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You are referring to the 1999 Constitution then?


[04-Feb-19 09:18 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And you mean 2017, as that was when the Constituent Assembly was created.


[04-Feb-19 09:19 PM] woofy#0639
Prior to 2015


[04-Feb-19 09:19 PM] woofy#0639
One


[04-Feb-19 09:19 PM] woofy#0639
Anyhoo

Who is the current leader of Venezuela according to the Australian Government


[04-Feb-19 09:19 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You mean Prior to 2017?


[04-Feb-19 09:19 PM] woofy#0639
Who is the current leader of Venezuela according to the Australian Government


[04-Feb-19 09:19 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Because I have been referring to the Sections of the 1999 Constitution, duly approved at a referendum, and the one you insist I must recognise, which I do.


[04-Feb-19 09:21 PM] woofy#0639
Who is the current leader of Venezuela according to the Australian Government


[04-Feb-19 09:21 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
We have declined to recognise Juan Guaido for reasons I made clear above, but you cannot take that as support for Maduro. According to Maduro, legitimate elections have already happened last year, which he won. If we were to support him, we wouldn't be calling for fresh elections, because his term has only just begun.


[04-Feb-19 09:21 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Ultimately whoever wins UN and Carter Centre verified elections will have the full support and recognition of the Australian government.


[04-Feb-19 09:23 PM] woofy#0639
SO WHOSE THE LEADER OF VENEZUELA THEN?


[04-Feb-19 09:23 PM] woofy#0639
I WANT A NAME.


[04-Feb-19 09:23 PM] woofy#0639
IS IT THAT HARD TO GIVE US A NAME?


[04-Feb-19 09:24 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The name is Nicolas Maduro, however only very tentatively as we are calling for him to go to fresh elections.


[04-Feb-19 09:24 PM] woofy#0639
SO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT STILL RECOGNISES MADURO AS THE OFFICIAL LEADER OF VENEZUELA?


[04-Feb-19 09:25 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
That's a few decibels higher than I put it but yes that is indeed what I said.


[04-Feb-19 09:25 PM] woofy#0639
Now, moving onto to how you became Deputy Prime Minister


[04-Feb-19 09:26 PM] woofy#0639
Isn't it true you are only the DPM because you threatened and bullied the Prime Minister into the position?


[04-Feb-19 09:26 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
...


[04-Feb-19 09:26 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
No?


[04-Feb-19 09:27 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The previous Deputy Prime Minister, god bless him, chose to step down for personal reasons.


[04-Feb-19 09:27 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And then the position of Deputy Prime Minister went to the leader of the junior coalition partner.


[04-Feb-19 09:27 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
It is a very standard thing.

[04-Feb-19 09:31 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

[04-Feb-19 09:31 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

OK so basically im going to do a line of cane toad venom.


[03-Mar-19 06:57 PM] waltor#3519
This is all in the name of science.


[03-Mar-19 06:59 PM] waltor#3519
According to an unreferenced passage in Wikipedia, "The toxins may have been used as an entheogen by the Olmec people." which lived where the cane toad naturally came from.


[03-Mar-19 06:59 PM] waltor#3519
This is probably because of the bufotenin in it, which is debatably psychedelic.


[03-Mar-19 07:00 PM] waltor#3519

[03-Mar-19 07:00 PM] waltor#3519
OK so I have my cane toad lined up and have just scraped off some of the venom.

On tonight's show we will be looking at the Cotote saga


[06-Apr-19 09:28 PM] Plupsnup#9685
It all started when Cotote, a social democrat, started hatin'on the queer folk


[06-Apr-19 09:29 PM] Plupsnup#9685
My sources allege that in private conversations, Cotote used the term 'faggot' to refer to members of the Liberal Democratic Party


[06-Apr-19 09:30 PM] Plupsnup#9685
He has not said sorry for what was said, yet


[06-Apr-19 09:31 PM] Plupsnup#9685
He persists that he used the term 'faggot', to refer to members of the LDP as a bundle of sticks, not in referring to them as homosexual persons


[06-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Members of the socialist party have called on the Prime Minister to suspend Cotote from the Social Democratic Party, and are calling on Cotote to resign from office

More updates on this story will come as time progresses.

Let me just say that when I degraded the left wing movement; the labour movement, the socialist movement, the centrist movement, I was high on anti-depressants and and what I said wasn't right. It is not right to call the Opposition bad things and it is not right to say there is nothing redeemable about leftism. Everyone is entitled to their beliefs. Me, you, everyone. And opinions are never wrong

**TODAY TONIGHT BREAKING NEWS:**


[10-Jun-19 07:21 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Hello I'm Alex Monti, we have breaking news from Canberra tonight.


[10-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Prime Minister Lucy has announced her resignation as Leader of the Socialist Party and as Prime Minister at a Press Conference only moments ago.


[10-Jun-19 07:22 PM] Matt Monti#4771
She said "It is with deep regret that I tell the Australian people tonight that I am unable to carry on as the Prime Minister of Australia, and as the Leader of the Socialist Party."


[10-Jun-19 07:24 PM] Matt Monti#4771
before this announcement, the outgoing PM mentioned how proud she was of her governments achievements, specifically mentioning the successful Republic Vote that she claimed voters had been "crying out for ever since the election of the Bsharri Government."


[10-Jun-19 07:25 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Lucy has sighted personal health concerns as her main reason for leaving the top job saying "I believe I would be doing a disservice to the Australian people if I remained on as Prime Minister while being unable to commit myself fully to the job."


[10-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Matt Monti#4771
In **EVEN MORE BREAKING NEWS** Lucy has named AG Sprinkles as the New PM and leader of the Socialist Party, with AMN taking the deputy Leadership.


[10-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Matt Monti#4771
We here at Today Tonight would like to wish the outgoing PM all the best with her career and offer our thanks to her for her service to the nation as Prime Minister.


[10-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Thank you for tuning in, I'm Alex Monti. Goodnight.

Allias Punspulp here with a developing story


[11-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Plupsnup#9685
New PM, PM-ME-SPRINKLES miiiiight be a racist against Asians... 
Whig leader Plupsnup has changed his Twitter username to "New PM is a racist"  saying to me that he believes the new PM is racist against Asians because "they are taking Australian jobs away from Australia and back to their country of origin". 
When I asked the new PM for a comment on the matter asking if she was racist against Asians, she said "no comment"
Why couldn't she just say no?


[11-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Plupsnup#9685
More will come as this story develops

"New PM might be racist." It's not even funnily bad journalism.
