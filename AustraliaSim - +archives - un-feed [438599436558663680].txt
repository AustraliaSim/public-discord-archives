**BREAKING NEWS OUT OF PAPUA, INDONESIA**,@here

6:58 PM local time

The Associated Press has received word that a military conflict has seemingly broken loose in the Indonesian province of Papua. Since its founding, the province has been on the brink of full-on civil war as Papua nationalists called for the area to be unified with Papua New Guinea rather than being subservient to the nation of Indonesia. Over the past few months the Free Papua Movement has grown in numbers and has received the support of an unknown but powerful benefactor, and the political climate of the province has grown more and tenser.

In the early morning hours word reach the press that a violent exchange had occurred between the Free Papua Movement and the Indonesian military, but we had yet to determine if the conflict was ongoing or if there was a victor. At approximately 6:37 PM local time the AP was able to confirm that the Free Papua Movement had seemingly taken control of two small villages in Eastern Papua near the border with Papua New Guinea and had successfully pushed back the countryâ€™s military.

Papua New Guineaâ€™s government has largely stayed quiet regarding the violence right along its border, leading some to speculate that they are either working in tangent with the Indonesian government to resolve the matter or they had some information regarding the violent incursion in advance.

@deleted-role, **A STATEMENT MADE BY THE NEW ZEALAND AMBASSADOR TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY**


[28-Apr-18 01:42 PM] _slothsworth#4496
silicon_based_life,
Mr President,
Representing New Zealand as the ambassador,
New Zealand acknowledges the breaking events occurring in West Papua. In the absence of an official statement from the New Zealand government, we urge all countries to reserve judgement of involved parties except to the extent that military action is causing civilian displacement and deaths. We believe that military action like this should never be necessary and urge all involved parties to reconsider their stances.

@deleted-role, **ESCALATION IN PAPUA CONFLICT**

1:58 PM local time

AP can now confirm that the Free Papua Movement was successful in their attempt to take control of a handful of small villages in the eastern region of the province, with the Indonesian military largely having been forced to pull away from the fight. Initially the Associated Press had sources stating this was a disunified assault and would likely lead to nothing of substance, but now it appears the polar opposite has become a reality. It seems the groups are all working in unison under the FPM flag and at least **10** members of the Peopleâ€™s Representative Council have been taken hostage.

There is a very real chance that this conflict will only further escalate and serve to boost the rampant instability already predominant in the region. Some are fearful that a violent coup may be in the works to finally separate the region from Indonesia, this fear is only further boosted by the government of Papua New Guineaâ€™s silence on the matter. They have yet to release any form of statement on the conflict right next to their border, leading some to speculate that either ranking government officials or the government may be the benefactor helping the FPM, though no evidence has yet to be brought forward.

@deleted-role, **BOMBSHELL REPORT POINTS THE FINGER AT PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS CONFLICT ESCALATE**
9:51 AM, Jakarta, Indonesia.
Days after the initial spout of violence between the Free Papua Movement and the Indonesia Government, tensions are still heightened as 10 members of the Peopleâ€™s Representative Council are still being held hostage and another village near the border has been taken. Less than an hour ago a bombshell report revealed ties between the benefactors of the movement and a handful of nationalist politicians from Papua New Guinea, leading many to accuse the nation of fueling what has now been deemed a coup by Indonesian officials.
Indonesian troops have reportedly been dispatched to try and retake one of the villages, with some gains being made as they retook the outskirts of the area. However, the guerrilla tactics they've been faced by have proven to be a major impediment to any major progress. We'll report more information as we have it.
