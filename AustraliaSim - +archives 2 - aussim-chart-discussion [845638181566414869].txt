**Instructions**:
Submit a list of 10 songs here for the AusSim weekly charts. These can be any songs — your most listened, your favourite songs, or just a list of songs you think will be funny. These songs will be tallied up using an inverse points system — so basically, #1 will get 10 points, #2 gets 9 points, etc  — to calculate the weekly AustraliaSim Top 10!
**Template**
*Please include both artist and song. Example — "Blank Space" by Taylor Swift.*

just follow my submissions, generally i do that


[08-Aug-21 07:36 PM] inactive#6974
If you've listened to Crazy Frog 50 times that week i gotta pay respects to you


[08-Aug-21 07:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the only reason why i dont just submit my most listened to is that I listen to too many songs in a week and dont loop them very often
