Our top story tonight..the Liberty Party has formed government!


[04-Feb-18 08:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Following a victory in the Kingston by-Election, the Centrist Alliance, Republican Party, Social Democrats and the Imperial Party have supported a Liberty Government, with the CA and the IPA providing confidence and supply rather than a full government, with @BellmanTGM as Prime Minister and @waltor as Deputy Prime Minister.


[04-Feb-18 08:54 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
It has a minority of 2 out of 9 senate seats and a majority of 9 out of 17 House Seats.


[04-Feb-18 08:55 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The Centrist Alliance has also broken their own mantra of risking it with the radicals.


[04-Feb-18 08:55 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Will it pay off?


[04-Feb-18 08:56 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
*Edit: This article initially indicated that the Liberty Party won the Lingiari by election. That was, in fact, won by @AnswerMeNow2. They had won the Kingston by-Election. We apologise for any inconveniences caused.*


[04-Feb-18 09:16 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
*Addendums: Earlier versions of this article suggested @Catiline was supporting the government, the CA and IPA were in government, and that the government had a majority in the senate. That was erroneous.*

And we have some news! Prime Minister BellmanTGM has announced that his government aims to pass the Electoral Simulation Bill (2018), and hold elections when it is passed. He also called his government ‚Äúin effect, an interim government.‚Äù Considering the passing of the bill would most likely happen very quickly after the election, is this undemocratic? The Socialist Party leader, Bsharri, has stated that ‚ÄúI honestly don't think the GG should have allowed them to form government,‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm just astounded nobody sees the problem with putting together a government for one law‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt's the definition of a non-government‚Äù. Could this lead to a possible vote of no confidence being called against Prime Minister Bellman so early in his term?

Breaking news! Member for Lyne, MaiqTheLiar42 has joined the Socialist Party. Previously serving as an independent MP, Maiq was originally a member of the New Labour Party, but following its collapse, became an the independent she was until recently. Calling the opposition an ‚Äúunholy alliance of laissez-faire capitalists, Keynesians, monarchists and republicans,‚Äù Maiq defected to the party earlier tonight, claiming he‚Äôll continue to represent the workers of Lyne. Will he? We‚Äôll have to wait and see. The defection increases the Socialist numbers in house from 4 to 5.


[05-Feb-18 06:49 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
John Galt, MP for Kingston has stated his opposition, tweeting ‚ÄúI do wish people would stop joining/changing parties post election. Just serve out the 3 months and change once the election is called, imo.‚Äù

Australia Tonight would like to announce that we will be conducting an **opinion poll** to gauge the favourability of this current government, the results of which will be revealed tonight.

And today we start with news from the parliament.


[09-Feb-18 07:03 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Although this is a little late to report, General_Rommel was re-elected as Speaker of the House uncontested.


[09-Feb-18 07:04 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
However, the elections for Deputy Speaker were slightly more controversial. Ultimately, a secret vote among the House of Representatives resulted in @Harold being elected as deputy speaker, and @Deleted User being elected as second deputy speaker.


[09-Feb-18 07:06 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
In the Senate (again, somewhat of a late report), @TheWhiteFerret was elected as President. And the Deputy President position is also contested, between @PineappleCrusher_ and @Deleted User.


[09-Feb-18 07:07 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Results of the opinion poll shall be revealed at 8:00 pm AEST.


[09-Feb-18 07:28 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The opinion poll results are currently being calculated.


[09-Feb-18 07:32 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, we're ready to begin announcing the results.


[09-Feb-18 07:33 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Our first question- "Are you satisfied with how the current government is governing?"


[09-Feb-18 07:34 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Apologies, we will fix the chart.


[09-Feb-18 07:37 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Apologies for the delay. But here are the first results.

[09-Feb-18 07:37 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
A plurality of respondents are satisfied with the current government, it seems.


[09-Feb-18 07:38 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Onto Question 2, "Do you think BellmanTGM is a suitable Prime Minister?"

[09-Feb-18 07:41 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
A majority of respondents did view BellmanTGM as a suitable Prime Minister. Perhaps this means his government has more support than some think?


[09-Feb-18 07:41 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, the next question. "Do you think CircleSongIsDank is a suitable Deputy Prime Minister?"

And, well..


[09-Feb-18 07:44 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The numbers speak for themselves. It seems as if the public is split on @waltor's suitability for his job.


[09-Feb-18 07:44 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And now, onto our final question. "Do you view the current government as stable?"

Once again, a plurality of respondents do agree that the current government is stable.

#nine-network is currently broadcasting an opinion poll on the favourability of the government and favourability of the parties.


[17-Feb-18 05:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
It appears as if the majority of AustraliaSim citizens are unhappy with the current government.


[17-Feb-18 05:54 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And...is this correct....Centre Alliance leader @djello currently has a plurality of votes for preferred PM out of BellmanTGM, Bsharri, Circle_Song_Is_Dank, and NotKhruschevsGhost.


[17-Feb-18 05:55 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
1 vote behind is BellmanTGM, the incumbent Prime Minister.


[17-Feb-18 05:55 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
A further 2 votes behind dyljam are Bsharri and NotKhrushchevsGhost.


[17-Feb-18 05:55 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And on a humiliating 8 votes behind Dyljam‚Äôs 10, is Circle_Song_Is_Dank, on 2.


[17-Feb-18 05:56 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And...it seems the majority of citizens support the Electoral Simulation bill- 22 out of 31 surveyed.


[17-Feb-18 05:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
No further results are coming in from National Review.


[17-Feb-18 05:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Also, one mistake.


[17-Feb-18 05:59 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
NKG was 4 votes behind Dyljam, not 2 as previously indicated.


[17-Feb-18 06:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Our top story- Speaker of the House @General_Rommel has introduced a motion of no confidence in the house against the Liberty Government. Debate is currently occuring in the House of Representatives. In response, the Socialists and the Greens have formed a shadow cabinet, saying that "it is now clear that the position of Bellman and the Liberty Party is untenable." @Harold was declared leader of the opposition.


[20-Feb-18 05:29 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
It's unclear if the government has the numbers to survive, with the Imperial Party participating in the Socialist walkout on Sunday.


[20-Feb-18 05:29 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Assuming full MP turnout, if their MP @Deleted User votes in favour of the motion, that would be the death knoll for the BellmanTGM government.


[20-Feb-18 05:30 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And now, to what you've all been waiting for..


[20-Feb-18 05:31 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

It seems that a majority of the population of AusSim, at least according to our poll, did **not** support the government's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.


[20-Feb-18 05:33 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
About 52% of AustraliaSim citizens are against it, compared to 44% in favour and 4% not caring.

All Socialist MPs have voted in favour. @Harold and @General_Rommel have both voted in favour. All Liberty and Centrist MPs, plus @waltor have voted against.

[13-Apr-18 05:11 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Thanks for your input. @Youmaton?


[13-Apr-18 05:13 PM] Youmaton#1190
I would agree with this current analogue. Currently we are looked at even numbers between CA/Libs and Soc/Labor, which leaves myself and the pirates to decide. I personally hope with working to being together a better Australia, in which I see the Soc/Labor coalition as a better option to do so. With the pirates, they are a bit of a wild card, however CSID has hinted towards maybe leaning to the Socs and Labor, so we may see a minority government there.


[13-Apr-18 05:14 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright.  @waltor what do you think? Do you have any party preference?


[13-Apr-18 05:15 PM] waltor#3519
It's looking like there will indeed be a Labor/Soc coalition, and the Pirates would be happy to work with them - either providing supply or possibly even joining them in coalition.


[13-Apr-18 05:16 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. Finally, @Sleet? What‚Äôs your opinion on the matter?

We‚Äôll open it up to debate across the panel now.


[13-Apr-18 05:19 PM] Sleet#6678
I believe it really could go either way


[13-Apr-18 05:20 PM] waltor#3519
Honestly, looking at the electorate demographics it will be tight.


[13-Apr-18 05:20 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Well as a greenway voter I hope it turns out Labor but Viado is someone I respect. Its a shame that Rommel pulled out. He did wonderful things for Greenway and this country


[13-Apr-18 05:21 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. How do you think Lingiari will swing?


[13-Apr-18 05:22 PM] Sleet#6678
This is an interesting one, being one of the few electorates with three candidates


[13-Apr-18 05:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
well, if i may flatter our host, I hope he keeps his seat. Im not too familiar with the Lingiari info we have thus far


[13-Apr-18 05:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so i really wouldnt know


[13-Apr-18 05:22 PM] Sleet#6678
I do believe that you will come out on top, AMN, but I've been wrong before


[13-Apr-18 05:22 PM] Youmaton#1190
It will honestly be close, though through current stats we may have a run down between Soc and Lib


[13-Apr-18 05:23 PM] waltor#3519
Lingiari will be inbetween the Socs and Libs, but I think looking honestly at everything it'll be a Liberal victory.


[13-Apr-18 05:23 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What impact do you think modifiers will have on the election?


[13-Apr-18 05:23 PM] Sleet#6678
I hope that they help


[13-Apr-18 05:23 PM] Sleet#6678
By the love of God, I hope they help


[13-Apr-18 05:24 PM] Sleet#6678
I am not confident in my prospects of winning my seat, despite my extensive campaign


[13-Apr-18 05:24 PM] Sleet#6678
The modifiers will help, but I don't think they will secure my seat


[13-Apr-18 05:25 PM] Sleet#6678
It gives the more active and committed members of our community an edge, which I believe is a good thing. However, direct votes are the main thing that will swing a seat


[13-Apr-18 05:26 PM] waltor#3519
Modifiers will make things slightly more fair, but I think they should have far more say over the outcome of the election.


[13-Apr-18 05:26 PM] waltor#3519
Either none or 50% simmed voters.

Id also love to take the opportunity if i may to praise the AEC for this elections handling. The modifiers and new voting method are really top notch and can only get better, so well done to Runas and TEF


[13-Apr-18 05:27 PM] waltor#3519
Runas is the best.


[13-Apr-18 05:27 PM] Youmaton#1190

I wish he was a candidate


[13-Apr-18 05:28 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. One more thing, what do you think is the one thing Australia needs the most at the moment?


[13-Apr-18 05:28 PM] waltor#3519
Runas as PM.


[13-Apr-18 05:28 PM] Youmaton#1190
A budget


[13-Apr-18 05:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Runas as PM


[13-Apr-18 05:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
No but seriously?


[13-Apr-18 05:29 PM] Youmaton#1190
Oof


[13-Apr-18 05:29 PM] waltor#3519
A Bill of Rights!


[13-Apr-18 05:29 PM] Sleet#6678
Prosperity and security is what my party would want me to say. However, I want to give a serious answer and avoid memes here. I believe the thing Australia needs is a stable government.


[13-Apr-18 05:29 PM] Sleet#6678
A fragmented government will just bring us into the same loop we've been in for months

I believe that we need to focus on caring for our citizens as best we can. Free education, improved workers rights. And the pirate party's bill of rights policy is something that brings tears of joy/pride to my eye

Even if I don't win Brisbane, I will do my best to work on party relations


[13-Apr-18 05:30 PM] waltor#3519
This election, there doesn't seem to be anywhere near the level of hostility. It's looking like people will be nice and will negotiate and compromise in the best interests of the people.

Last election was an utter REDACTEDshow. People were very hostile. And we got a REDACTED fragmented government out of it.

First up, **Batman.**


[13-Apr-18 07:37 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We are predicting a :CA: gain from :Pirate:.


[13-Apr-18 07:38 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Bradfield**


[13-Apr-18 07:38 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We are predicting a possible supplementary election, but it not, it will be a :Liberal: gain from :CA:.


[13-Apr-18 07:38 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Brisbane**


[13-Apr-18 07:39 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Too close to call. Could lead to supps, but just as easily a :Pirate: or :Liberal: gain.


[13-Apr-18 07:40 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Canberra**
Most likely a :Labor: gain from National. We will also note that all voters have voted here.


[13-Apr-18 07:40 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Chisholm**
Not much to say, other than that independent candidate @Youmaton is running unopposed.


[13-Apr-18 07:41 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Denison**
Most likely a supplementary election, but if not, most likely a :Liberal: gain from :greens:.


[13-Apr-18 07:43 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Fairfax**  

Probably a :Liberal: gain from :Labor:.


[13-Apr-18 07:44 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Gorton**
Somewhat unclear. Probably a :CA: gain from :greens:.


[13-Apr-18 07:45 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Greenway**
Once again, unclear. We‚Äôre predicting a narrow :Liberal: gain from :rommel:.


[13-Apr-18 07:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Kingston**
:CA: gain from National.


[13-Apr-18 07:48 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Lingiari**
This is an interesting one. Incumbent @AnswerMeNow2 dominates the simmed votes, but flounders in manual votes. On the current votes, we‚Äôre predicting a narrow :socialist: hold.


[13-Apr-18 07:49 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Lyne**
:socialist: hold.


[13-Apr-18 07:51 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Melbourne**
:Pirate: gain from :Labor:.


[13-Apr-18 07:52 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Pearce**
A narrow :socialist: hold.


[13-Apr-18 07:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Sydney**
Once again, close, but most likely :Labor: gain from :Liberal:.


[13-Apr-18 07:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Whitlam**
:Liberal: gain from :Pirate:.


[13-Apr-18 07:54 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Wright**
:Liberal: gain from :socialist:.


[13-Apr-18 07:56 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
This would mean the lower house would look like this-
3 CA
4 LIB
2 LAB

Today on the show we have @ChairmanMeeseeks, Socialist candidate for the Senate!


[14-Apr-18 06:39 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Good evening Australia, thank you for having me AMN, its wonderful to be here


[14-Apr-18 06:41 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, you are number 2 on the Socialist ticket for the senate. Number 1 on the ticket is, of course, myself. Now, if I win the seat of Lingiari, you would be effectively Number 1 on the Socialist ticket for the senate, but many news networks, including #abc-feed, have deemed this unlikely. What are your thoughts on whether you will enter parliament?


[14-Apr-18 06:43 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Pinned a message.


[14-Apr-18 06:44 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Well i probably should concede to the ABC but it seems they are calling in favor of you in Lingiari, and with the excellent campaign you've run in Lingiari, I think modifiers will really help cement the majority that you have there, leaving me with the Senate seat
But i think that as someone with little expertise in this field, i probably should concede to the ABC analysis


[14-Apr-18 06:45 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. And what do you think about the numbers? What in your mind is the most likely government?


[14-Apr-18 06:47 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
With the current calls, it seems unlikely that the original estimates on last nights panel were correct and we'll be heading into parliament a fairly strong opposition against a liberal CA coalition but I think that the modifiers and last minute voters could turn that around


[14-Apr-18 06:48 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What do you think is the best move for the Socialist Party in the future?


[14-Apr-18 06:50 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
I think we need to get our base mobilized a lot more and start having more cross party negotiations so even when we arent in government, so we can help put in place policies that everyone will agree on as beneficial for this country.


[14-Apr-18 06:52 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
We have many Socialist members who are sort of apathetic to campaigning and we need to get them onboard
Aside from those few things I struggle to think of much else that we as a party could do, we ran a great campaign this cycle and I dont think there's much more we could've done


[14-Apr-18 06:53 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. Who do you think you‚Äôd be willing to work with?


[14-Apr-18 06:54 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
In terms of cross party stuff anybody really but in terms of forming a ruling coalition Youmaton, Labor and Pirates are really it for me


[14-Apr-18 06:55 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. And finally, what do you think of our predictions?


[14-Apr-18 06:56 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
I think that they're probably the most accurate predictions coming out right now but I'll be curious as to how they change after polls close and last minute voters/modifiers come in


[14-Apr-18 06:57 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
But for the current info, you guys have done an amazing job


[14-Apr-18 07:00 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
OK. Thank you for coming on. Do you have anything else to say?


[14-Apr-18 07:01 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[14-Apr-18 07:05 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We are going to make predictions for **Denison** and the **4th senate seat.**


[14-Apr-18 07:05 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
For **Denison**, it‚Äôs looking more and more like a :Labor: gain from :greens:.


[14-Apr-18 07:07 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
As for the **4th senate seat**, it‚Äôs a close one, but our computers are predicting a :CA: seat. Of course, this could depend hugely on which way the preferences flow. The right amount of Labor and Socialist preferences could swing that last seat to the :Pirate:, but for now we are predicting it will be a :CA: seat.


[14-Apr-18 07:08 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
So, with that in mind, here is what parliament looks like-


[14-Apr-18 07:08 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**House of Representatives**
3 CA
4 LIB
3 LAB
1 IND
1 PIR
4 SOC
**Senate**
3 SOC
2 LIB
1 LAB
1 PIR
2 CA

[14-Apr-18 07:12 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
So far there is the possibility of a Socialist-Labor-Pirate-Youmaton Government, having 9 seats in the house and 5 in the senate. But it‚Äôs very close. If the Socialists don‚Äôt hold Lingiari or Pearce, or Labor doesn‚Äôt gain Sydney, the idea of that government is essentially dead.


[14-Apr-18 07:13 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And of course, on our current predictions, former Pirate Party leader and man who did something unspeakable here last night, @waltor would not be returning to parliament.

[14-Apr-18 08:02 AM] waltor#3519
Good to be here.


[14-Apr-18 08:03 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, the majority of predictions have shown you are unlikely to enter parliament. What do you think about that?


[14-Apr-18 08:05 AM] waltor#3519
If it was soley my party voting for me, I would not make it into the senate. However quite a few other people have preferenced me in positions that will have prefs flow in my favour. Honestly still, I probably won‚Äôt win.


[14-Apr-18 08:06 AM] waltor#3519
If I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll still be working closely with the Pirate Party and helping out with stuff. Getting into the sanet is far harder than the house, and I think I‚Äôve gone well to get to this point.


[14-Apr-18 08:06 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Who is your preferred coalition partner?


[14-Apr-18 08:07 AM] waltor#3519
Personally I enjoy the crossbench, but the party leadership is hinting either Labor or Socialists. They both have things we disagree on, but they‚Äôre far closer to us politically than the Libs or even the CA.


[14-Apr-18 08:08 AM] waltor#3519
Even if we did join a coalition, we would hold it to account and widthdraw if we felt it wasn‚Äôt in the best interest of the Australian people.


[14-Apr-18 08:09 AM] waltor#3519
*removes shoe*


[14-Apr-18 08:12 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. What lower house seats do you think your party has a chance in? We‚Äôve predicted you will win Melbourne.


[14-Apr-18 08:14 AM] waltor#3519
Melbourne will probably be a Pirate Victory, and we‚Äùre also looking at a Pirate victory in Brisbane based off my predictions.


[14-Apr-18 08:16 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. Do you have any predictions regarding the seats or ideas about what could happen?


[14-Apr-18 08:17 AM] waltor#3519
They all look Ok.


[14-Apr-18 08:17 AM] waltor#3519
The predictions.


[14-Apr-18 08:17 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Also, could you put your shoe back on?


[14-Apr-18 08:18 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Anyway, what do you predict the CA will do in a kingmaker position?


[14-Apr-18 08:22 AM] waltor#3519
Probably remain crossbench and possibly offer supply. That‚Äôs with either government.


[14-Apr-18 08:23 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

[14-Apr-18 08:24 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Not about the cabbage?


[14-Apr-18 08:26 AM] waltor#3519
Not really. Remember to vote for whoever you believe is best!

We have a few updates to our predictions.


[14-Apr-18 08:40 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Firstly, **Brisbane** is now in doubt.


[14-Apr-18 08:42 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Along with **Fairfax.**


[14-Apr-18 08:47 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And that‚Äôs all.


[14-Apr-18 08:48 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
So, with that in mind, here‚Äôs the makeup of parliament-
**House of Representatives**

And now, less than an hour before polls close, we have Socialist Party leader and President of the Senate, @Deleted User!


[14-Apr-18 10:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hello, glad to be here.


[14-Apr-18 10:38 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, how do you feel about your party‚Äôs hopes for the election? You are predicted to hold 3 seats in the house and gain 1 seat in the senate.


[14-Apr-18 10:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well I think there may be a few surprises.


[14-Apr-18 10:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Based on our data there has been a significantly low turnout amongst right-wing voters.


[14-Apr-18 10:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
This happens every election, but its even more pronounced this year.


[14-Apr-18 10:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it is very much possible that the Socialist Party could get 4 seats.


[14-Apr-18 10:40 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Apologies, we did actually call Bradfield for the Socs so we predicted 4 seats not 3.


[14-Apr-18 10:41 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Anyway, do you think your party will be forming government?


[14-Apr-18 10:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Batman is also looking very favourable right now.


[14-Apr-18 10:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don't know. Ultimately it comes down to the ALP and their willingness to work with us for another term above the CA.


[14-Apr-18 10:43 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
If you are to form government, are you hoping for a Socialist PM?


[14-Apr-18 10:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don't think that will happen anytime soon. The political landscape right now is more polarized than it has ever been. The presence of 4 major parties is very unique in Australian politics


[14-Apr-18 10:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Our political landscape for this election looks more like that of Spain than a regular Australian election


[14-Apr-18 10:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
In that climate there is little chance of us ever gaining the plurality needed to get support for our program.


[14-Apr-18 10:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
But anyway, its not all about elections. We can pass laws and have a positive influence on the political landscape, but we can also built up grassroots organizing amongst students, workers, and minorities outside parliament.


[14-Apr-18 10:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think that is just as important and the real key to changing our society.


[14-Apr-18 10:52 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. What do you think about the future of the Socialist Party? Is it sustainable?


[14-Apr-18 10:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, I think there is a lot of potential for further growth in the Socialist Party. Right now we need to consolidate the current layer of people we have and build on that. Having a left-wing party is immensely important and a project worth throwing ourselves into. I hope more people take up the cause.


[14-Apr-18 10:57 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What do you think of partnering with the Pirate Party?


[14-Apr-18 10:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
It may be possible, but I have my apprehensions about the Pirates.


[14-Apr-18 10:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
They dont really seem to stand for anything.


[14-Apr-18 10:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
And they flip flop between quite left-wing positions but then also show hostility towards the left and do deals with the right.


[14-Apr-18 10:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think they are a long way from rehabilitating their image after the debacle that was the Bellman government. I think they lost a lot of credibility entering that government.


[14-Apr-18 11:22 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. Thank you for your time, Senator.


[14-Apr-18 11:22 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Do you have anything else you‚Äôd like to say? @Deleted User


[14-Apr-18 11:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
I would like to say that I stand unequivocally against the American, British, and French bombing taking place in Damascus right now.


[14-Apr-18 11:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
The last thing Syrians who have been fighting for their freedom against the butcher dictator Assad for more than a decade now need is more American bombs.

And finally, deputy leader of the Socialist Party, Minister for Education and member for Chisholm, @Youmaton!


[29-Apr-18 12:19 PM] Youmaton#1190
Hello!


[29-Apr-18 12:21 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. Our first question to the panelists is regarding the Conservative Party. After standing only @umatbru in Melbourne who recieved a shocking 0 votes, and with their leader, @Deleted User being held on remand, what do you think about the party‚Äôs future?


[29-Apr-18 12:21 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
@Sleet may answer first.


[29-Apr-18 12:22 PM] Sleet#6678
It certainly doesn't look good, does it?


[29-Apr-18 12:22 PM] Sleet#6678
On one hand, I would advise that perhaps they change their policies to match what the public want


[29-Apr-18 12:22 PM] Sleet#6678
However, that would be unacceptable in a way.


[29-Apr-18 12:23 PM] Sleet#6678
A party should stand firm by its beliefs.


[29-Apr-18 12:23 PM] Sleet#6678
Hopefully they can work out a solution.


[29-Apr-18 12:23 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. @One Nation to Rule them All Your thoughts?


[29-Apr-18 12:24 PM] One Nation to Rule them All#9048
The Conservative Party believes in small Government, so I believe they should make Government smaller by disbanding

It's interesting to see the conservative party falling apart like this. However, with Jenga no longer in custody, they will be a party to watch to see if they attempt any kind of comeback during the next election.

[29-Apr-18 12:32 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. In the Leader‚Äôs Debate, umatbru stated ‚Äúin Melbourne the city is being overrun by gangs... the police are not cracking down hard enough. The Safe Schools program is forcing sex down our children's throats. ANTIFA, an organisation listed by the United States Government as a terrorist organisation [sic] are lurking in our university campuses.‚Äú

@One Nation to Rule them All He was essentially the *de facto* leader of the Conservatives while JengaLucile was being held on remand. He was the party‚Äôs only candidate.


[29-Apr-18 12:37 PM] One Nation to Rule them All#9048
He should resign and leave the sim in disgrace


[29-Apr-18 12:38 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

[29-Apr-18 12:38 PM] Youmaton#1190
I completely denounce his comments. That's all there is to say. There's a good reason he didn't get a single vote.

Alright. Now, onto the new Socialist-Labor-Pirate government. What do you think are the chances it will remain stable? @Sleet


[29-Apr-18 12:44 PM] Sleet#6678
Though it doesn't include my party, I imagine it will remain stable


[29-Apr-18 12:45 PM] Sleet#6678
CSID has expressed interest in working with the parties in that government


[29-Apr-18 12:45 PM] Sleet#6678

Well


[29-Apr-18 02:21 PM] Youmaton#1190
I do question the validity of that poll, no offence. Given AMN's vote at the last election, according to that poll he should've lost, but he won quite spectacularly. Personally, I hope that he does stop with the socs, at least until the end of this term.


[29-Apr-18 02:24 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Stop with the Socs? To quote Pauline Hanson, please explain?


[29-Apr-18 02:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
Oops, stuttered there. By that I mean that I hope he does remain with the socialist party, at least until the next election. I know I'm not one to talk about changing colour midterm, however given his anti-stance to the matter I imagine he would not want to be seen as hypocritical by leaving. I do hope to keep working well with AMN however :)


[29-Apr-18 02:30 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Ah, OK.


[29-Apr-18 02:31 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

[29-Apr-18 02:48 PM] Youmaton#1190
Hmm


[29-Apr-18 02:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
The socialist party would certainly never work with them, obviously. Personally I would be surprised if they could get such a comeback, however I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to agree with any of their policies.


[29-Apr-18 02:50 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What do you think, @Ash?


[29-Apr-18 02:52 PM] Ash#8178
The Liberal Party will never work with the conservatives, due to their expression of being alt right.


[29-Apr-18 02:54 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Ah, that brings me onto our next point. What do you think of the alt right and Antifa? @Youmaton


[29-Apr-18 02:55 PM] One Nation to Rule them All#9048
If they won a seat or two they should probably study what an unofficial opposition is and get cracking

I completely am against the alt-right ideology. It's just horrible. 

In terms of ANTIFA, I disagree completely with their message of violence, but honestly they are better then a lot of the alt-right. ANTIFA aren't a problem in Australia though, unlike a slow growing trend that is leading to a rise in the alt-right ideology across the world.

I think it was quite rash, given I believe the government still had supply and confidence, and there was still bills to be passed. However, he was well within his right in doing so, and I thank him for his service as a parliamentarian, socialist leader, and as the Prime Minister.

[18-May-18 07:06 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Hmm. I suppose I call it cowardly for the fact it implies the Liberals are scared to head to the polls. But I suppose you can be right.

[19-May-18 07:36 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The map is geographically dominated by the Liberals, who hold most of Queensland and rural NSW and Victoria, while the Socialists take up the states of Queensland and the Northern Territory, as well as some urban areas, most notably Batman.


[19-May-18 07:37 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The political landscape has not changed hugely since last election. We expect the next election map to look similar to this map.


[19-May-18 07:38 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
It's a possibility @Youmaton may face a strong challenge in his electorate from the Centre Alliance or the Liberals, maybe even the Conservatives.


[19-May-18 07:41 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
In fact, a couple of weeks ago, we discussed the future of the Conservatives. Senator TheSilentAsh stated 'The conservatives should disband....They are inactive and pointless..' The Centre Alliance candidate for Lingiari, Timewalker102 stated 'Chances are [Umatbru is] an incel who could never talk to girls in high school so he sees the sex-positive moment with spite' in response to Umatbru's comments on the safe school program, also stating that 'The Conservative Party believes in small Government, so I believe they should make Government smaller by disbanding'.


[19-May-18 07:42 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Anyway, along with Chisholm, there's also the possibility of the Socialists losing Denison, as this was a close election last election, and the incumbent member is currently fighting a High Court case.


[19-May-18 07:44 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And, judging by our Australia Tonight poll, @AnswerMeNow2 could lose Lingiari.


[19-May-18 07:44 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Wait, I could lose Lingiari?

Hello! First off all, I wish to apologise for what happened during the tail end of the last term. There we mistakes that were made, as said member in question was in their first term. However, I wish to put this aside, move forward with our progressive agenda. Both labor and the pirates were excellent coalition partners, however it is a truly socialist party government that would bring Australia into the future. We can continue our plans from last government, and move forward towards the referendum on the republic

Good evening Australia. Now I don't very much feel like throwing former coalition members under the bus, especially in light of all the good work we did together, so let's stick to the program a re-elected Socialist Government would focus on. We understand that economically, Australians are struggling. Cost of living is making ordinary families feel the pinch and wages are not rising as fast as we need them to. Now that many of our flagship social policies have been drafted or are, like the Republic, being implemented, we need to focus on economics. And step one needs to be rebuilding our unions which have been attacked consistently since the 1980s, so that Australian workers can take back control of the economy.

Thanks AMN. I'm running in this election because I believe that it's time we have real representation in Canberra, and a moderate voice to hold the Government to account. What we've seen in the last term was a total absence of any proper opposition. It's also interesting hearing the former Minister state that we need to focus on economics, considering that we've also seen the Socialists and Labor fail to submit a budget **twice** now. And, we've heard nothing from the opposition. If elected, I vow to hold the Government to account, whomever that may be. Also, if elected as an independent, I'll **stay** as an independent üòâ

Well it's a matter of building on previous work. We had a lot of excellent bills that the dissolving of parliament means won't be passed, which is a damn shame. But it also means a new focus. It's true that last term, there was no budget. But I'm sure you'll be happy to know that we were incredibly close to releasing one, so if we are re-elected it'll be much faster than previously. And that budget is going to be *beautiful,* believe me. Roads, schools, hospitals, you name it.

It‚Äôs time for Australia to rise up. It‚Äôs time for Australia to stand up against the Socialist‚Äôs higher taxes, hate for institutions and regulation. Higher taxes, hate and regulations will hurt - not benefit - Australians. THEY DESERVE BETTER. That‚Äôs where we come in. We‚Äôll introduce a budget in the first 3 weeks of our term. That is a commitment. We‚Äôll ensure that smart spending - not less or more - occurs so Australia grows. That is a commitment. But most importantly, we‚Äôll fight for middle Australia.

Well, we can't take Australia forward without first looking backwards. The past 3 governments have failed to provide a budget. We can't commit to spending if we are losing money hand over fist and there is physically no money left. I mean, by this point, the budget could be *points to the destroyed window* somewhere overthere. So, we first have to get a budget completed before we can spend any money to progress Australia.

My party will give Paramedics armour to protect from drunken attackers. A couple of weeks ago a paramedic in Melbourne was assaulted by two drunk women. The judge let them off because one of them had a mental illness, which brings me to another subject: Mental health. I will increase budgeting and staff for all Mental health services. But what about the other female suspect? She was let off because of "exceptional circumstances. I will also introduce programs to drive political correctness out of our society.

[20-May-18 07:26 PM] Hoog#6115
AustraliaSim faces challenges and changes in so many areas. Challenges for our economy and for our jobs; for the cities, suburbs and regions we live in; for our environment; for foreign affairs and trade; and for the health and education needs of our young, our adults and elderly. Our goal is to embrace the change that our nation needs to make it better, to preserve and grow our living standards and our security, to spread opportunity to those to whom it is currently denied, to never accept entrenched inequality, and to ensure the vulnerable are not left behind. Only Labor has the values and plans to build the AustraliaSim of the future. We are a *movement in service to the nation we love*, a country built on fairness, equality, justice and inclusion.

The government had been working towards achieving many of these goals and changes before this election was unfortunately called. One thing we were very close to achieving was inroads towards a transition to an Australian Republic, with an Australian Head of State, who can fully represent our traditions, values and aspirations as a nation. This continues to remain a Labor policy and we are committed to finding the correct road to take towards this goal. 

The economy of course remains important in our goals to make our nation better. AustraliaSim needs macro-economic policy to foster investment across the entire economy and ongoing reform and economic management to increase productivity, create good jobs and secure the future health of the Australian economy. This includes sector-by-sector measures to improve competitiveness, innovation and productivity. Modernising our infrastructure, managing the transition to clean energy, investing in skills and innovation and advancing tax reform are all necessary for AustraliaSim‚Äôs economy to grow in all Australians‚Äô interests.

Here's a very simple fact:

Posting three paragraphs of platitudes and repeating a blatant lie like "We will be a government of action!!!" aren't real action, it's simply grandstanding. 
To both @PineappleCrusher_ and @Hoog, I ask you a very simple uestion: 

Where is the policy?

Pineapple claims that their Government will have a budget in three weeks. What will be one thing they will repeal in their Budget? Who is, or will be, in charge of writing it?

I know it's very difficult for Liberal and Labour to actually do something besides spam buzzwords and vomit vapidity to the public, but please at least *try* to be specific, thanks.

[20-May-18 07:44 PM] Hoog#6115
We stand for integrity and transparency in government and honesty in Labor, with no tolerance for corruption. Our belief in prosperity is pragmatic, not dogmatic. Labor is a party of principle, not protest. We strive for government and we seek to be measured by our deeds, marshalling the energy of the nation to uplift the horizons and liberate the talents of the Australian people. A government that is strong and flexible, not brittle or rigid. We believe in the contribution of markets and the role of government.

Labor is a party of economic growth. We reject the arguments of those who do not believe in economic growth. This has always been essential to our agenda, ever since early Labor Governments‚Äô nation-building reforms and the creation of a genuinely national economy. Labor rejects the false choice between economic growth and equality. Excessive inequality detracts from economic growth and damages the social fabric. Economic growth should be inclusive of all.

Australia should vote for Labor because Labor governments have a track record throughout history of achieving great things in our nation. Where once Australia looked only inward, Labor offered a home to migrants whose cultures and traditions enrich us all. University education was once a privilege decided by wealth. Labor made it an opportunity earned on merit. For hundreds of thousands of families, illness or injury meant poverty, until Labor built Medicare. Millions of Australians worked hard all their lives only to retire poor, until Labor created universal superannuation. Our nation‚Äôs failure to face the dark shadow of our history diminished us all, until Labor said Sorry. I could go on and on, AMN.

Hello?


[20-May-18 08:02 PM] One Nation to Rule them All#9048
If you think about it, this debate is indicative of how exactly the parties would function in Government.

You've got Labor spamming walls of texts, but with no content in them whatsoever. This represents their hordes of press posts and bills that will *look* like it is helping Australia, but actually does nothing.

You've got the Liberals trying to get a few witty comments in. This shows that they're basically a clone of the Centre Alliance's Chad policies, but worse. Honestly, why vote them then?

You've got the Socs who post two lines whenever they are asked anything. This is also fairly reflective of a Socialist government - the amount of bills they will pass to help Australia will be the same as the amount of food you get under their regime.

There's the Australia Republic movement which is basically as irrelevant as the monarchy, because honestly who's been reading his answers anyway?

And finally you've got the CHAD Centre Alliance, who's been slaying the other parties left and right while also helping Australia. This is a VERY easy choice. Thanks and please clap

**Collapse of the Pirate Party**
Last night, founder of the Pirate Party, CircleSongIsDank, Pirate Party Senator, resigned from the party. He was elected last election, and this leaves the Pirates with a vacant senate seat. But then, the party's sole representation in the lower house- Scrubfungen, the Member for Batman and PM-ME-SPRINKLES, the party leader and Member for Melbourne, all simultaneously resigned. This has left the Pirates with seemingly no remaining leader, and it remains to see who will take the helm. There's the party's only parliamentarian, @Scrub, or former Greens senator @TheWhiteFerret, or maybe even @droniye‚úåüèº, who featured on our debate last night. The Pirate Party, however, faces a rocky future.

[21-May-18 09:14 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
We've got three fantastic candidates for Socialist leadership, even if one couldn't make it today. So it's a difficult decision for our party members to make. So I want to make sure everybody knows why I'm running. The Socialist Party must remain socialist. Youmaton is a great person, a phenomenal deputy leader, but I believe the aim of our party should still be socialism. Even though our manifesto is admittedly just a further left social democracy, we have to have that goal be the one we're working towards. One where the mines and offices are owned by the people who work there. It is a difficult path, but it's the path this party should walk.


[21-May-18 09:14 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Thank you very much! Now onto @Youmaton.


[21-May-18 09:17 AM] Youmaton#1190
The socialist party is an incredible party, with the people and power to change the nation. All three candidates we have are all worthy as leader in their own right, but I personally hope I can be the new leader, to bring the socs into the future. I hope to allow the socialist party to be more open to working across the board, to focus on a progressive agenda, and strive on a revamped left wing platform. It is together we are united, into the future.


[21-May-18 09:18 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. If you were to lead the party, would you shift the party's ideology and how? @LuSing My Religion


[21-May-18 09:21 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I think we've got a good program, and Bsharri was somebody who ultimately envisioned a socialist society, so I don't think it's much of an ideological shift as much as continuing his work. Obviously we won't just continue on exactly the same, and I think the manifesto could use a few revisions leftward, but largely the ideas would remain the same as now, I imagine.


[21-May-18 09:21 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright @Youmaton Would you shit the party's ideology, and if so, how?


[21-May-18 09:21 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
That meant to say shift...


[21-May-18 09:21 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Obviously..


[21-May-18 09:22 AM] Youmaton#1190
*giggles*


[21-May-18 09:23 AM] Youmaton#1190
I would keep the party where it is in the most part at the moment, we have an excellent platform that Bsharri helped to create, but we can go further. Obviously I would try to influence some social democracy into certain aspects, but I am happy with the majority of positions that we hold at the current time.


[21-May-18 09:24 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Would you seek a merger with the beleaguered Pirates? @LuSing My Religion


[21-May-18 09:26 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Perhaps. The Pirates were excellent coalition partners last term, and many of them would be great additions to the team. And it's true that the time of the Pirate Party is over, considering the collapse of their leadership. I'd wait to see who the new Pirate leader is before discussing a merger but in the mean time any members are free to join our party.


[21-May-18 09:29 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
As for you? @Youmaton


[21-May-18 09:36 AM] Youmaton#1190
I definately wouldnt be against it. As my friend here said, the pirates were incredible coalition partners last term, i would love to have them be a part of the socialist party. I look forward to hearing the results of the pirate leadership election, at the least I hope to strengthen the bond between our parties.


[21-May-18 09:37 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Speaking of coalition partners...who would you like to be your coalition partners in government? @LuSing My Religion


[21-May-18 09:39 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The ideal is a Socialist majority, but obviously that's a difficult path. The Pirates, if they're still around, are an obvious choice due to how often our values align. Labor seem cautious about another coalition but they bought a lot of great ideas and valuable skills to government last  time, so I wouldn't be opposed to working with them. And I hear there's a left-leaning independent who might be good for supply and confidence üòâ

We already did last term, when they introduced the Online Gambling Restriction bill. I'd be voting for any good legislation they bring forward. Although we obviously have very significant ideological differences that would make it hard to form any kind of government arrangement, but I wouldn't totally rule out negotiations. It depends on what they'd ask for.

pirate (2) 

[21-May-18 07:02 PM] Rat#1042
Well, I left the Pirates because I felt like, I didn't want to run the party, it was quite devastated by the loss of CSID and it had kinda turned into a meme party. Definitely not the type of party to form government


[21-May-18 07:03 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, why is it you chose the Socialists to join?


[21-May-18 07:04 PM] Rat#1042
I felt that my core belief system lined up with the Socialists. Of course, I do not agree with all their policies but the large majority of them I support such as giving power back to the people!


[21-May-18 07:05 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. Now, who do you think will be next Pirates leader? I've been helping to manage the nominations, but I can't publicly disclose anything.


[21-May-18 07:07 PM] Rat#1042
Well, I think that @Scrub as a member of parliament should be the next leader, however Grape will have some great ideas and bring change into the party.


[21-May-18 07:09 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. Now finally, who do you think will be the next **Socialists** leader?

The member for Fairfax has accused the former PM of calling him a ‚Äúself-righteous git.‚Äù


[30-May-18 07:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The member has claimed that he was told by Bsharri to ‚Äòget a f***ing life‚Äô, a violation of the Code of Conduct.


[30-May-18 07:03 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
He‚Äôs claimed it was the beginning of ‚Äòharassment by [Bsharri]‚Äô.


[30-May-18 07:07 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The Member goes on to state his actions (he does not specify which actions) were deemed by Bsharri as ‚Äòpathetic‚Äô, and was told to ‚Äòget a f***ing grip‚Äô, claiming this constitutes abusive actions and harassment.


[30-May-18 07:35 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The Honourable General Rommel has stated ‚Äúwhether something constitutes abuse should be examined objectively without considering the context‚Äù. As well as this, the member for Fairfax stated Bsharri called him ‚Äòbeyond f***ed‚Äô.

Australia Tonight will be predicting the notional election margins for seats. Please note these are not election predictions, however the presence of independents in Lingiari and Denison will be accounted for.


[31-May-18 06:27 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**SYDNEY**
Most likely a :labor: hold.


[31-May-18 06:28 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**WHITLAM**
:CA: gain from :liberal:.


[31-May-18 06:29 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**LYNE**

[31-May-18 06:29 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**GREENWAY**
Too close to call, but maybe a :socialist: gain from :liberal:?


[31-May-18 06:30 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

[31-May-18 06:32 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

[31-May-18 06:33 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**DENISON**
‚úã gain from :labor:.


[31-May-18 06:34 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**CANBERRA**
:labor: hold.


[31-May-18 06:35 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**KINGSTON**
Possibly a :CA: hold? If the Libs choose to back someone else, however, it could swing.


[31-May-18 06:37 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**PEARCE**
Shockingly, our data is showing that this seat that has been Socialist-held since its inception, is too close to call, however the :socialist: might just pull out.


[31-May-18 06:39 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**MELBOURNE**
Following the collapse of the Pirates, the :socialist: might just gain this seat from :pirate:.


[31-May-18 06:40 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**CHISHOLM**
This prediction is looking bad for Socialist leadership. Too close to call, however, once again, it will probably be a narrow :socialist: hold.


[31-May-18 06:41 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**GORTON**
:liberal: hold.


[31-May-18 06:41 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**BATMAN**
Too close to call. If they can nominate a candidate, perhaps a :pirate: hold?


[31-May-18 06:42 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**BRISBANE**
:socialist: gain from :liberal:.


[31-May-18 06:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**WRIGHT**
Too many independents to call, but perhaps a :socialist: hold? Who the hell knows.


[31-May-18 06:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Now, their odds look boosted.


[31-May-18 07:00 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We‚Äôll be predicting **Melbourne** as too close to call, with the Viking Party also playing a factor.


[31-May-18 07:00 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Batman** will be considered a safe Pirate seat.


[31-May-18 07:01 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

[31-May-18 07:06 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We‚Äôre just confirming the formation of the senate...


[31-May-18 07:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
As there is a leftist majority in the senate, it‚Äôs likely a renewed Socialist-Labor-Pirate coalition will occur.


[31-May-18 07:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
However, there could be a possible right-wing coalition of the Liberals, the CA, @djello, @AnswerMeNow2 and the Pirates.

Welcome to Australia Tonight's election prediction!

We'll be shaking things up a bit. Using a Cayman Islands bank (M: http://nub.international/#/, MHOC's non-canon bank), Australia Tonight will be offering betting stakes for the election. Stay tuned for more information at the end of the broadcast.


[01-Jun-18 04:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Shockingly, 10 electorates are uncontested, meaning we already have Sydney, Lyne, Bradfield, Lingiari, Denison, Gorton, Melbourne, Fairfax, Canberra and Chisholm decided.


[01-Jun-18 04:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
1 of these seats will go to the Socialists, 5 of these seats will go to the Liberals, 2 of these seats to independents, 1 of these seats to the Vikings and 1 seat to Labor.


[01-Jun-18 04:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
So, now time for 7 predictions!


[01-Jun-18 04:24 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**WHITLAM**
As predicted, this will probably be a :CA: gain from :liberal:.


[01-Jun-18 04:25 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**GREENWAY**
Too close to call and we won't even try.


[01-Jun-18 04:26 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**PEARCE**
Who better to challenge the Socialist deputy than the former Conservatives leader? Judging by our predictions, anyone. A :socialist: hold.


[01-Jun-18 04:27 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**BATMAN**
Judging by our predictions, the :socialist: will just edge out, gaining the seat from :pirate:.


[01-Jun-18 04:29 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**BRISBANE**
One of only two nation-wide three-way contests, Brisbane is too close to call, however, it might just swing to the :socialist:, becoming another gain from the beleaguered Pirates.


[01-Jun-18 04:33 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Welcome to Australia Tonight! Our exit poll is showing a tight race between the Liberals and the Socialists, with no other parties currently registering on the poll.


[03-Jun-18 10:15 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
However, voting independent is also a popular choice, especially with the rise of popular, well known independents, like @AnswerMeNow2 and @djello.

First, to Whitlam. Despite a campaign of memes, tbyrn21 looks set to win the simulated vote. We're going to predict 2 votes as going to tbyrn21, and the other 3 going to TheWhiteFerret. Thus, this will lead to a supplementary election.


[03-Jun-18 12:19 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Then, there's Greenway. TheSilentAsh looks set to easily gain the simulated vote, but we're predicting 4 votes will go to the Socialists and 1 to the Liberals, thus making this a :socialist: gain.

Pearce is the seat of the red flag, being held by bsharri and then Drunk_King_Robert. DKR will almost certainly take the simulated vote. But, we're predicting 3 voters will vote for JengaLucile, and 1 for DKR. The Centre Alliance vote will be crucial here- much of the support for the CA here comes from the Pirate Party, so the vote might swing towards DKR, forcing a supplementary election. That's our prediction. But if the Deputy Leader of the Socialist Party loses her seat to the former Conservative leader, it will clearly be a disappointing night for the Socialist Party.

Batman is where former Greens member and veteran politician phyllicanderer is up against Liberal candidate CB3CP3. We're not sure who will win the simulated vote, but we're leaning towards phyllicanderer- not that it makes a difference. With 3 votes for phyllicanderer and 1 vote for CB3CP3, the Socialists will easily hold this seat.


[03-Jun-18 12:37 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We also have Brisbane. With 3 candidates contesting- the Liberal Leafy_Emerald, the Socialist Nicky6Fingers and the Viking aloshn, this is made difficult. The simulated vote will probably swing to Nicky6Fingers due to the endorsement of fellow party members. About half of Brisbane is not partisan affiliated, so it is difficult to know whom they'll actually vote for. We're predicting 1 vote will go to the Socialists, 1 to the Vikings, and the other 2, we just don't know. If the two we haven't predicted don't vote, this will be a Socialist gain. However, if 1 of the unaffiliates votes and preferences the Vikings higher than the Socialists, it's a supplementary election. If any of the unaffiliates vote Socialist, they've won. If the unaffiliates all vote Liberal, it's a supplementary election. In conclusion? Too close to call.


[03-Jun-18 12:41 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, to Wright, which was the wrong region for a weariso..oh wait, I already made that joke. The competition is between Electrumms of the Centre Alliance and madama-liberte of the Labor Party, both two strong politicians. Neither has done much campaigning, so we don't know who will win the simmed vote. 2 voters will vote Labor, 1 will vote CA, and again, due to unaffiliates, we can't predict the other two. If the CA wants a chance at winning, they need to swing all unaffiliates- as just 1 unaffiliate voting Labor would mean a Labor win, or at the very least, a supplementary election.


[03-Jun-18 12:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Finally, we have Kingston- another three-way contest, between hk-laichar of the Centre Alliance, Viado_Celtru of the Liberals and PM-ME-SPRINKLES of the Socialists. The simulated vote will go to Sprinkles. 2 votes for Sprinkles, 1 vote for Viado_Celtru, and 2 unaffiliated. However the unaffiliated do not make a difference here. Either this will be a Socialist gain or a supplementary election. We're predicting the former. Kingston is a :socialist: gain.

Judging by this, the independents hold the balance of power. A Socialist-Labor-Viking government needs the support of either AnswerMeNow1 or dyljam, while a Liberal-CA government needs the support of both. However, the CA could elect to go with the now more moderate Socialists, thus  giving them a majority.


[03-Jun-18 05:57 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We have a few revisions to make. The simulated vote in Brisbane will be swinging to Leafy_Emerald, complicating the situation. This means that, if expected, 1 person votes Viking and another votes Socialist, will lead to a three-way supplementary election.  Wright's simmed vote will certainly go to Electrumms, meaning Wright is now too close to call.

Many campaigns have been caught up in arguments that divided the community, but none more then the centre point of the election, the electoral modifiers.


[04-Jun-18 07:24 AM] Youmaton#1190
As many know, parliament passed this new legislation which changed the game, allowing for the legalisation of campaign memes, but at a cost. They now had a 2% weight to them, and thus the chaos begun. As the Deputy Governor General himself stated "I don't understand this sim", candidates were quick to pump out memes of varying varieties.


[04-Jun-18 07:28 AM] Youmaton#1190
Some memes throughout the campaign were seen as ground breaking and comedic, whilst others were seen as effortless and purely existed the purpose of getting the modifier. Mid way through the election, both the former Prime Minister Bsharri and the former Labor frontbencher Gredsen found themselves united against the current electoral modifiers. After making many statements, members of the community came out in support of the movement to change the modifiers.


[04-Jun-18 07:32 AM] Youmaton#1190
Many have called for memes to be banned in their entirety, some have called for their modifiers removed, others have campaigned for memes to only get weight alongside strong campaigns. It certainly is an issue dividing the nation, within a campaign that is certain to go either way everything hangs in the balance. Neither major party has made any official positions on the matter, so only time will tell where this ends up.

The election results were very close to our prediction, but ultimately, one Socialist seat went to the Liberals, Whitlam went to the CA, Pearce did not go to a supplementary election, but ultimately to JengaLucile, and Brisbane went to the Socialists. The one seat that did go to inconclusive results? Kingston.


[04-Jun-18 03:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The total results are 7 Liberal, 3 Socialist, 2 Labor, 2 Independent, 1 CA, 1 Viking and 1 inconclusive.

Tensions have been shown within the liberal party, with newly elected Chisholm MP Woof breaking party lines recently. He said in a statement that Australia should "end centrelink", calling it a "waste of money, time and energy". Former senator and now Greenway MP Ash quickly released a statement distancing the Liberal Party from Woof's comments.

Starting things off, you have recently come out of political retirement after being selected by former Pirate Party leader CSID to replace his seat. You had previously made comments about not wishing to join a political party or run as an independent, what changed your mind?

Well, it was CSID's expression of faith in me... He announced public that he had endorsed me to take his seat after his resignation, I think because of our long history of cooperation. Looking back to our days in government together, myself as Prime Minister, him as Deputy, we shared a lot of the same vision. His party was falling back in terms of activity and passion, so he looked to someone he knew he could count on. I didn't want to let him or the voters down, so I did what I felt was the best thing to do, that being, join the Pirate Party, take that Sanet spot, and then initiate a rebrand to restore a lot of that old passion which had been lost. It's an exciting time for sure, and no doubt we'll see some big things from the PFC in the not to far away future.

Well I think the name really epitomises what we're all about: ensuring and expanding the freedoms of AustraliaSim and its citizens. There's a group in the Czech Republic of the same name, with many of the same causes, and so that's what brought it into our minds, but when you really settle on a name, you're actually thinking about how you are identifying yourselves as a party, and how the public are going to identify you. So we settled on this name that was really representative of what we stand for, and I think when you hear the name you immediately know exactly who we're hear to represent and why.

I touched on why I changed the name in my answer to the last question: it's about reinvigorating our members and supporters. We've had two leaders resign in quick succession, so the party was in a bit of a shambles. So I decided a full reboot was in order, to really indicate we're moving forward, letting the past be the past. And I think so far it's worked, there's been a lot of talks, a lot of expression of interest from several different people. It's been really positive.

Youve received quite a public backlash from certain members of the community, accusing you of stealing the pirate party's senate seat, which was elected under a left wing premise. What do you say in response to that?


[06-Jun-18 11:45 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think they've forgotten that my previous party worked very closely with the Pirate Party's former identity, being the Social Democrats. I mentioned how closely CSID and myself worked together, and indeed our parties were allied back then. So clearly my values and the values of the Pirate Party were a lot closer than some made us out to be. Our voters will remember these times so I'm not so concerned. We're a progressive party, quite socially liberal, I think it's inherent that a libertarian party be as such. Really the only thing that separated us were our economic ideas, which even then weren't too dissimilar... Certainly both CSID and myself all agreed on the same problems but had different solutions. But this, in comparison to all our similarities, is so minor... I was a supporter of the Pirate Party in the last election and I'm honoured to have led its reboot. And yeah, we're a lot more alike than people give us credit for.

Okay, Bellman, there has been talk about where you would ally yourself to. Given that you are the king maker in the senate, which side are you more likely to work with?


[06-Jun-18 11:59 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well economically, I'd say I'm much, *much* closer to the Liberal Party... I've talked about how closely CSID and myself worked, but I worked even closer with PineappleCrusher_, he was a great colleague of mine and much of what I achieved in the BUP and Liberty parties was done with a lot of cooperation between him and myself. We were really the backbone of those parties. Since my leaving the party, he has introduced a number of policies which I can't say I'm totally on board with, but that's to be expected. I'm not conservative in the way he is. But still I have a lot of respect for him and a number of my old colleagues who still remain in the Liberal Party. That said, I've spoken to even the Socialist party about a number of issues which we agreed upon in our recently released manifesto, and I'm confident we'll be able to work together on those areas, particularly on social policy. But, overall, I think we're much more likely to work with the Liberal Party, just because the other parties' economic policy is just too antonymic.


[06-Jun-18 12:02 PM] Youmaton#1190
Talking about your policies, what would you say your top policies are? What policies do you want to drive before the next senate election?


[06-Jun-18 12:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well, our ultimate goal would be to remove all economic responsibilities of government... But that will take many, many years to achieve, sadly. In terms of more immediate policies I would like to see enacted, I'd say... The abolition of marriage as a legal concept would be great to see, and I think is a workable policy we can get through, um, I think the removal of taxes on superannuation would be great, similarly the removal of alcohol and tobacco taxes... I think we could probably also dissolve the SBS.


[06-Jun-18 12:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But yes, obviously, I'd like to see all of my policies enacted in future, but some are much more long term goals, and these are a few of the ones I think we can recognise more immediately.

Last year we saw the whole debate between whether or not we should let same sex couples get married. But that whole question, to me, is so despicable. Why should *anyone* have to be 'let' to get married? The government should have no powers to give permission to people who want to get married. It's preposterous. And it's in our constitution! This is just one of many examples of where gross authoritarianism is ingrained in our system...
In the past, marriage was put in law to encourage couples to have children, back then it was only socially acceptable to fall pregnant if you were married. That simply isn't the case anymore. Marriage isn't about children and you needn't be married to have children. There are legal benefits, sure. In family court, determinations are made differently if a couple is married. BUT. We now have de facto couples as a legal concept. The court can recognise couples *without* this idea of a legally recognised marriage. Most of the rights married couples have are afforded to de facto couples, and it wouldn't take many amendments to negate any negative differences between the two.


[06-Jun-18 12:15 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So marriage as a legal concept is not only an overstepping of government into citizens' personal and private lives, but simply unnecessary in modern times.


[06-Jun-18 12:15 PM] Youmaton#1190

What do you mean?


[06-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Youmaton#1190
My apologies if i was unclear, would you be suggesting that all types of marriages both religious and civil be abolished?


[06-Jun-18 12:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, not at all. I'm a deeply religious man, I of course value marriage highly as a religious concept. I regard it highly as a social concept. But not as a legal concept. I think this is the most progressive opinion on marriage a person can hold. Without any legal definition, persons can define marriage how they please. Social individual freedom increases dramatically. As it is, religious marriage is entirely separate from legal marriage. I don't care if the Queen says I can get married or not, I only care if God recognises it. And others might not care if God recognises it but only care that they have the right to go out and declare themselves as married to whomever they wish. The PFC's policy enables this more than anything else ever has or will.


[06-Jun-18 12:25 PM] Youmaton#1190
Here is a question from twitter: "Bellman, why is tax theft and not blackmail"


[06-Jun-18 12:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
*chuckles*


[06-Jun-18 12:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Is that a serious question, or...?


[06-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
Apparently so


[06-Jun-18 12:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So you want me to answer it...?


[06-Jun-18 12:27 PM] Youmaton#1190
You are known for that phrase, I think the viewer is questioning that.


[06-Jun-18 12:27 PM] Youmaton#1190
Yes, please explain why you believe tax is theft, and be classified as a right of a government, as blackmail, or another form


[06-Jun-18 12:29 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok... well whether you call it blackmail or theft, both are criminal acts to anyone else and plainly immoral, so I don't think distinguishing those two really helps make my point clear. But as to why tax is theft, I always carry with me a diagram to explain this point:

[06-Jun-18 12:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok, so you can see in the diagram, that the above image displays voluntarily giving.


[06-Jun-18 12:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
There is no threat or violence or any abuse of authority.


[06-Jun-18 12:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And you see in the lower image, there is a man with the letters 'gov' on his chest. This is because he represents the government.


[06-Jun-18 12:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Now, listen closely, this is where it gets complex: He forcibly *takes* from the person on the left.


[06-Jun-18 12:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
i.e. he *steals* it


[06-Jun-18 12:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The man is forced to give the money over, lest he is met with violence.


[06-Jun-18 12:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This is theft.


[06-Jun-18 12:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Now, the government does the same thing with taxes. You work hard all year for money, money that *you earned*. You should be able to do as you please with said money, as is shown in the top image. Alas, the government *forces* you to pay taxes, or else you'll be thrown in prison, only for protecting what is rightfully yours.


[06-Jun-18 12:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Not too hard to understand, I hope.


[06-Jun-18 12:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
I understand that, I hope that answers the audience member's question.

Well taxing income is a disgrace, and, frankly, impractical. When we talk about taxing thinks like smoking and alcohol, we say that that is a means of reducing people's likelihood of engaging with them. And yet we talk like taxing work won't have the same effect! Studies suggest that it does, *especially* when we have a welfare system which allows people to live comfortably without working anyway. I said earlier that I would like to see small taxes go in the immediate future, such as the alcohol and tobacco taxes, and the tax on superannuation. My grand vision for taxation would be to cut all tax except for the tax on expenditure, that being the GST. The GST isn't perfect, and I wouldn't stick to exactly how it is currently, but myself and my party are not quite settled on the best system. Certainly a tax on expenditure is much more practical and moral than any form of income or revenue tax. In a perfect world I wouldn't even have the expenditure tax, but there are a few things which I think government needs to provide, such as police and military and judicial courts, which will require funding from somewhere... Perhaps we work out a system which allows for the abolition of even GST some day, but certainly in what future I can foresee, yeah, a minor expenditure tax is what we'll be relying on.

So to start off with, many have questioned your ideology, labelling you as a fascist and a staunch conservative. Could the viewers at home get your view on what your ideology is, and what you strive to achieve.


[06-Jun-18 06:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well It is true, I am a conservative and a capitalist

You comment you wish the government to be as small as possible, to what extent do you believe it should go. What services should the government be providing, and what roles should the market play in influencing society?


[06-Jun-18 06:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I believe that the Govt should not be owning and operating Universities and that we should close the Federal Education and Health Depts and give all of its responsibilities to the state


[06-Jun-18 06:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
By doing this, the State Govt can improve the services previously provided and adjust it for its specific states


[06-Jun-18 06:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Rather then a National Education Policy that might not work in some states or territories.


[06-Jun-18 06:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
But that is my opinion


[06-Jun-18 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Health and Education are very important, but are something that should be mandated by State and Territories, rather then the Federal Govt.


[06-Jun-18 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
We should attempt to cut the Govt as much as possible, saving millions for the taxpayer.


[06-Jun-18 06:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Less wages for MP, ending benefits and other helicopter perks

A quick reminder to all those on twitter, feel free to ask questions with the hashtag #australia-tonight!

You were originally flung into the spotlight after your public arguements with the leader of the Viking Party; Liam. Many controversial statements were said from both sides, however I wish to ask your true thoughts. Of course censored as this is tv, but what are your thoughts on the events that unfolded?


[06-Jun-18 06:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Liam was being a total prick to me, rude and disoderly behaviour that was not fit for an MP

According to recent statistics, nearly 40% of teenagers have tried drugs


[06-Jun-18 06:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
This number is disguntly high and in an attempt to combat this, I would introduce legislation increasing sentences for possessions of drugs and also introduce lessons that will teach students about the effects.


[06-Jun-18 06:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Another thing I would do, is that I would make it so those wishing to live here on a permanent basis would need to undergo rigorous background checks and examinitations


[06-Jun-18 06:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
To ensure we are getting the best people


[06-Jun-18 06:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
For instance, there will be mutiple exams on english for each portion; writing, grammar, reading and speaking, as well as History Exams, that will examine the persons knowledge of the country more extensively

I also believe in closing the Processing Centers and deporting the residents of the centres to their home countries or other countries willing to accept them. Regardless of why they are fleeing, they did not follow the right process and don't deserve to come here

Whilst yes there may be some poor people and such, they will receive adequate classes and knowledge to pass these tests

Onto energy, "What steps will his energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly, and minimising job losses for fossil power plant workers? "


[06-Jun-18 07:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will make sure that Australia continues its use of fossil fuels to power the country, allowing for cheap electricity


[06-Jun-18 07:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
I believe that whilst we should do more enviromently friendly, right now we just can't afford to do so


[06-Jun-18 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
If we continue to be enviromentally friendly, we make the Australian People pay more and more for their energy


[06-Jun-18 07:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
When there are cheaper alternatives, that keep jobs


[06-Jun-18 07:41 PM] Youmaton#1190
What are your thoughts on Climate Change, and should Australia do more to combat it?

If you could have any ministry within the new government, which ministry would you choose?

I would personally choose the Treasury or Defense

What message would you like to send out to the people of this country?


[06-Jun-18 07:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
That the Liberals and I want to cut spending and cut taxes


[06-Jun-18 07:56 PM] Youmaton#1190
Anything else you would like to comment about any policy, twitter comment, or other things relating to you and your thought?

Hello everyone, and welcome to Australia Tonight. Tonight is a special night, as the high court will be giving its findings on the seat of kingston, and we will find out if the liberal party will be able to form a government with solely the centre alliance, or if the population of kingston will be heading back to the ballot boxes.


[07-Jun-18 10:17 PM] Youmaton#1190
Please welcome our two guests


[07-Jun-18 10:17 PM] Youmaton#1190
Firstly, as youve already heard, we have the Socialist candidate for Kingston, Sprinkles!


[07-Jun-18 10:17 PM] Rat#1042
Hello Australia!


[07-Jun-18 10:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
We also have alongside us, new member for Greenway, Ash!


[07-Jun-18 10:18 PM] Ash#8178
Hello everyone


[07-Jun-18 10:19 PM] Youmaton#1190
Alrighty, lets get into this. What have your thoughts been on this latest election. Anything you wouldve changed, what things are you happy that you did?


[07-Jun-18 10:20 PM] Rat#1042
Well, I think that the allowance of memes in the electoral modifiers has been a disaster


[07-Jun-18 10:21 PM] Ash#8178
It's a great shame that most electorates were uncontested


[07-Jun-18 10:21 PM] Rat#1042
Agreed, Australians shouldn't get no say in who represents them.


[07-Jun-18 10:22 PM] Rat#1042
Even in areas where it's a safe seat, MPs should still have to be accountable and if there is no competition then voters can't vote for someone else


[07-Jun-18 10:22 PM] Ash#8178
agreed @Rat


[07-Jun-18 10:22 PM] Youmaton#1190
Lets get into that topic. How would you two change things to fix that problem?


[07-Jun-18 10:24 PM] Ash#8178
there need to be more people raising  up their hand


[07-Jun-18 10:24 PM] Rat#1042
Well, I have a bit of a controversial view on this, but I think the AEC should try to make electorates more marginal


[07-Jun-18 10:24 PM] Rat#1042
People didn't run because they felt that these seats did not stand a chance


[07-Jun-18 10:24 PM] Ash#8178
There is no simple fix @Youmaton


[07-Jun-18 10:25 PM] Ash#8178
The electorates should remain randomized in my opinion.


[07-Jun-18 10:25 PM] Ash#8178
It prevents any seat stacking


[07-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Rat#1042
Fair, however perhaps having multi member electorates would help

[07-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Rat#1042
Although that would be quite a change to the electoral system of Australia


[07-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
Indeed. In terms of memes, where do you two consider yourself when it comes to them in election campaigns?


[07-Jun-18 10:27 PM] Rat#1042
I honestly don't think that memes, while they're funny, hold to the type of democracy that we have.


[07-Jun-18 10:27 PM] Rat#1042
Voters should be voting based on policies not who can make the funniest meme

[07-Jun-18 10:27 PM] Ash#8178
to be fair, I have no strong opinion for or against them


[07-Jun-18 10:28 PM] Ash#8178
i occasionally used memes in my campaign


[07-Jun-18 10:28 PM] Rat#1042
I produced a meme during the campaign before I realised how silly it was.


[07-Jun-18 10:29 PM] Rat#1042
Perhaps we could instead use a single post as a competition which I heard a voter mention not long ago


[07-Jun-18 10:30 PM] Youmaton#1190
Interesting. Just a note to everyone watching at home, we have a livefeed in the bottom right of the screen showing our cameras outside the high court. At any time now they will be announcing their decision on the seat of Kingston.


[07-Jun-18 10:31 PM] Youmaton#1190
In terms of Kingston, what did you two think of the case, and how do you think itll be resolved?


[07-Jun-18 10:31 PM] Ash#8178
I don't know to be fair


[07-Jun-18 10:31 PM] Rat#1042
Well, it's anyones bet to how the HC will respond to this


[07-Jun-18 10:31 PM] Ash#8178
It could go both ways


[07-Jun-18 10:31 PM] Rat#1042
There are 3 options they can take.


[07-Jun-18 10:32 PM] Rat#1042
Either declare the election to me based upon the modifiers, to Viado_Celtru based on the ballots, or they could call a supplementary election.


[07-Jun-18 10:33 PM] Ash#8178
How will they conduct this supplementary election?


[07-Jun-18 10:33 PM] Rat#1042
Honestly, I'm not very sure


[07-Jun-18 10:33 PM] Ash#8178
There are no other electorates to be contested


[07-Jun-18 10:33 PM] Rat#1042
I guess it would come down to turnout


[07-Jun-18 10:34 PM] Ash#8178
It would be quite interesting to see if it happens


[07-Jun-18 10:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
Certainly


[07-Jun-18 10:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
Question to Ash, how is government planning going? What positions are you hoping for in the cabinet?


[07-Jun-18 10:35 PM] Ash#8178
Well I'm not hoping for any specific spot


[07-Jun-18 10:35 PM] Ash#8178
but i will be grateful to serve in any capacity


[07-Jun-18 10:36 PM] Ash#8178
but the government's planning is reaching it's last stages


[07-Jun-18 10:37 PM] Rat#1042
Do you have the support of any other parties @Ash ?


[07-Jun-18 10:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
That is certainly a good question


[07-Jun-18 10:37 PM] Ash#8178
No comment on that at the moment


[07-Jun-18 10:38 PM] Rat#1042
Well are you close to one?


[07-Jun-18 10:38 PM] Rat#1042
I think the voters ought to know about this


[07-Jun-18 10:38 PM] Ash#8178
You will find out when the cabinet will be released


[07-Jun-18 10:38 PM] Youmaton#1190
Better question, do you still have the support of the Centre Alliance?


[07-Jun-18 10:39 PM] Ash#8178
Well


[07-Jun-18 10:39 PM] Ash#8178
yes


[07-Jun-18 10:40 PM] Ash#8178
The CA will be our coalition partner


[07-Jun-18 10:41 PM] Rat#1042
So you DO have the support of other parties.


[07-Jun-18 10:41 PM] Ash#8178
No


[07-Jun-18 10:41 PM] Ash#8178
Well not yet


[07-Jun-18 10:42 PM] Rat#1042
You seem to backpedalling here because you just said you didnt have their support, then you did, and now you dont?


[07-Jun-18 10:43 PM] Ash#8178
?


[07-Jun-18 10:43 PM] Ash#8178
please explain


[07-Jun-18 10:43 PM] Rat#1042
I think for all intents and purposes, although I'm not a member of the Liberals, I think we can safely assume that they do have the support of the CA.


[07-Jun-18 10:43 PM] Ash#8178
Oh i seem to have misread that question


[07-Jun-18 10:44 PM] Rat#1042
@Youmaton Could you roll back the clip?


[07-Jun-18 10:44 PM] Ash#8178
Yes we do have support from other parties

Alrighty moving on, to the both of you, what do you two hope to bring to the parliament now that you are elected in Ash's case, and on the verge of being elected in Sprinkles case?


[07-Jun-18 10:46 PM] Ash#8178
I'll stand up for the people of greenway


[07-Jun-18 10:47 PM] Ash#8178
and i will represent my government


[07-Jun-18 10:48 PM] Rat#1042
If elected, I will seek to push that no matter what we continue to fund our education system with no cuts to it


[07-Jun-18 10:49 PM] Rat#1042
Our education system is the backbone of this country and I do not want to see our children suffer


[07-Jun-18 10:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
Fascinating


[07-Jun-18 10:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
Im hearing rumours that the verdict might be handed down soon, so we shall keep a close eye on that.


[07-Jun-18 10:51 PM] Rat#1042
Very well, we shall.

[07-Jun-18 10:53 PM] Youmaton#1190

[07-Jun-18 10:55 PM] Rat#1042
I would like to ask Ash about his planned budget


[07-Jun-18 10:56 PM] Rat#1042
Will you continue to fund the ABC?


[07-Jun-18 10:57 PM] Ash#8178
Of course we will continue to fund the ABC

{Reactions}
üá∏ üá¶ üá© ‚ùó 

[07-Jun-18 10:57 PM] Ash#8178
We will however merge the SBS with the ABC to maximise efficiency.


[07-Jun-18 10:58 PM] Youmaton#1190
Could you please elaborate on that? Would the ABC and SBS budgets be merged aswell?


[07-Jun-18 10:58 PM] Ash#8178
Yes the budgets will be merged


[07-Jun-18 10:59 PM] Youmaton#1190
Moreover, would there be a decrease in funding in comparison, or would the budget stay the same?


[07-Jun-18 11:00 PM] Ash#8178
There will be a slight decrease because the two networks overlap when it comes to content.


[07-Jun-18 11:02 PM] Youmaton#1190
You seem to be popular ash, you have a question from twitter


[07-Jun-18 11:04 PM] Ash#8178
We don‚Äôt see the need for two seperate national networks.


[07-Jun-18 11:04 PM] Ash#8178
They often overlap when it comes to content


[07-Jun-18 11:04 PM] Ash#8178
As I said


[07-Jun-18 11:05 PM] Youmaton#1190
Would you happen to have any questions for Sprinkles, Ash?


[07-Jun-18 11:05 PM] Ash#8178
Not right now


[07-Jun-18 11:06 PM] Ash#8178
But I will have some questions ready while in parliament.


[07-Jun-18 11:06 PM] Youmaton#1190
Oooo, any clues as to what they might be?


[07-Jun-18 11:07 PM] Ash#8178
not right now


[07-Jun-18 11:07 PM] Rat#1042
Any word from the High Court yet Youma?


[07-Jun-18 11:08 PM] Youmaton#1190
Not as of yet...


[07-Jun-18 11:09 PM] Rat#1042
So @Ash Woof has made quite a few comments that are quite extreme even for your party.


[07-Jun-18 11:09 PM] Rat#1042
Do you support many of his claims?


[07-Jun-18 11:10 PM] Ash#8178
I don‚Äôt support that much of his claims


[07-Jun-18 11:11 PM] Ash#8178
But I respect that he is giving out his personal views


[07-Jun-18 11:11 PM] Rat#1042
But he does represent your party.


[07-Jun-18 11:12 PM] Ash#8178
He is a member of the party


[07-Jun-18 11:12 PM] Rat#1042
And he was one the people who did not have an opponent on election day


[07-Jun-18 11:12 PM] Ash#8178
The party might not necessarily represent those views.


[07-Jun-18 11:13 PM] Ash#8178
But he is entitled to them


[07-Jun-18 11:14 PM] Rat#1042
I'm not saying he is entitled to him, but do you think that he has many other supporters in your party?


[07-Jun-18 11:14 PM] Rat#1042
As in people with similar views?


[07-Jun-18 11:14 PM] Ash#8178
Certainly not


[07-Jun-18 11:15 PM] Ash#8178
Certainly not his radical ideas


[07-Jun-18 11:16 PM] Rat#1042
So do you think that he is suited for you party considering no one else supports his quote 'radical'  ideas?


[07-Jun-18 11:17 PM] Ash#8178
I think he is suited to remain to the party


[07-Jun-18 11:17 PM] Ash#8178
Because he overwhelmingly supports our ideals


[07-Jun-18 11:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
Okay then, I think we will go to an ad break for a bit, however if there is any movement from the court we will come right back to tell you everything about it!


[07-Jun-18 11:23 PM] Youmaton#1190
BREAKING NEWS: The High Court has ruled that Kingston will be going to a supplementary election!


[07-Jun-18 11:25 PM] Youmaton#1190
Reasoning behind the decision will be released at a later date, but this is fresh out of the court. @Rat and @Ash what are your thoughts on this ruling?


[07-Jun-18 11:25 PM] Rat#1042
I think this is the fairest way to go about this


[07-Jun-18 11:28 PM] Youmaton#1190
*looks at ash, he seems to be asleep*

The most popular question was "What does the panelist think about @The Hon. Woof332 MP‚Äôs recent defection?"


[11-Jun-18 06:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I see no problem, considering he consulted his constituents and his party is not demanding a by-election.


[11-Jun-18 06:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Assuming his claims are true.


[11-Jun-18 06:54 PM] Youmaton#1190
That's a question to the people of Chisholm, are they happy with their MP?


[11-Jun-18 06:55 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I‚Äôd urge him to resign if they aren‚Äôt. I can provide evidence the majority of my constituents didn‚Äôt care or didn‚Äôt want me to resign.


[11-Jun-18 06:55 PM] Youmaton#1190
What does the panelist think about getting New Zealand back into the ANZUS alliance?


[11-Jun-18 06:56 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Let‚Äôs see if we want to stay in ANZUS before roping someone else in.


[11-Jun-18 06:56 PM] Youmaton#1190
Is that hinting at the greens wishing to leave the alliance?


[11-Jun-18 06:57 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I personally am not in favour of it.


[11-Jun-18 06:57 PM] Youmaton#1190

Except I tend to go by Future Senator DKR


[13-Jun-18 08:56 PM] Youmaton#1190
First up we have this question "what does the panel think of the court case re: woof and the cases presented #australia-tonight"


[13-Jun-18 08:58 PM] Rat#1042
However, I do have to say, if this case does happen to be thrown out, it would create quite a precedent


[13-Jun-18 08:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That is something to be noted there @Rat


[13-Jun-18 08:59 PM] Rat#1042
It would open up the ability for members to call out for genocides and for it to be considered 'okay' under the law


[13-Jun-18 09:00 PM] Rat#1042
I personally think that while I don't think that Woof has broken any laws, I do believe that some legislative change has to happen to prevent people from saying stuff like that without repercussions.


[13-Jun-18 09:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I've not had the opportunity to follow the arguments presented in the woof case very closely, but it has to be said his comments are beyond despicable and I hope the opportunity comes soon for his electorate to kick him out and have a decent MP representing them.


[13-Jun-18 09:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Is it possible a reinstatement of an ammended 18c of the RDA should be considered?


[13-Jun-18 09:00 PM] Youmaton#1190
If i may


[13-Jun-18 09:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The Racial Rights Bill, as introduced by the Socialist Party last parliament, should absolutely be reintroduced and passed.


[13-Jun-18 09:01 PM] Youmaton#1190
Was about to mention that. Just reminding the panel that there is a bill sitting in the senate at the moment after passing the last house that seeks to reinstate 18c


[13-Jun-18 09:01 PM] Youmaton#1190
Please continue


[13-Jun-18 09:02 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The case highlights the need for it. To have no punishment for calling for the death of literally millions of people is just obscene.


[13-Jun-18 09:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I see woof winning this case, but parliament seeking to change the law as it is glaringly obvious change is needed


[13-Jun-18 09:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
unless Rommel presses the part about does the CoC affect the constitution regarding meta


[13-Jun-18 09:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
wasn't woof elected unnopposed?


[13-Jun-18 09:04 PM] Youmaton#1190
*checks computer*


[13-Jun-18 09:04 PM] Youmaton#1190
Correct, he was elected unopposed


[13-Jun-18 09:04 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Perhaps the Liberal Party made a mistake in running him in the first place. It's abundantly clear he's not ready for Parliament.


[13-Jun-18 09:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I cannot deny that it seemed like a rushed decision; however, he could turn out to be a great pollie


[13-Jun-18 09:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*is he dead*


[13-Jun-18 09:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[13-Jun-18 09:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
Alrighty, on to a related question


[13-Jun-18 09:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
"In light of the recent controversy (the court case and his comments) as well as the calls for him to step down (such as in his poll on today tonight) do you think that Woof should consider stepping down? #australia-tonight"


[13-Jun-18 09:07 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Yes


[13-Jun-18 09:07 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And by consider, I mean he should.


[13-Jun-18 09:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

I'm glad that they dropped the socialist name. It was attracting the wrong kind of people who weren't serious. I welcome the move made by the party


[13-Jun-18 09:12 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Excuse me?


[13-Jun-18 09:12 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
What kind of people do you mean by that?


[13-Jun-18 09:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There were people who were being rude and offensive who were using socialism as the abstract for communism


[13-Jun-18 09:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
they were too radical for even the real Labour party


[13-Jun-18 09:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

[13-Jun-18 09:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
regardless of my motivations for it, I welcome the change


[13-Jun-18 09:14 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
We encompass all kinds of people, but our policies are angled with the main goal of protecting the workers of Australia.


[13-Jun-18 09:14 PM] Rat#1042
May I just interject here


[13-Jun-18 09:14 PM] Youmaton#1190
Go ahead


[13-Jun-18 09:14 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And not just the workers, but the life they live in too, and that means having a strong policy on the environment, on public transport, on health and education.


[13-Jun-18 09:14 PM] Rat#1042
We at the Labour Party are working on making the party much more open than the previous Socialist Party


[13-Jun-18 09:15 PM] Rat#1042
Already I can confirm, we are soon to release a constitution that will create a more representative party for the different views.


[13-Jun-18 09:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I welcome this news


[13-Jun-18 09:16 PM] Rat#1042
The aim of the party is to have a party that will be a united front of the left wing side of Australian politics without having to fight other parties.


[13-Jun-18 09:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
To sum it up, we're a really good party.


[13-Jun-18 09:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
More socialists should join us though, it's a bit lonely in the Socialist Left faction.


[13-Jun-18 09:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
On the topic of the general left, what does the panel think about the greens being reborn recently?


[13-Jun-18 09:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I am worried. My views do clash with several of the green's; however, I respect the opinions they have


[13-Jun-18 09:20 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Disappointing to be perfectly honest. The announcement from AMN about the formation of the party seemed to portray an image of a party beholden to the ideal of compromise, which is just silly. Compromise is a tool but should never be your aim. It should always be the aim of a party to implement its policies. If you tell people you plan to compromise, you'll get killed at the negotiating table.  Trust me folks, deals are my art form üëå


[13-Jun-18 09:21 PM] Youmaton#1190
Alrighty, weve just heard news from MP Woof.


[13-Jun-18 09:21 PM] Youmaton#1190
"Member for Chisholm, Woof332 will be introducing a private members bill on a future date to make our schools safer, Schools across the country have been recently targetted by the drug epidemic and the growing violence in these schools, it therefore essential that this private members bill be affirmed by parliament, this bill will allow for harsher penalties for students who bring weaponry or drugs onto school grounds liable to detention in Juvenile Facilities or be sent to Behaviour School. It will also result in the student being immediatly expelled from said school and banned from the Public School System (with the exception of behaviour schools and schooling in juvenile detention) for a minium period of 6 months to a maxmium period of 3 years. This bill will only apply to state run schools."

you cannot restrict a student from schooling


[13-Jun-18 09:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it would violate UN charters


[13-Jun-18 09:22 PM] Rat#1042
Additionally, why will this bill only apply to public schools?


[13-Jun-18 09:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
because we have less authority over private schools


[13-Jun-18 09:23 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
How many times do we have to relearn the lesson that punishment is not a viable way to prevent drug related crimes? What's with this mad idea that we can just throw somebody into prison for bringing some drugs to school, and then everything will be OK?

[13-Jun-18 09:25 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Penalties do not work. Rehabilitation works. Will we ever stop to ask the question of why students feel the need to turn to drugs in the first place?

An important aspect of this is *who* is being taxed. For example, company taxes are taxes on income that's already stolen. Surplus value is theft, plain and simple, so the government is merely reclaiming some of that for the workers who make up society (which we live in). But the taxing of workers, who already have their money ripped from their pockets with every paycheck? That's immoral.


[13-Jun-18 09:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
You can argue over whether it should exist in society, whether it's necessary or helpful, whatever


[13-Jun-18 09:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[16-Jun-18 01:04 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. One of the legal cases on everyone's mouth is AnswerMeNow1 v Woof332. Do you think the defendant's actions are prosecutable?


[16-Jun-18 01:05 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We'll start with @High Priest Liam.


[16-Jun-18 01:06 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Oh, also, @NotGriffonomics had to go, so he won't be on.


[16-Jun-18 01:06 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
I don't know honestly. I'm looking forward to seeing what the Judiciary comes up with at the end. I'd like to see a precedent set. His actions were abhorrent, but if they were prosecutable, I simply cannot say.


[16-Jun-18 01:06 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
Bye


[16-Jun-18 01:06 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
@NotGriffonomics bye


[16-Jun-18 01:07 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now onto you. @droniye‚úåüèº What's your opinion?


[16-Jun-18 01:08 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
I think that his actions are prosecutable as hate speech, no matter what, is still hate speech.


[16-Jun-18 01:09 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
Although there are no prominent Turk members of the Sim, it is still an act of discrimination.

Alright, @LuSing My Religion, what's your take on the issue?


[16-Jun-18 01:10 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
While I'm not exactly known as a legal mind, Woof did indeed threaten a member of the sim, even if indirectly. Whether or not the Judiciary decides to charge him for that we'll see, but it's clear we need to restore Section 18C


[16-Jun-18 01:10 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
@High Priest Liam a correction here. Aloshn is of Turkish ethnicity.


[16-Jun-18 01:11 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
@Shrub What do you think?


[16-Jun-18 01:12 PM] Shrub#2503
I think that some of his actions are prosecutable, however I agree with @LuSing My Religion in that we need reform on what kind of language is allowed on this sim. Such despicable threats should be banned from the sim regardless of whether or not it directly targets a member.

[16-Jun-18 01:15 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, now on to the Racial Rights bill. With a mixture of MPs and non-MPs- and the author of the bill here- as well as the influence this will have on AnswerMeNow1 v Woof332, let's talk about it. @High Priest Liam Could you explain its purpose and why it's needed, in your opinion?


[16-Jun-18 01:19 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
I made the bill during last government. (Is this canon or meta?)


[16-Jun-18 01:22 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
I put forward this bill because all people need protecting from hate speech. Calls for genocide should not be tolerated, religious defamation should not be tolerated and the harassment of people for being who they are should. not. be. tolerated. You have the right to your opinion, but when your opinion puts other people in danger, its not one worth sharing.


[16-Jun-18 01:24 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. @droniye‚úåüèº What's your opinion on the bill?


[16-Jun-18 01:32 PM] droniye‚úåüèº#0948
I think that swearing should be tolerated, but not racial slurs.


[16-Jun-18 01:34 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
@LuSing My Religion What do you think?


[16-Jun-18 01:36 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Brining back 18C and 18D is vital, these calls for genocide are totally unacceptable. We're here to debate policy, and our discourse isn't served any better by allowing blatant racism.


[16-Jun-18 01:36 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
@Shrub What do you think of the bill?


[16-Jun-18 01:38 PM] Shrub#2503
I think that it is clear that we need to reinstate sections 18C and D given the recent comments from Woof332, racism and calls for genocide don't belong in our society.


[16-Jun-18 01:40 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
If the bill passes while AnswerMeNow1 v Woof332 is still ongoing, should Woof be prosecuted?


[16-Jun-18 01:40 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
@High Priest Liam


[16-Jun-18 01:43 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Again, I don't know, its not my right to say, the court will have to take it into account of course. But I do not even think the bill will go through. The Liberal Party needs to protect its right to be racist after all.

Looks like HK left, we'll move onto @LuSing My Religion.


[16-Jun-18 01:46 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I'd leave this question to the court. Although obviously I don't think he should be punished for a crime that didn't exist at the time.


[16-Jun-18 01:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
@Shrub What do you think?


[16-Jun-18 01:50 PM] Shrub#2503
I think that the extent of his comments were clearly intended to insult and make members of the sim uncomfortable, so I think that he should be able to be sufficiently prosecuted under current law, and I don't believe we should subject him to laws that didn't exist at the time. However, I believe that in the future we need better and clearer provisions to punish comments such as his.


[16-Jun-18 01:51 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, as we have no more questions, that's all for now.

Hello all, and welcome to Australia Tonight.


[24-Jun-18 07:13 PM] Youmaton#1190
Tonight we have a special guest. He was deputy prime minister under the Bellman government, then swapped sides after forming the pirate party to help elect the Bsharri Government. Recently he took a health holiday, but he is back. Please welcome, @waltor

I feel far less stressed now and able to cope without breaking down in diarrhea daily.

Well yes there are some controversial figures in there, but they seem to be coming along adequately.


[24-Jun-18 07:19 PM] waltor#3519
On both sides.


[24-Jun-18 07:19 PM] Youmaton#1190

[24-Jun-18 07:22 PM] waltor#3519
Good to see Bellman turned up and fought, despite getting ejected.


[24-Jun-18 07:22 PM] waltor#3519
More importantly the MP known as "woof" seemed to cause quite a ruckus.


[24-Jun-18 07:22 PM] Youmaton#1190
Please elaborate.


[24-Jun-18 07:25 PM] waltor#3519
Well the little shite decided it was a good idea to attempt to murder somebody, and then proceeded to burn down Parliament. Then he goes back and sneakily edits the message expecting the Hansard to not have recorded them down. A fucking disgrace of a parliamentarian, and no surprise he only fucking got elected because no one else ran. Makes me in my early parliamentary days look like a professional. A fucking disgrace.


[24-Jun-18 07:25 PM] waltor#3519
And jumping parties just after elections is dodgy as well.


[24-Jun-18 07:26 PM] waltor#3519
Tumour on the Australian democracy.


[24-Jun-18 07:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
Anything else you wish to say on that?


[24-Jun-18 07:27 PM] waltor#3519
Resign you incompetent egg.


[24-Jun-18 07:28 PM] Youmaton#1190
Well, you certainly have a strong opinion on that. Relating to his party however, what do you think of the successor of the your pirate party, the Party of Free Citizens?


[24-Jun-18 07:29 PM] waltor#3519
It's good to see Bellman actually standing up for the people he was elected by, unlike woof, but I'm still not entirely sure what I think of the succeeding party to the Pirates. Happy to see that Bellman is promoting lower-income tax cuts.


[24-Jun-18 07:30 PM] Youmaton#1190
Do you have any comments in relation to those accusing bellman of stealing your former senate seat from your party?


[24-Jun-18 07:31 PM] waltor#3519
I did appoint him as successor so I hardly see it as stolen. I do hope Bellman stands up a little bit more for Pirate ideals that his seat was elected on i.e. abolishing data retention laws and reforming tax.


[24-Jun-18 07:32 PM] Youmaton#1190
Interesting. To other parts of politics, what is your opinion on the current government and opposition?


[24-Jun-18 07:33 PM] waltor#3519
The current government seems quite disorganised but I do hope they eventually do something.


[24-Jun-18 07:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
And the opposition?


[24-Jun-18 07:34 PM] waltor#3519
The opposition seems OK as well, and definitely more appealing to me as a left-wing person.


[24-Jun-18 07:35 PM] Youmaton#1190
Interesting. Away from politics now, what are your current plans. Do you plan on becoming a clerk, a lobbyist, a justice? What do you plan on doing?


[24-Jun-18 07:35 PM] waltor#3519
After talking to parliamentary officers I have indicated my interest in becoming a clerk, so I will probably be one.


[24-Jun-18 07:36 PM] waltor#3519
I'll still remain politically active, commentating on stuff, but I will remain impartial as Clerk.


[24-Jun-18 07:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
Do you have any messages to send to the people of Australia?

Last night, my wife and my young daughter Kira tuned in to #today-tonight. We are shocked at the attacks on Liam, and especially on Senator MattMonti, who is now struggling to raise a family by himself following the departure of his soul mate and husband. Losing someone like that is hard on its own, but #today-tonight has made it much worse. We here at Australia Tonight wholeheartedly condemn the words of Woof last night. Thank you.

[26-Jun-18 06:11 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
You know what I mean.


[26-Jun-18 06:11 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Yes I do


[26-Jun-18 06:12 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I think it just a cheap attempt at trying to silence me. Woof knows what he did was wrong and instead of apologising, he has decided to file a CoC. Shameful really.


[26-Jun-18 06:13 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, now onto more pleasant things. What‚Äôs next in your political career? Do you plan to once again run for the Senate, or launch a bid for a lower house seat?


[26-Jun-18 06:14 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I am going to continue in the senate. I believe that after my time in lower house, I can now safely say to Upper house is a better fit for me.


[26-Jun-18 06:15 PM] Matt Monti#4771
However, I am of course subject to changing times. Should my party need me to run in the lower house, I shall do so.


[26-Jun-18 06:16 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, let‚Äôs say the opposition wins back Melbourne and 3 senate seats. Would you block supply from the Liberal government in this case?


[26-Jun-18 06:17 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I am personally not going to 'block' anything. I will vote on bills like a senator should. If I think a Liberal Government bill is good and will help the people of Australia, I will vote for it! If not, I wont! It's that simple.


[26-Jun-18 06:18 PM] Matt Monti#4771
However I will admit that would probably lead me to vote NO on majority of Government bills.


[26-Jun-18 06:18 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What do you think of Woof332 MP‚Äôs acts of generosity, calling for an increase in public education funding and donating his salary to charitable groups?


[26-Jun-18 06:21 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I'm glad you asked actually. Whilst I am very, very thankful and happy to see Woof calling for increases to education funding and donating his salary, it doesn't drastically change my views on him. Bad people can do some good things. There are matters where we all agree on what do because it's 'the right thing to do'. But I personally believe this may be an attempt to improve his public image going into the CoC.


[26-Jun-18 06:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Speaking of CoC cases, what do you think of *AnswerMeNow1 v Woof332*? How do you think the court will rule here?


[26-Jun-18 06:24 PM] Matt Monti#4771
At this point my gut feeling is to always bet against Woof. I'm not familiar with the specifics of this case, but woofs history of pointless CoC cases will affect the outcome of this case.


[26-Jun-18 06:25 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I‚Äôll explain further. AnswerMeNow1 is suing Woof332 for abuse involving racism towards Turks, including statements such as ‚Äòdeath to the Turk roaches‚Äô.


[26-Jun-18 06:25 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Of course.


[26-Jun-18 06:26 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Well, having witnessed that event, I think the evidence is overwhelmingly in AMN's favour. For me the only question is how bad Woof's punishment will be.


[26-Jun-18 06:28 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, do you have anything else you wish to say, Senator MattMonti?


[26-Jun-18 06:29 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I'd like to thank #australia-tonight for their kind words of support for me and my family during this terrible time. From the bottom of my heart, thank you all so much.

[08-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
There seems to be no incentive to campaign more then once a day with current electoral laws, considering the simulated vote. What do you all think could solve this? Would any of you be for creating fully simmed elections, such as being tested by some of our neighbouring countries who come alongside us within the United Nations?


[08-Jul-18 08:18 PM] waltor#3519
Fully simmed elections are bad. They take the humanity out of elections.

Periodic Voter randomisation has proven effectivr


[08-Jul-18 08:20 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
people need better options


[08-Jul-18 08:20 PM] waltor#3519
Perhaps stricter voting laws.


[08-Jul-18 08:20 PM] waltor#3519
Maybe to run or vote you have to have shown some activity.


[08-Jul-18 08:20 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
I think we just need to get people to run for more offices


[08-Jul-18 08:20 PM] waltor#3519

[09-Jul-18 08:45 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Are you referring to the STV system?


[09-Jul-18 08:45 PM] Youmaton#1190
Im referring to our system of simulated voters

Ah, OK.


[09-Jul-18 08:46 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I think it's working to find a balance. We're on our way to community standards and finding the mix of the most fun, and the most activity encouraging. I like it, I know I oppose any more than a 50% simulated vote, but we're really doing well. We just need to refine our modifers


[09-Jul-18 08:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I fully support it, and believe like so many other nations, we should make the switch to fully simmed votimg.

[09-Jul-18 09:07 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
In my opinion, you catch more flies with manure than honey- modifiers that give you a worse campaign will basically ensure the abolition of memes. Although, we probably should clarify what counts as a meme...

[09-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Youmaton#1190
What about adding more population? Would that get people more active? Would allowing people to still vote, but realistically they are one vote within an electorate?


[09-Jul-18 09:21 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
just give everyone a seat and dont have elections


[09-Jul-18 09:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
allows our numbers to be higher and encourages growth


[09-Jul-18 09:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
failing that, full sim so we can have more seats


[09-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Ash#8178
If we fully sim the elections, it will somehow skyrocket the population


[09-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Ash#8178
For no apparent reason


[09-Jul-18 09:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
basically, these are rookie numbers


[09-Jul-18 09:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you gotta pump those numbers man


[09-Jul-18 09:23 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
new zealand had a what?


[09-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Youmaton#1190

[09-Jul-18 09:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the topic sucks


[09-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Youmaton#1190
Simmed elections. If you had a choice between full sim or no sim which would you pick


[09-Jul-18 09:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
full sim


[09-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Ash#8178
Full sim


[09-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Ash#8178
All the way


[09-Jul-18 09:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
i want to be MP for wentworth

[09-Jul-18 09:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
cause thats my idea of a meme


[09-Jul-18 09:28 PM] Matt Monti#4771
full sim


[09-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I'd rather go with partially simmed


[09-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Matt Monti#4771
but all simmed is better than none


[09-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Youmaton#1190
It's all based on modifiers I believe


[09-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Ash#8178
It‚Äôs not


[09-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Youmaton#1190
Some seats are set to be quite supportive based on ideology

Welcome back


[09-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Youmaton#1190
We have a very special guest right now to explain the new Zealand electoral systwm


[09-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Youmaton#1190
Please welcome @FTMP!


[09-Jul-18 09:43 PM] FTMP#7284
Hello


[09-Jul-18 09:44 PM] Youmaton#1190
Glad to have you on the show. Could you please go through what MNZP does when running it's elections?


[09-Jul-18 09:44 PM] FTMP#7284
As some of you may be aware, MNZP elections are entirely simulated


[09-Jul-18 09:45 PM] FTMP#7284
The most important aspect of this is campaign posts


[09-Jul-18 09:45 PM] FTMP#7284
but nearly every canon aspect of the simulation is considered for "modifiers"


[09-Jul-18 09:46 PM] FTMP#7284
The performance of the government and opposition, activity in debate and communication with the public through the press all contribute to personal, party and coalition modifiers


[09-Jul-18 09:48 PM] Youmaton#1190
How are posts weighed?


[09-Jul-18 09:48 PM] FTMP#7284
Posts, as well as things such as Minister's Questions are all marked for their quality


[09-Jul-18 09:49 PM] FTMP#7284
Particularly for campaign posts, the quality is a very important aspect, to the extent where one high quality post can be worth several low quality ones


[09-Jul-18 09:50 PM] FTMP#7284
Also considered is the type of posts, campaign posts are worth different amounts based on whether they're a bumper sticker or billboard or school visit


[09-Jul-18 09:51 PM] Youmaton#1190
Lastly for tonight, I've noticed seats start off leaning to a particular side. What determines that?


[09-Jul-18 09:51 PM] FTMP#7284
Our electorates begin with "leanings" these are a basis from which we produce electorate results


[09-Jul-18 09:52 PM] FTMP#7284
the leanings are a combination of real life data on how electorates "lean" as well as previous sim elections


[09-Jul-18 09:52 PM] FTMP#7284
it helps preserve realistic electorate results while giving some room for deviation


[09-Jul-18 09:53 PM] FTMP#7284
the leanings are combined with current polling to produce party support in each electorate


[09-Jul-18 09:54 PM] Youmaton#1190
Interesting, any last comments before you head off?


[09-Jul-18 09:55 PM] FTMP#7284
The last thing I could say is that simulated elections create an extra layer of immersion


[09-Jul-18 09:55 PM] FTMP#7284
every action in MNZP connects back to New Zealand


[09-Jul-18 09:57 PM] FTMP#7284
parties an MPs are encouraged to consider their decisions because they always feed back into the simmed election


[09-Jul-18 09:58 PM] Youmaton#1190
Certainly something that will create a lot of conversation when people watch. Thank you for joining me FTMP


[09-Jul-18 09:59 PM] FTMP#7284
It's good to be able to help


[09-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Youmaton#1190
Hope to see you back here on Wednesday, take care!

Very well Youma, how are you?


[12-Jul-18 05:02 PM] Youmaton#1190
Quite well.


[12-Jul-18 05:03 PM] Youmaton#1190
First of all, what made you decide to come back into the public political sphere?


[12-Jul-18 05:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Well, I was never too keen on leaving in the first place, but with personal issues and the fact my good friend DKR wouldn't be in Parliament if someone didnt give up a seat for her, I decided she would be much better in my senate seat than I would
I also felt that I needed an out from a major party and that I had to help give an independent voice in Parliament, but felt it would be unfair if I did so off the back off a Socialist ticket, so I came down and ran in Melbourne and now I'm running here


[12-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
Interesting, what policies are you hoping to being to the Senate?


[12-Jul-18 05:14 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Well, over the coming weeks I'll be announcing more and more, but essentially I want to make this country a force on the world stage diplomatically, fight for equal rights socially and economically use the free market as a tool to help the poor and underprivileged in our society and to use regulation of the market not to clamp down on it, but to direct it towards where it needs to be. If you're gardening and your hose is turned on but its pointing at the wall, Is not the best thing to point it at the unwatered part of your garden?
No! says Labour, you turn it down
No! say Liberals, you let it spray at the wall and hope some of the splash hits a plant
I say, YES


[12-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Youmaton#1190
Unique analogy. You were known for your interest in defence in the socialist party, what ideas do you have for this area?


[12-Jul-18 05:20 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Well as I said, Diplomatically we need to be more involved in global affairs and be more influential, and a key part of that is defence. I'm for solutions that increase our countries capabilities while saving the taxpayer some money if I can, literally getting Australians more bang for their buck. I have a couple of ideas on this subject, a few deal alterations and some negotiations with allied countries, but I think a CM-led government might be able to comfortably dispel our security concerns vis a vis other powers strength comparative to ours.


[12-Jul-18 05:21 PM] Youmaton#1190
Lastly, what would your demands be to those wishing to involve you in a coalition?


[12-Jul-18 05:25 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Make me Prime Minister, its sort of my schtick in this campaign. At the very least MoD. That and don't expect me to screw over anybody or to follow you blindly on legislation, if i think its going to do more harm than good I wont vote for it, even if it's a coalition partner's bill. I think that pretty much sums up my demands. I have a higher calling than coalition deals and alliances so don't expect me to backflip on something I promised my voters, which includes me in the Lodge by the way.


[12-Jul-18 05:29 PM] Youmaton#1190
Alright, that's all we have time for tonight

[15-Jul-18 11:04 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Hello to everyone!


[15-Jul-18 11:06 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright. With Deladi0 having been disqualified from the senate, we face the possibility of no centrist senators. Thoughts?


[15-Jul-18 11:07 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It is a very sad prospect for us here in the CA. We are disappointed that the AEC didn't warn us that this may occur, and didn't better advertise the registration.


[15-Jul-18 11:08 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Piss off, it's not the AEC's responsibility to come door knocking to tell you to enrol.


[15-Jul-18 11:09 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Deladi0 is an established candidate. He has no excuses. He knows the ropes. The rules are clear.


[15-Jul-18 11:09 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I can't defend that Deladi0 didn't enrol, but it is an incredibly confusing process of when to enrol and when not to enrol, surely you must accept that.


[15-Jul-18 11:09 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Not really.


[15-Jul-18 11:10 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's really very simple: if you are voting, enrol.


[15-Jul-18 11:10 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Easy.


[15-Jul-18 11:10 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But where to enrol? How? When? the AEC do a terirble job of communicating this info


[15-Jul-18 11:10 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm actually kinda glad this happened. A candidate who doesn't even have enough dedication to enrol? Please. Seems like a waste of space in an already fairly useless parliament.


[15-Jul-18 11:10 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Infact, polls had been open 4 hours until the AEC advertised it


[15-Jul-18 11:11 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hey tbyrn.


[15-Jul-18 11:11 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
You managed it.


[15-Jul-18 11:11 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Why did Deladi0's party leader not pass this info on?


[15-Jul-18 11:11 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Sounds like you are as much to blame as anyone.


[15-Jul-18 11:11 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I was of the impression he was


[15-Jul-18 11:11 AM] Youmaton#1190
Honestly, internal party procedures should have checked that he had enrolled. They had already previously advertised the election, its common knowledge that you have to enrol. That being said, it is sad that we will not be seeing him around.


[15-Jul-18 11:11 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
as if not he would have been thrown out earlier


[15-Jul-18 11:12 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Lmao.


[15-Jul-18 11:12 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Murphy's law, friend.


[15-Jul-18 11:12 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I accept that we failed, but the AEC also needs to better their system for this


[15-Jul-18 11:12 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I don't think so.


[15-Jul-18 11:12 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Literally everyone else managed it.


[15-Jul-18 11:12 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
this is a classic murphys law example, sadly


[15-Jul-18 11:12 AM] Youmaton#1190
Well, except Ganderloin!


[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think this is just another indication of the CA's dwindling dedicatoin.


[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There was also a Liberal thrown out


[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Although I suppose a lack of conviction is only natural for centrists...


[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yeah a Liberal who hasn't shown his face in this country for ages. No one was surprised there.


[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Youmaton#1190
May I ask, Bellman, you accuse the CA of no dedication, yet the PFC didnt run anyone for the senate


[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Youmaton#1190
why is this?


[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
No one from Liberal is complaining about this either. They seem to have accepted things.


[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Then how was he even put in the seante ballot?


[15-Jul-18 11:14 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Sorry, may I answer Youma's question?


[15-Jul-18 11:14 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Yes, you may, even though he's not a host on this specific show.


[15-Jul-18 11:14 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think it's a fair question, and not only Youma but the citizens of AustraliaSim I think deserve an answer.


[15-Jul-18 11:14 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway.


[15-Jul-18 11:15 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
You'll note that I have been on leave for the week leading up to this election, only just now having returned from a deep spiritual journey which I'm happy to report saw much personal growth from my point.


[15-Jul-18 11:16 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway, whilst away I was unable to sustain contact with my party. We were only really able to organise a candidate for the Lyne by-election, and that's largely because we had prepared long beforehand for it.


[15-Jul-18 11:16 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Furthermore, as a new party, we are still building supporters and developing our potential candidates.


[15-Jul-18 11:17 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You've lasted longer than most parties, your not new anymore


[15-Jul-18 11:17 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
We had hoped to run our deputy leader, @Sleet for the Senate election, but for several reasons, we decided it best we wait a while lnger before testing the waters.


[15-Jul-18 11:17 AM] Youmaton#1190
Must be sad for all the supporters of an Edible senate


[15-Jul-18 11:18 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Indeed. He will be on the next ballot, that's a promise.


[15-Jul-18 11:18 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, let's move onto our next question. There is the very real prospect that the government could lose their majority on both fronts today. What do you say about that?


[15-Jul-18 11:18 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh boy... The government isn't losing control any time soon.


[15-Jul-18 11:18 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Given all polling and the latest issue, its likely.


[15-Jul-18 11:19 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And I'm sad


[15-Jul-18 11:19 AM] Youmaton#1190
Im not 100% confident of that to be honest. Voter turn-out was surprisingly low.


[15-Jul-18 11:19 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I really disagree.


[15-Jul-18 11:19 AM] Youmaton#1190
By my numbers, Chisholm will be a tie, sending it to the court of disputed returns


[15-Jul-18 11:20 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Are you suggesting that the people who didn't vote were all alts?


[15-Jul-18 11:20 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think that's a daft thing to say...


[15-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm saying there is a non-zero chance


[15-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Youmaton#1190
I mean there was a convicted alt within the voter list, so who knows.


[15-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
either that or they're lazy


[15-Jul-18 11:21 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
or didn't know because the AEC didn't advertise


[15-Jul-18 11:21 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think it's just that they aren't inspired.


[15-Jul-18 11:21 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
The people have lost faith in parliament, so they don't bother voting anymore.

Seriously though, I'm not too sure.


[15-Jul-18 11:25 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I know his history has been with the Labour party and its former identities...


[15-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I doubt he'd side with me and the CA, we've had our personal differences in the past; however I'm open to working with him


[15-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yea Labour is likely


[15-Jul-18 11:25 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Though, while I was away for the campaign on my pilgrimage, I understand he seems to have taken a right leaning shift.


[15-Jul-18 11:26 AM] Youmaton#1190
I'm hoping that he sides with us, though he does seem open to talking to all sides


[15-Jul-18 11:26 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, onto our next question. If the government holds onto their majority, what happens next?


[15-Jul-18 11:26 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I do know, though, that ChairmanMeeseeks is a man of liberty. And whilst historically our economics have been a barrier for us, I think that he and I can work together a lot on some social issues.


[15-Jul-18 11:26 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Business as usual.


[15-Jul-18 11:27 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
The budget is right around the corner.


[15-Jul-18 11:27 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
agreed. We carry on and get the budget out


[15-Jul-18 11:27 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I've seen the drafts, I'm glad to say it's more or less ready.


[15-Jul-18 11:27 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Pretty much


[15-Jul-18 11:28 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I was hoping we'd see it introduced, nay, passed, before the Senate was out, alas, a budget is a long process.


[15-Jul-18 11:28 AM] Youmaton#1190
If Labour doesn't manage to take the Senate, we will still fight for the people of Australia. I'm looking forward to the budget, and I can't wait to make my opposition leaders response speech.


[15-Jul-18 11:28 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Nevertheless, the fact we have one at all is a real positive sign.


[15-Jul-18 11:28 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Do you think that a Youmaton premiership could occur if the government loses a majority?


[15-Jul-18 11:28 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
No comment


[15-Jul-18 11:29 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
No.

This is a national election.


[15-Jul-18 11:29 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Youma is in Federal parliament.


[15-Jul-18 11:29 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Nothing to do with Premiership at all.

[15-Jul-18 11:29 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ah, makes sense.


[15-Jul-18 11:30 AM] Youmaton#1190
Haha, they do lose majority if they lose Chisholm, so who knows what's in store.


[15-Jul-18 11:30 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well if the government loses government, then yeah, it's extremely likely... There isn't really any other option.


[15-Jul-18 11:30 AM] BellmanTGM#3331

If we can form government, we will be pushing through legislation that will help the workers of Australia. We will most definitely be running a referendum on the republic, and be working towards bi-partisan electoral reform. But a lot of this is what we hope to do, the real question falls on the voters of Chisholm on who they want.

[08-Aug-18 06:39 PM] delad#7470
well this poll is going to be our first good look at what the next parliament could look like


[08-Aug-18 06:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
As I understand, this poll is unlikely to be conducted to the same rigorous standards as other polling companies, and given how our voting system works here it is difficult to see how this poll will be useful.

{Reactions}

[08-Aug-18 06:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
However, the poll contained questions on general sentiments of this government, and on specific policies, which may be of interest for the layman.


[08-Aug-18 06:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Not only that, but the shape of the political landscape more generally, who has the most sway not just in parliament, but in voter blocs.
If certain minor parties do well here, they'll be most attractive to the big two when they consider coalition partners or who to preference.


[08-Aug-18 06:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
That may certainly be true to some extent but given how transient the electorate populations are, the results ultimately come down to the randomness of the allocation of registered voters at an election.


[08-Aug-18 06:43 PM] delad#7470
true


[08-Aug-18 06:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
In any case, I was wondering if our host can simply release the results, so we can discuss it further.


[08-Aug-18 06:43 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if say PFC does better than CA, that gives more power to PFC because they become more in demand and more influential particularly where PFC voters are strong but where the liberals or labour want to run candidates.


[08-Aug-18 06:44 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, anyone else have any input?


[08-Aug-18 06:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
even if distributed across electorates, one person often decides the fate of many an electorate


[08-Aug-18 06:45 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if that person is a minor party member, that makes a world of difference to said minor parties ability to promote its agenda to the larger parties within a broader coalition


[08-Aug-18 06:45 PM] General_Rommel#0190
The polling was voluntary and is unlikely to inform us significantly of voter trends.


[08-Aug-18 06:46 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Great interest should instead be attached to the non-numerical results that were received in the poll.


[08-Aug-18 06:46 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I am certainly curious as to what results we will be shown


[08-Aug-18 06:46 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
still, remarkably high turnout for a "voluntary poll"


[08-Aug-18 06:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

As I understand, this poll is unlikely to be conducted to the same rigorous standards as other polling companies, and given how our voting system works here it is difficult to see how this poll will be useful.

I believe the results bear this view out.

Does it show any trends? We did have a large turnout

[08-Aug-18 06:52 PM] General_Rommel#0190
The fact that it was voluntary has meant that the data in which this poll relied on was based on a flawed pool of people.


[08-Aug-18 06:52 PM] General_Rommel#0190
That is not to say the people were bad


[08-Aug-18 06:53 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I merely mean that the poll is unlikely to be representative of the population of our voters.


[08-Aug-18 06:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I think the low result for the Liberals is worrying.


[08-Aug-18 06:53 PM] Youmaton#1190
Alrightly, the TPP from this poll looks to be in.

Leader of the Opposition tbyrn21, anyone?


[08-Aug-18 06:54 PM] Youmaton#1190
Before we discuss, just announcing the TPP


[08-Aug-18 06:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Whilst not exactly the most empirical way of proving it, if one examines the amount of people who decided to take the voluntary poll and also post on the relevant thread, the amount of Liberals that decided to vote is very low.


[08-Aug-18 06:54 PM] Youmaton#1190
The independent vote seemed to split almost evenly, so we are looking at 

Labour 58.5 v 41.5 CA


[08-Aug-18 06:55 PM] delad#7470
what is noticable even with what Rommel's said is how low the vote for PFC is


[08-Aug-18 06:55 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I‚Äôd certainly be interested in seeing Labour v Liberal or Labour v Greens.


[08-Aug-18 06:55 PM] delad#7470
with that low vote combined with lack of members normally doing anything aside from bellman


[08-Aug-18 06:56 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It does seem however that the parties in government are rarely appreciated, especially in our small world.


[08-Aug-18 06:57 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I think the Centre Alliance is in a good spot.


[08-Aug-18 06:57 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It is quite rare for political parties to have lasted longer than a single term.


[08-Aug-18 06:58 PM] delad#7470
the centre has remained since the sims very first parliament


[08-Aug-18 06:58 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I should have explained myself better. What I mean is that political parties do not seem to last in government longer than a single term.


[08-Aug-18 06:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Remember when the Australian Democrats were the senior party of government? AnswerMeNow1 remembers.


[08-Aug-18 06:59 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Although admittedly, my role in *removing* the Australian Democratic government cannot be underestimated..


[08-Aug-18 06:59 PM] delad#7470

[08-Aug-18 07:02 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I think this data does validate the view which I expressed earlier that parties that are in government are generally less well perceived to their opposition counterparts.


[08-Aug-18 07:03 PM] General_Rommel#0190
But the averages may shed some more light?


[08-Aug-18 07:03 PM] Youmaton#1190

CA - 4.59
Liberal - 3.59
Labour - 6.18

[08-Aug-18 07:04 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Anyhow, beyond that, what is also reflected here is the apathy for political parties.


[08-Aug-18 07:04 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It is up to the political leaders, not the High Court, to give direction and meaning to our country, something which is in desperately short supply.

[08-Aug-18 07:10 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
despite the justices own misgivings toward labour, and I have mine as well, its just obvious the people are in favour of a Youmaton gov


[08-Aug-18 07:11 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It is not a misgiving, I think that is a mischaracterisation.


[08-Aug-18 07:11 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It's simply that people dislike the current mob and want to replace it with another mob.


[08-Aug-18 07:11 PM] General_Rommel#0190
That does not translate to a real endorsement of the Opposition leader.


[08-Aug-18 07:11 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
what, that of the people polled (which was a good portion of the electorate) people prefer youma?


[08-Aug-18 07:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
arguably, an endorsement of the opposition leader doesnt have to be "we love youma"
Its just "youma = best candidate"


[08-Aug-18 07:12 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Considering, as noted above, that this vote is not representative of the voting public, then the statistics here will ultimately be questionable.


[08-Aug-18 07:12 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I think, folks, that what the Justice is arguing is that a vote for the opposition leader is merely a vote for the lesser of 5 evils.


[08-Aug-18 07:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yes, thats obvious


[08-Aug-18 07:12 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I have neither denied or endorsed the Labour Leader.


[08-Aug-18 07:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
what im saying is lesser of five evils is still an endorsement


[08-Aug-18 07:13 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I am simply stating the opinion that this vote is, I believe, a reflection of the current government, or lack thereof.

but damn


[08-Aug-18 07:19 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I should merely point out that the polling was quite unrepresentative and these results are definitely questionable.


[08-Aug-18 07:19 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
How?


[08-Aug-18 07:20 PM] General_Rommel#0190
However, the trend is accurate.


[08-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Youmaton#1190

Agreed.


[08-Aug-18 07:23 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you dont really have much to fail on besides challenging the government
The government actually has to pass its agenda, realistically, while it is important, you only really exist to critique


[08-Aug-18 07:24 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
of course you'll be given good ratings, whats there to do wrong?

We have reports coming in from the High Court tonight stating that the Speaker of the House of Representatives has referred the MP's for Pearce, Lingiari and Wright to potentially be expelled over inactivity. Chances seem slim of any of those MP's remaining, under the strict guidelines of Re: MattMonti. We will keep you updated as we get more information.

First Question to the panel: why should the electors in Lingiari vote for you?


[19-Aug-18 02:49 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I know I haven‚Äôt been a perfect MP, but under my tenure, Lingiari has seen prosperity and I‚Äôve fought hard for treaty, Aboriginal rights and rural issues in parliament. If you re-elect me, I won‚Äôt let you down- I promise.


[19-Aug-18 02:51 PM] stalintwo#5787
Thanks for the question. Regional communities, especially in NT, are the most vulnerable, especially in our society today.  In fact, regional Australia contributes to one third of all of Australia's population and is critical to the nation's prosperity. If you elect me for Lingiari, I will make sure that regional Australia is a priority and that we're investing more money into these communities that often face certain issues (such as unemployment both youth and senior, lack of jobs, as well as higher petty crime rates)


[19-Aug-18 02:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For reference, I will ask both panel questions and individual questions as we progress, and as I see fit.

@stalintwo , will you be pushing for any advances in Aboriginal rights?


[19-Aug-18 02:55 PM] stalintwo#5787
We need to maintain that there is no place for race in the constitution is my belief regarding this.


[19-Aug-18 02:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
@AnswerMeNow2 response?


[19-Aug-18 02:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
stalinomics completely dodged the question there. If you re-elect me, I will push for actual advancements in Aboriginal rights, including ensuring representation of our first nation peoples in parliament, finally signing a treaty with Aboriginals, and establishing a tribunal similar to New Zealand‚Äôs Waitangi Tribunal to correct historical wrongs. Just because there are less Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders than MƒÅori, doesn‚Äôt make the actions of the past any less abhorrent.

next question, How will you support the farmers of the NT?

{Reactions}
üèî (2) 

[19-Aug-18 03:04 PM] stalintwo#5787
This is a huge priority for us. The National Party is very thankful to have support from thousands of farmers across Australia including NT. We're the coalition that introduced the Carpentaria Futures Fund, which will provide facilities to advance rural australia whilst maintaining a sense of security during drought time, as well as committing  to repeal petrol excise. We will also as well be funding (if elected) fixing of roads in the NT especially, so farmers can get to destinations safely and efficiently.


[19-Aug-18 03:04 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I will aim to expand farmer subsidies, as well as invest more in irrigation and farming in general as a part of Australia‚Äôs next government.

Of course I would. I was simply touching on some of my policies for farming.


[19-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
fair call.


[19-Aug-18 03:06 PM] stalintwo#5787
May I remind the green candidate that we don't have farmers subsidies?


[19-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm fairly sure we do, although it might be provided by the states


[19-Aug-18 03:06 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I‚Äôm pretty sure we do.


[19-Aug-18 03:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
can we get a fact check on it?


[19-Aug-18 03:07 PM] stalintwo#5787
This is federal parliament, not state.


[19-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moving on to health. How would you deal with rural health and providing services outside of those in the Major centres of the NT?


[19-Aug-18 03:08 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Health is an issue I care very deeply about, as many of you know, my wife was diagnosed with cancer recently. Under a Green government, I would expand health funding and funding to the Royal Flying Doctors Service, as well as create a dedicated Rural Health Service to address rural health issues.


[19-Aug-18 03:09 PM] stalintwo#5787
Rural health is a growing issue for many rural Australians, which is very applicable to the NT. The Nationals will make sure that we are investing more in regional healthcare, as well as fighting for expansion of rural health services, and most specifically birthing and dialysis unit funding


[19-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
@stalintwo would that also include services for other areas such as Central and Western Queensland?

That statistic is fantastic. In order to help employment rates, the Greens are committed to making higher education cheaper for students and incentivise young people to attend university.


[19-Aug-18 03:16 PM] stalintwo#5787
That's a great question. The Nationals will put forward multiple packages, if elected. These packages include a $350 million dollar regional jobs and investment fund to help economic growth in rural communities or isolated areas outside major settlements, individual regions will have access to up to $35 million in funding, as well as we will be working with the coalition to launch a new $600 million dollar 'employment for youth' package that focuses on upskilling youth and provide better educational opportunities to get them out of unemployment. These packages in return should boost our employment rates to an above average rate overall, and one to compete with nation wide.


[19-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
@AnswerMeNow2 would you support getting extra higher education services in rural areas?

In regards to climate change, what do you all think should be done?

We need to cut emissions and introduce a trade in program for fuel cars to be replaced with electric cars.


[21-Aug-18 05:44 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We should invest in tidal power and electric cars.


[21-Aug-18 05:45 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
@GenericCereal Perhaps we invest into safer and more efficient nuclear reactors first?

[21-Aug-18 05:46 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The Government happens to have a lot of money, and it's rather easy to use that to directly build batteries and renewable generation, rather than offering incentives and subsidies. I'd like to see low income housing receive batteries and solar panels paid for by the government, to directly bring costs down for vulnerable Australians.

Our public planning needs to strive for a world without cars as much as is viable. Obviously they hold a place, but people have become so reliant on their cars for trips that really don't require them.

Studies have proven that over time, as we enter Warming phases temperature increases lead to a growth in carbon emissions in our atmosphere


[21-Aug-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is due to the basic facts regarding vegetation with warmer humidities leading to the growth of more vegetation and as the plants die, their stored C02 is released into the atmosphere

I respect AMN, I think he's a good guy, though our policies are on very different ends of the spectrum I still think he's a great opponent to go up against

Ooops my bad x2, I'm somebody who fights for those who are underrepresented, somebody who wants change to the current system where rural and regional communities are underfunded, under appreciated and most importantly under valued. If Lingiari elects me I will ensure as party leader that their voice will be heard, ALL of their voice, not just a fraction, as well as more funding towards rural services.

BREAKING: We have news that a Court of DIsputed Returns case is being run against the nominations of Senators DKR and CM for their respective seats. It is unknown what will be argued, however we do know that it was put forward by former justice General_Rommel. If this case is successful, ramifications will take place, and will most likely lead to the referral and ejection of Treasurer TheAudibleAsh as well. Huge day in the courts, we will keep you all up to date as it happens.

Hello Everyone.


[25-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Youmaton#1190
So Alex. You recently declared you wished to form a new party, could you tell us about it?


[25-Aug-18 02:03 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
Well, I've noticed the Nationals are the only party focused on Agrarianism. And they are listed as right wing. So I thought a centre-centre left party focused on Agrarianism is needed. Agrarian Party would fill this. I have logos and policies in mind. I just need people to help create it. Manpower.


[25-Aug-18 02:04 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
It will focus on Mutualism, Agrarianism of course and Republicanism.


[25-Aug-18 02:04 PM] Youmaton#1190
Why should people consider it over other parties?


[25-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
Well as I said, there is only one party focused on Agrarianism and it is right wing. A centre left party looking out for our rural communities is something I think Australia needs. Helping out native communities while giving aid to our farmers and small towns.


[25-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
Social Democracy isn't commonly put in place in rural communities, but I believe it can help our farmers better than any party has before.


[25-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Youmaton#1190

Very Liberal. Queer people in rural communities are underrepresented. They have a harder time than most. It is the same for both the natives and immigrants to this country. Both are severely underrepresented in rural modern day Australia.

Lyne is another seat to watch this election. Some promient voters reside in this electorate, however the voter turnout will decide this. We can immediately discard Winston, who looks set to get 0 votes. Voter turnout will be key to this election, and the simulated vote will help conclude the result of this seat.

An unusual seat this election, a decent mix of voters for a typical Labour/Liberal showdown. The key decider will be voter turnout, as Ash will struggle to keep up with the modifiers generated by the Labour party. This seat will be close, but on the basis that the voter turnout is high we can make a call. Do keep in mind the pervious fact however.

There is a solid pro-greens base within Lingiari, however same can be said for the UDP forces. UDP will certainly get more modifiers, however voter inactivity could be their downfall. At this current time, we have a call. Keep in mind this could change based on voter turnout.

A marginal seat this election, with both camps having some very active candidates. The AusCon's will be lucky to get a single vote, leaving it to a competition between Saiyan and Liesel. Both candidates have been hard at work this election, and will receive near identical personal modifiers. This election will come down to voter turnout, and maybe even former Justice Rommel.

Another traditional Labour v Liberal seat, this time with a much closer margin. Supernatural has been seen nowhere on the campaign field, whilst WillShakespeare has been active in his push.

[13-Sep-18 11:58 PM] Youmaton#1190
Contested by phyllicanderer (Greens) and NKG (Reason).

The most high profile battle of the election, all eyes will be on this seat. Both NKG and phylli have been out on the campaign field, though NKG was out earlier. A handful of Labour voters can be noted here, alongside some liberals. Voter turnout will decide this seat. This is the only seat where we will give the following verdict:

Contested by PM-ME-SPRINKLES (Labour) and Dicky_Knee. 

Another high profile rae, however one that can be resolved more cleanly. Dicky was unexpectedly dumped from the Liberal senate list in favour of Prime Minister PineappleCrusher, and is up against the current shadow attorney general. There is some support for Dicky, but due to the fall of the Liberals and the strong personal modifier of Sprinkles, this seat can be resolved.

:Labour: will take the seat.

A close seat, with Republic advocate Lurker running against CA's silicon. Silicon's lack of appearance on the electoral field may be their downfall. It is a close seat, but with modifiers favouring Labour, a call can be made.

An interesting seat, with the Liberals placing a high profile candidate in this seat, just as how Labour put one in Whitlam. However in this case, preferences seem to be not in favour of the major party. With the liberal collapse, and a higher personal modifier from stranger, a call can be made.

The impact of this result will show Labour as the largest party in a clear margin, with the Liberal party confirming their collapse. Reason and UDP will profit from the chaos, both picking up 3 seats each. Whilst tbyrn will fail in Whitlam, stalinomics will save the party in Canberra allowing them to retain their position in parliament.

There we have it folks. After 3 days of negotiations, after many sleepless nights for the Governor-General, we have a government. UDP have struck a deal with Reason, Centre Alliance, and the liberals to form a government that the opposition has labelled "The Coalition of Chaos". We have recently seen the newest Prime Minister, BloodyChrome, swear in as Prime Minister alongside Liberal Leader TheAudibleAsh as Deputy Prime Minister. This is obviously a big blow to the opposition, who were forecast to win this election by nearly every poll. With parliament opening tomorrow, we will get to see the outline of this new government, a new coalition that will decide the future of Australia. Will it the BC/Ash team create a stable and memorable government, or will it fall into ruin like its predecessor? Only time will tell.

I want to deliver stable and forthright representation for the people of Kingston, and honestly at this stage that is the most important thing.

[18-Sep-18 08:46 PM] Youmaton#1190
We saw a long and brutal campaign, with the only independent who was thought to stand a chance fall no where near the votes needed to reach the senate. What do you think distinguishes you from previous independent candidates, what do you offer as an unique alternative to the current political parties.


[18-Sep-18 08:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I think at the end of the say all Independent candidates have one thing on their mind - that it's time to focus on the local. And that is what I am aiming for. Of course, there have been a few other independent Members or Senators, but I want to point to my track record in Banks/Greenway - nearly 5 terms of representation, getting legislation through the Parliament, amending and debating on Bills - unlike other members - to actually make them better. And of course, I have served in the community after my stint in Parliament as a Judiciary member. But coming back to the premise - that of distinguishing between the political parties. The political parties today simply cannot seem to hold themselves together well. There is no point, I say to the people of Kingston, to put a party apparatchik that is there, elected as a member of the Party, who then causes disunity or then resigns or then defects. Unlike the other parties, people know me and can trust their vote in me.


[18-Sep-18 08:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
If you could pass one piece of legislation, what would you pass and why?


[18-Sep-18 08:55 PM] General_Rommel#0190
As a lowly independent, I generally do not have the stay to write Bills. But assuming that some magic wizard wrote a Bill according to the specifications set out, I would want to see passed in this term of Parliament a Bill to finally introduce an infrastructure fund. It's like how the RBA independently manages monetary policy - why not let Infrastructure Australia do that? We should arm them with 75bn and set them to building a better Australia. Bills that are generally social, not economic, can only go so far in changing the very fabric of this nation - and that is why I would like to see such a Bill, assuming a person out there is capable of writing it!


[18-Sep-18 08:59 PM] Youmaton#1190
Do you support a royal commission into aged care, and separately a royal commission into banking and financial services? (M: to bring those events happening irl into canon)


[18-Sep-18 09:00 PM] General_Rommel#0190
The premise sounds intriguing and I would likely support it, but I cannot say with certainty whether I will support such a Royal Commission till the wording is shown. A Royal Commission, after all, does not solve the problem. And with many of the problems already identified, I believe the best course of action is simply to deliver the solutions that Australians expect.


[18-Sep-18 09:01 PM] Youmaton#1190
What are your thoughts on the situation regarding the constitutional convention into the republic? Were you disappointed that little was done on it in the last parliament, and what words would you have to the new government in relation to this?


[18-Sep-18 09:02 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Well look, I am on the record on supporting the McGarvie Model. In fact, I was a delegate in the Constitutional Convention on this subject. I expect that the McGarvie Model be implemented, if this Government puts a priority onto it. I will not be too fussed if they do not make it a priority, but if they do make it so, I expect them to deliver on it.


[18-Sep-18 09:03 PM] Youmaton#1190
What are your hopes for this parliament in general, regardless of if you get elected or not?


[18-Sep-18 09:05 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Look at the end of the day, what I want is to see Bills. The people elect us so we can debate and hopefully pass Bills. The previous Parliament was a bit on the short side for that. I hope that this Parliament can do a much better job.


[18-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Youmaton#1190
If elected, would you put yourself forward as Speaker of the House?


[18-Sep-18 09:10 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Yes, but that would only be if there is no Speaker of the House yet. With the Prime Minister likely to open Parliament before the conclusion of this by-election, I would imagine that whoever becomes the new representative will find that there is already a Speaker.


[18-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Youmaton#1190
Your nomination for this byelection was out of the blue, a surprise for nearly everyone. What was the final thing that convinced you that you had to run for parliament.


[18-Sep-18 09:13 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Look when in a day where people should be celebrating their victory at being able to represent their constituents and build a better Australia, all we had was division disunity and defections. The MP-Elect for Kingston left. A Labour Senator resigned and another decided to form his own party. And a Liberal senator resigned. It just seems that the major parties don't get it. And there is one loser from this - the electorate and their people. And it's high time they deserved better.


[18-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Youmaton#1190
What message do you want to send to all parties?


[18-Sep-18 09:16 PM] General_Rommel#0190
That's a pretty open-ended question but look I want all parties to get their bloody act together, and do the favour of proposing Bills. Bills should not be hidden away unless you become the Government or some silly argument like that. The people expect debate around issues important to them, not point scoring and jibber jabber. I really do hope that any party that is in Parliament will seriously attempt to legislate - for the better of Australia.

Is there anything else you would like to say to the country, the politicians, and more importantly, your electorate of Kingston?

Put an independent voice in Parliament - they often turn out much better than the party candidates!

**BREAKING NEWS** - Australia tonight can report from information from an anonymous source that Government MP's are being forced to vote aye to all proposed amendments to the Intersex Protection Bill that is currently in front of the House of Reps. In particular, the amendments proposed by the Deputy Prime Minister remove the provisions that enforce the bill, thus rendering the bill pointless.

In electoral law, it states that "A person shall not ask for, receive or obtain, or offer or agree to ask for, or receive or obtain, any property or benefit of any kind, whether for the same or any other person, on an understanding that:
1. any vote of the first-mentioned person;
2. any candidature of the first-mentioned person;
3. any support of, or opposition to, a candidate, group of candidates or a political party by the first-mentioned person;
4. the doing of any act or thing by the first-mentioned person the purpose of which is, or the effect of which is likely to be, to 
5. influence the preferences set out in the vote of an elector; or
6. the order in which the names of candidates nominated for election to the Senate whose names are included in a group in accordance with section 168 appear on a ballot paper;
will, in any manner, be influenced or affected."


[30-Sep-18 09:31 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Essentially, what it means, is you can't give away or sell things for votes.


[30-Sep-18 09:32 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We believe that giving away this free food could be reasonably interpreted as attempting to influence voters by them recieving this.


[30-Sep-18 09:32 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
However, there is ambiguity.


[30-Sep-18 09:32 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Australia Tonight will be recommending the @Electoral Commission launch an investigation into this.


[30-Sep-18 09:34 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Welcome to Australia Tonight, and tonight we have the results of our Australian Republic survey!


[15-Oct-18 10:33 PM] Youmaton#1190
Today we set another record for Australia tonight, with 31 respondents to the poll!


[15-Oct-18 10:33 PM] Youmaton#1190
First of all, lets start with the best. We asked the question "Do you support an Australian Republic". Here is the result;

[15-Oct-18 10:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
As you can see, we have a slim but convincing majority for the yes camp on this issue. It remains a controversial topic, though public opinion has certainly moved towards favouring it more in recent times.


[15-Oct-18 10:35 PM] Youmaton#1190
Next we asked what model one would like to be used in the event of a republic. It seems some respondants didnt understand the question, though it makes for some interesting data

We can see that McGarvie still holds a considerable amount of popularity, however the camp that would prefer a directly elected head  of state has grown considerably since the 1999 referendum.


[15-Oct-18 10:39 PM] Youmaton#1190
These results are certainly something to take in, with the prospect of a looming 2nd referendum on the republican issue coming into the public sphere, one must wonder if this will affect public policy. We can only wait and see.

Pineapple Crusher is an absolute buffoon. A total fool. He's come out and said this was all "a meme." The sheer arrogance of a sitting Senator to suggest that Israel should annex the Levant because suggesting it in the halls of power gives him a good chuckle is nothing short of disgraceful. If PC cannot be bothered to have even a shred of respect for one of the most brutal and sensetive conflicts of the past hundred years, then he does not belong in parliament. If he cannot be bothered to treat parliament with all the seriousness it deserves, then we'd be best off chucking him onto the streets of Canberra on his arse. It brings great shame to our nation that he was ever Prime Minister.

To answer the question, the actions lately by Senator PC have been outrageous but not surprising. He does not take the job seriously, and treats international peace as a joke. He does not care for the unstable situation in the middle east, as he wishes to make a joke to make up for his dire situation within his own party. We must stand up to him, Ash must stand up to him, the parliament must condemn him.

I am yet to be swayed why we have to change, or what to

With dictatorship everything gets done a lot faster


[28-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
And it saves a lot of time and money


[28-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I prefer a sensible constitutional monarchy


[28-Oct-18 07:49 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Would you say a dictatorship.... of the proletariat?


[28-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
But in all seriousness a Republic is good


[28-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
where the monarch has tons of power they dont use

In all seriousness you resigning is good


[28-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Youmaton#1190
Why should someone unelected have that power


[28-Oct-18 07:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
because their parent gave it to them

Exactly Youma! That's why we should elect them.

Why should someone who is an uneducated idiot have that power

[28-Oct-18 08:08 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yeah i guess


[28-Oct-18 08:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Anyway, I am not a fan of a littering fine. While littering is terrible, and if you do it you're a prick, individual action cannot save the environment. Corporations routinely get away with massive environmental damage, and until they are punished routinely and harshly, it seems hypocritical to punish old mate dropping his chip packet.

Oh absolutely. We need to make sure politicians are held to account. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't happened yet.

and finally what are your thoughts on #showstealer4mp?


[28-Oct-18 08:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Listen, I'm going to be entirely honest here. Initially, I was not on board. I find showstealer to be needlessly abrasive, he's got daft opinions on Greyhound racing, and his opinions obviously don't line up with mine. But after seeing the farce parliament has become, I'll take what I can get, and showstealer is probably one of the best options right now.

Wonder where he got that one


[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

Could this be a sign the government's communications coordinator is starting to slip? They've previously done an excellent job at preventing their MPs from going on the tirades and meltdowns that are common in the Australian political scene, yet it seems now DirtySaiyan is engaging in a patented Matt Monti Meltdown‚Ñ¢


[30-Oct-18 04:16 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
However, as Matt is a Socialist it is my understand that trademark is *not* actively enforced.

[09-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Youmaton#1190
Tonight we are here with an exclusive story, one that could possibly cause quite the upset within the political sphere. Today we will look into bureaucracy, the constitution, and the surprising failures of governments across the board.


[09-Feb-19 09:16 PM] Youmaton#1190
This crisis relates to a recent government, one rushed to fulfill a promise it made, one whom did fulfill promises but only at the last second.


[09-Feb-19 09:16 PM] Youmaton#1190
Let's first look at the constitution, the pinnacle document of this nation, the defining piece of legislation that deems what may be done by the parliament.


[09-Feb-19 09:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
For those at home, feel free to get your handy pocket constitution ready, or load it up on your browser (https://drive.google.com/viewer?url=https://gitlab.com/AustraliaSim/public/raw/master/legislation.australias.im/docs/constitution.pdf&x=#buttonblue)

"A vote, resolution, or proposed law, for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor-General to the House in which the proposal originated"


[09-Feb-19 09:22 PM] Youmaton#1190
A section clear cut as to the rules of appropriations, followed by nearly all previous governments.


[09-Feb-19 09:24 PM] Youmaton#1190
In recent times, under the names of both recent former Governor-Generals, most governments have properly fulfilled this requirement to properly allow their budgetary measures to be assented into law, however unfortunately AustraliaTonight can reveal an unfortunate fact.


[09-Feb-19 09:24 PM] Youmaton#1190

The BloodyChrome budget was introduced in early December, to some controversy but general consensus that it would pass the parliament due to the government at the times super majority within the House of Representatives.


[09-Feb-19 09:28 PM] Youmaton#1190

We now have comments from Liberal Deputy Dicky_Knee on the situation.


[05-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Youmaton#1190
In a statement to Australia Tonight, Dicky Knee stated that "There is clearly an ugly element of insurrection and destruction within the parties. Those have been weeded out after they were exposed". In response to Leader Porridges message that he will take action against him, Dicky replied, "I will not bend to threats".


[05-Mar-19 06:47 PM] Youmaton#1190
He also specified that "There is only one official liberal headquarters, and thats the original one that has been already used.
Not the fake one *[sic]*"

[05-Mar-19 06:53 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Because of people like Richard Knee, the Liberals have been stripped back of membership and resources. We had no choice if we were going to have a chance in the upcoming election. I decided that we had to accumulate these things to prevent something that must not happen: a re-elected Youmaton Government.

"There is an element within the party who were placed as a cell for the BUP. They attempted to vote for a merger with the BUP, essentially destroying the Liberal brand and party. When this vote failed, the colluders started a fake headquarters and have lied to encourage the party faithful to leave the party. Clearly they are set out only to destroy, and frankly I won't tolerate this."

@PineappleCrusher_ your thoughts?


[05-Mar-19 06:59 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
The vote succeeded. Richard, once again, has been proven to be a liar and is smearing his opponents to advance his agenda. The leader of the Liberals is Porridge and Richard Knee has no power for his actions: its a clear violation of internal workings.


[05-Mar-19 07:00 PM] Youmaton#1190
Thank you for coming on the show, any last things you wish to say?


[05-Mar-19 07:02 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Richard Knee cannot put forward a motion to become leader of the Liberals. All motions in the Liberal Federal Executive must be put to a vote by the President of the Executive. That is me. I can only be removed as President by the leader of the Liberals, which is Porridge.

"I think it's disappointing and something that no party and especially leader should have to go through. Having your deputy undemocratically overthrow you is appalling. If this is how senior members are going to act, I think they should re-evaluate what they stand for. This is undemocratic and highly unprofessional. I‚Äôd also like to extend a welcoming hand to any liberal member who'd like a new place to call home."

[17-Mar-19 09:42 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
The Liberals had a lead throughout the election, but it tightened as polls closing came closer @Youmaton


[17-Mar-19 09:45 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Newspoll's data suggests that second preferences might not come into play, however the Margin of Error stresses that Parramatta is still not a solid win for the Liberals.


[17-Mar-19 09:46 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Moving onto Moncrieff, The Australian can confirm that Liberal leader @GenericCereal will hold on to his blue-ribbon seat of Moncrieff despite concerns of a depressed Liberal base turnout.


[17-Mar-19 09:48 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Porridge is predicted to win Moncrieff with a similar margin to PineappleCrusher_ in Parramatta. Tonight is not a good night for the Liberals in Australia's most Conservative cities - the Gold Coast and Toowoomba. Both are in Moncrieff and have flirted with electing Hoogstra.


[17-Mar-19 09:48 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
The Australian, however, is more confident in Porridge's win in Moncrieff than PineappleCrusher_'s win in Parramatta.


[17-Mar-19 09:48 AM] Youmaton#1190
What are the likelihoods would you say of Liberal victories in these seats?


[17-Mar-19 09:49 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
58% in Parramatta and 90% in Moncrieff


[17-Mar-19 09:50 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
The Australian can also predict that Perth is ***too close to call*** but with Viado_Celtru in the lead.

[17-Mar-19 09:51 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Perth will come down to preferences, but exclusive polling in the electorate suggests that the Social Democrat will struggle to overcome the votes flowing to the Liberals and the Australian Conservatives.


[17-Mar-19 09:52 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
If Viado_Celtru does not win, The Australian believes that Winston Wilhelmus of the Australian Conservatives will become the Member for Perth.

At this rate, the Social Democrats will be the largest party in the House, and will play a key roll in deciding who will join them in coalition. However, if the SocDems end up winning all 3 of the seats they are contesting in question, they will fall just short of a majority on 9 seats.

*AustraliaTonight,

What are your thoughts on how close the seat of Perth is, and do you believe you can pull off a victory?*


[17-Mar-19 11:16 AM] Youmaton#1190
**I am totally confident there will be a Conservative victory in Perth. There is no place more Australian than in Perth, and the people of Perth know exactly what's right for Australia. They know to put Australia First, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. The Liberals have lost their way and their leadership has no sense of direction, which is exactly why I left, because they're more interested in starting internal issues in their own party than actually figuring out where they are and what they're doing, whereas the Social Democrats aren't even worth mention. The Conservatives will win Perth, and as a result, Perth will win.**


[17-Mar-19 11:16 AM] Youmaton#1190
*What are your thoughts on the prospect of a re-elected Social Democratic Party government?*


[17-Mar-19 11:17 AM] Youmaton#1190
**I am doubtful that the Social Democrats would form any kind of stable government, however in the circumstances that they do I will oppose, oppose, and oppose those bastards. They have no business in Australia and no business representing Australia. Australia must be led by Australians true of heart, and the Social Democrats aren't Australian nor do they have hearts.**

*AustraliaTonight,

What are your thoughts as deputy Liberal leader on your party's performance at the election, with your party only winning 1 lower house seat?*

**I think the voters have expressed their frustrations with leadership instability and its just backlash from porridges incompetence. My seat was won by a strong margin so the rest of the party clearly has a lot to answer for.**

*You call your party leader "incompetent", does this mean you will be moving a leadership spill against him?*

**No, not until I can verify the security of our party elections, otherwise it would be futile. The last leadership ballot which was properly and validly held by an independent polling outsource (thanks Aus Tonight) showed a significant swing towards me as leader (8-2 I belive) but this result was discarded by the hired goons (PC) abd he held his own "secure" ballot which suddenly had an enourmous swing towards porridge within the space of 24 hours. So in answer to your question, not until the party ballots can be trusted.**

*What are your thoughts on the voters of parramatta rejecting PC, someone your party was hoping would make it into the next parliament?*

**I think they've spoken loud and clear that the so-called "moderates" who are determined to split the party down the middle are not to be in our parliament. PC is a whore. He has begged the Liberals countless times for support and when he didn't get what he wanted he rampaged and tried to annihilate it all. PC will be overcome. I am glad the prople of parramatta rejected him, but I also admit the spread of candidates wasnt that great. I hope Horror can do a good job**


[19-Mar-19 06:59 PM] Youmaton#1190
*Finally, what are your thoughts on the new SDP-UDP government?*

**I think it's terrible and that no government should deal with the likes of that awful eehee. We do not negotiate with terrorists and trolls. Eehee should drop dead.**

*Thats a bit rude isnt it?*

**I think in this instance it's justified. Also can I just remind the voters to contact me if they wish to have any issues that matter to them raised in the senate. I am hoping my vote can be strategic for getting things done in the house of review.**

*Thank you for your time Mr Knee*

**Thank you Youmaton and the good folks at Australia Tonight.**

Liberal Leader Porridge has released a statement regarding the recent words of Dicky_Knee on this network:

**There is no frustration from the voters regarding leadership instability. We suffered a large swing against us because the majority of our right-wing caucus joined the Aussie Conservatives.

Despite out our obvious swing, we still managed to pick up one house seat and control 2 seats in the Senate, better than the Australian Conservatives did. 

Given the activity of Mr Knee prior to the election, I can safely say that if we were under his Leadership, there would be no Liberal presence in the House and we'd be clinging on in the Senate.
If Mr Knee does challenge the leadership of the Liberal Party and wins. I will immediately resign from the party, and thus the Liberals will not have a presence in the House.
The issue we faced this election was not voter frustration, but a voter split from the cleansing of fascism from the party, with Aussie Conservative leaving to form his own party.**

"Neither senators wanted to merge"

"Senator A doesnt want to talk to, or work with Senator B, while Senator B didnt want to get involved with the alt-right"

On Thursday we had a much higher chance of forming a progressive Socialist-Greens government, until the SDP decided to backstab the political ideology that purport to possess by getting two endorsements from the UDP for seats they won't win, and if they do somehow win will be taking off the Socialists, and in exchange they endorsed Lyin' Liesel in Mayo, one of the tighter seats.

Let me tell you right now that there's nothing wrong with a deficit. However if you're a Prime Minister like our current one for the next 24 hours, and you say over and over "oh no I want a surplus, I want a surplus" and think you've delivered one when you actually gave Australia a $42 billion deficit, then you're just irresponsible and not fit to govern the country


[04-May-19 05:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Of course we can't forget the UDP's candidate for Brisbane was the Treasurer, I believe, who delivered that disastrous budget, which is part of why we put him last.


[04-May-19 05:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Because he is fundamentally unfit for office if he doesn't understand how it works..


[04-May-19 05:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Our solution to the deficit is simple. Making the rich pay their fair share.

Welcome to Australia Tonight, with a wrap up of recent political events!


[07-May-19 09:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
After a day of negotiations, we now have a government. Socialist Leader @LuSing My Religion has signed a coalition government deal with Australian Greens Leader @imnofox to become Prime Minister of Australia, officially ending just over four months of Social Democratic rule.


[07-May-19 09:38 PM] Youmaton#1190
The Prime Minister was busy over the past 24 hours, with administrative orders, foreign affairs orders, cabinet reshuffling and Order of Australia appointments all on the agenda for the first day in office.


[07-May-19 09:40 PM] Youmaton#1190
The first DKR ministry was released earlier today, with returning faces such as former Chief Justice @Rat being returned to the position of Attorney-General, and former Prime Minister @Deleted User returning to the cabinet.


[07-May-19 09:41 PM] Youmaton#1190
The full list of the DKR ministry is avaliable on our website, or at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gD-wRYBuRCVfw2Jm69LMJ-RBt-YWAvhmaqU6oVNaHZE/edit#gid=0

[07-May-19 09:43 PM] Youmaton#1190
The Prime Minister was then soon after seen holding a press conference around 7 o'clock announcing the issuing of Administrative Orders, and the announcement of two appointments to the Order of Australia. Former Prime Ministers @PineappleCrusher_ and @Deleted User were both awarded with Companion of the Order of Australia honours for their service as Prime Minister, and for their advocacy for the nation. Australia Tonight wishes to congratulate both awardees on their appointments.


[07-May-19 09:47 PM] Youmaton#1190
The appointments were met with mostly positive response, with  many community members including now Former Prime Minister Youmaton congratulating both awardees on their appointment. Former Prime Minister BloodyChrome criticised the appointments on twitter, questioning why other former Prime Minister did not receive such honours.


[07-May-19 09:51 PM] Youmaton#1190
Senator Matt Monti and former Senator Lieselta announced today the formation of the "SA-BEST Alliance". The cross-party group defines itself as a "group of individuals dedicated to seeing South Australia's interests heard in Canberra and ensuring that South Australia is no longer forgotten by the eastern state". The group also states that one of its objectives is to keep Mayo MP and Minister for Education Fosfossil to account and to "not allow the Socialists to drag South Australia through the dirt".


[07-May-19 09:54 PM] Youmaton#1190
On to more breaking news, a twitter feud has broken out between parliamentarians after the announcement of the group "QLD-BEST" by Former house speaker hk-laichar. Under the terms "wobble wobble", the group announcement seemed to parody the "SA-BEST" announcement made by Lieselta and MattMonti. The opposition were quick to call out this announcement, accusing hk-laichar of "treating Queensland as a joke".

Finally, a larger feud has broken out between the government and opposition, after comments made by New South Wales Senator NGSpy. The following is a copy of starting conservation in twitter:

[07-May-19 10:00 PM] Youmaton#1190
Both LDP and UDP MPs have condemned these words, with many politicians calling for the Prime Minister to call for NGSpy to resign.

Welcome back. We have received a reply from PM-ME-SPRINKLES.


[24-May-19 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
She says:
"Because this is a 50+ year old man who wants to flirt with 17 year olds.". 

"I will not protect someone who thinks its okay to form a underage  relationship, especially when theyre 30-40+ years older than them
not even in a way that is a joke.
Paedophilia is not something anyone, EVER should joke about"


[24-May-19 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is specifically over an incident where Griffo "winked and chuckled" and made a joke about flirting with a 17 year old worker.

I find it completely appalling for a parliamentary representative to accuse me of being a pedophile without any basis whatsoever and I will be calling for her resignation.


[24-May-19 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
She stated that your joke where you flirted with a 17 year old girl is the basis.


[24-May-19 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do you see that joke as acceptable?


[24-May-19 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I did not flirt with a 17 year old girl


[24-May-19 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I commonly wink and chuckle, grandfathers wink and chuckle to their grandchildren, mates wink and chuckle with each other.

You did not know this person from a bar of soap, quite a different relationship from a grandparent and their grandchildren.


[24-May-19 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
When I spoke to her, I asked her if she comes to the Hungry Jacks often. The reason it was a joke was because I knew that she worked here and it was humorous because it was my first time in years going there.


[24-May-19 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Nothing of romantic basis

With regards to the wink and chuckle, it was a friendly gesture which I make to people out on the street when I meet with them.

This is just another slanderous attack against me with no concrete basis whatsoever, much like how the Greens have accused me of supporting child labour and wanting an ‚Äòonly coal‚Äô energy grid. They have misrepresented (and in the case of the child labour and coal quotes-made up) situations in order to drag me down for personal benefit and I call for the Speakers resignation over her disgusting behaviour.

Hello, and welcome to Australia Tonight.


[27-Sep-19 10:28 AM] Youmaton#1190
The hotly contested September 2019 election campaign is almost at a close, and tomorrow Australian's will get their say on who they want to govern their future. The incumbant United Democratic Party looks to position themselves as the 'sensible centre', whilst the Liberal/National Coalition lead by Opposition Leader porriidge seeks to take Australia in a different direction. We have also seen the rapid rise of the newly reformed Social Democratic Party, lead by former Prime Minister Youmaton, who has been promising greater worker protections and a change in the tax system.

Well, it's been very interesting. I've seen a lot of outrageous things and a lot of inspiring things, but I think overall, while the amount of uncontested seats has decreased, it's still disappointing.

[27-Sep-19 10:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
I suppose he does. But honestly, when I look at a national scale, there's one political party, in the absence of the South Gippsland Network, that has my support, and that's the Social Democratic Party.

The electorate of **Lingiari**, making up the entirety of the Northern Territory


[27-Sep-19 10:48 AM] Youmaton#1190
This election the seat will be contested by incumbent MP DexterAamo, and Former Prime Minister BloodyChrome.


[27-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Youmaton#1190
We've certainly seen the former Prime Minister out campaigning, though there seems to be a lack of input from the current MP.


[27-Sep-19 10:52 AM] Youmaton#1190
The leaked email from the SDP which surfaced last night also accuses DexterAamo of being ineligible to hold the seat, due to a failure to register to vote.

@Deleted User What are your thoughts on this?

Well, in terms of posters, I'm backing fartoomuchpressure.


[27-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Youmaton#1190
TheAudibleAsh received the endorsement of the National Party earlier today, which might give him the advantage as no other party has given their endorsement to FTMP so far.


[27-Sep-19 10:59 AM] Youmaton#1190
Now to the seat of **Moncrieff**, where we have a three-way contest. Former Prime Minister and incumbent MP PineappleCrusher of the Liberal Party is up against the United Democratic Party's Plupsnup and Independent candidate Imnofox.


[27-Sep-19 11:03 AM] Youmaton#1190
So far we have seen no campaigning from any of the candidates. @Deleted User how do you think this will turn out?


[27-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
I honestly am not sure. I'd predict PC will win out, if only for his history and incumbency.


[27-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Youmaton#1190
Certainly will be a seat to watch, with the Nationals endorsing the former Prime Minister, and the SDP surprisingly endorsing the independent candidate.


[27-Sep-19 11:06 AM] Youmaton#1190
Next up is the seat of **Cunningham**, with the SDP's HazardArrow up against the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party's BHjr132.


[27-Sep-19 11:07 AM] Youmaton#1190
So far we have seen more campaigning come out of the satirical party then the SDP itself, what are your thoughts on this @Deleted User


[27-Sep-19 11:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well, honestly, if it wasn't for the fact that their name was the Sun-Ripened Warm Tomato Party, I'd put this down to BHjr132.


[27-Sep-19 11:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
But I think an SDP gain is more likely.


[27-Sep-19 11:09 AM] Youmaton#1190
Now to the seat of **Sydney**, which has turned to be the most hotly contested seat this election. We have seen Nationals Leader Riley8583 go head to head with former Senator NGSpy.


[27-Sep-19 11:10 AM] Youmaton#1190
Polling released a few days ago showed Riley ahead with a 9% lead over the former leader of the Socialist Party, however with campaigning heating up towards the end it could turn out close.


[27-Sep-19 11:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
I hope that NGSpy wins, and I think he's in with a chance considering Riley's unnecessary defection, and he's been whipping out the Liberal name and brand half the time to try and win.


[27-Sep-19 11:11 AM] Youmaton#1190
What likelyhood do you have for each of the candidates?


[27-Sep-19 11:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Probably 60% for NGSpy, 40% for Riley8583.

Bold prediction, we shall see tomorrow if it pays off


[27-Sep-19 11:14 AM] Youmaton#1190
Next up we have the seat of **Hotham**, contested by incumbent Superpacman04 of the Nationals, and ODYG of the Social Democrats.


[27-Sep-19 11:14 AM] Youmaton#1190
Currently we have seen a reasonable re-election campaign from the National party, and very little from the SDP here so far


[27-Sep-19 11:15 AM] Youmaton#1190
@Deleted User Would it be safe to call this seat safe for the Nationals?


[27-Sep-19 11:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes.


[27-Sep-19 11:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
I also think that Sydney will probably turf out the Nats and vote for the 'wish washing' candidate, however.


[27-Sep-19 11:18 AM] Youmaton#1190
Finally, we have the electorate of **Denison** compromising of all of the state of Tasmania. This seat is being contested by long term incumbent MP and Prime Minister dyljam, and Independent candidate KernowRydh.


[27-Sep-19 11:19 AM] Youmaton#1190
Painting a similar picture to many other electorates, we have seen a reasonable re-election campaign from the incumbent, with little to no response from the opponent.


[27-Sep-19 11:23 AM] Youmaton#1190
It would be pretty safe to say that this seat will once again be won by Prime Minister dyljam.


[27-Sep-19 11:23 AM] Youmaton#1190
@Deleted User Any words before we do our recap?


[27-Sep-19 11:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Not really. I think dyljam will almost certainly zoom in.


[27-Sep-19 11:27 AM] Youmaton#1190
Alrighty its time for the recap.


[27-Sep-19 11:27 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Pearce** - A hotly contested seat with both sides heavily pushing to be the local representative. This seat is **too close to call**


[27-Sep-19 11:28 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Lingiari** - With the looming legal threats over the incumbent MP, and the strong campaign presence from the UDP, we can easily call this seat for the UDP :udp:


[27-Sep-19 11:29 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Capricornia** - A seat which unfortunately is suffering a lack of campaigning, however the endorsement from the National party should lead to a **Liberal** :liberal: victory.


[27-Sep-19 11:30 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Moncrieff** - A seat which has somehow avoided all sense of campaigning, even with a high profile candidate such as PineappleCrusher. Despite everything, it is likely that PineappleCrusher's local reputation will lead to a **Liberal** :liberal: retain.


[27-Sep-19 11:32 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Cunningham** - An unusual election for sure, with the satirical candidate coming forward with the most campaigning. The SDP may be able to just sneak a victory due to the party name, however currently it's **too close to call**


[27-Sep-19 11:34 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Sydney** - The prize for any government that wishes to form this election, Sydney looks to be the seat everyone will be paying very attention to. The Nationals seem to hold out a slight edge against the SDP at this time, so for now we will call it a **National** hold.

[27-Sep-19 11:35 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Robertson** - A seat in which we unfortunately skipped analysis for before. Contested by incumbent JaydenDaGamer15 and former Prime Minister Drunk_King_Robert. We have yet to see any campaigning from the former Prime Minister, and many events held by the incumbent MP regarding mental health. Due to this, we can call this a **SDP** :sdp: hold.


[27-Sep-19 11:36 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Hotham** - What was predicted to be a highly contested seat has turned into a scene of a National landslide. Little SDP campaigning here will lead to an easy **National** victory.


[27-Sep-19 11:38 AM] Youmaton#1190
**Denison** - The Prime Minister will seek to continue his long-serving job as MP for Denison, with Independent KernowRydh contesting the seat against him. With zero campaigning from the Independent, it is easy to call this seat for the **UDP**:udp:.


[27-Sep-19 11:38 AM] Youmaton#1190
Overall, here is our prediction including walkovers.


[27-Sep-19 11:39 AM] Youmaton#1190
**14th Parliament**

:liberal: - 4
:sdp: - 3
:udp: - 3
**NAT** - 2
üêº - 1
**TCTC** - 2


[27-Sep-19 11:41 AM] Youmaton#1190
The magic number to get is 8, so at this time the only coalitions that could form government are LIB-UDP-NAT, LIB-NAT-SDP and LIB-SDP-IND.

Well his endorsement of a party that isn‚Äôt even in a Federal Coalition, I mean this guy thinks that he can go away for weeks or whatever than decides to come back when an election is present just to make an endorsement


[01-Nov-19 08:42 PM] Youmaton#1190
According to our records, the Centre Alliance is a part of the government. Regardless of the endorsement, why do you think tonight turned out as it has?


[01-Nov-19 08:43 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I‚Äôm referring to the Liberal National Coalition


[01-Nov-19 08:44 PM] Youmaton#1190
Talking about the Liberal National Coalition, how has this byelection affected it? Are you still committed to this government after the Prime Minister's endorsement of the Centre Alliance?


[01-Nov-19 08:46 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I will be putting a vote up at the Federal Executive Council of the National Party tomorrow which will decide on the party‚Äôs future within this government and the Liberal National Coalition


[01-Nov-19 08:46 PM] Youmaton#1190
How do you expect this to turn out?


[01-Nov-19 08:46 PM] ripauntmay#0083
At this stage, i will be voting for the people and that decision will be announced tomorrow.


[01-Nov-19 08:48 PM] Youmaton#1190
Moving on, the National candidate for Pearce has come out swinging against the Centre Alliance calling them " a bunch of nutters that want thirteen year old ratbags assaulting people in the streets". Do you stand by the comments of your candidate?


[01-Nov-19 08:50 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd phrase it like that


[01-Nov-19 08:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
How would you phrase it?


[01-Nov-19 08:52 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I‚Äôd say that the Centre Alliance Party is nothing but failed centrists.


[01-Nov-19 08:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
If they have failed at being centrists, what are they actually then?


[01-Nov-19 08:55 PM] ripauntmay#0083
They are left wing, clearly with their support of the Candidate who wants an economic transition from Capitalism to socialism


[01-Nov-19 08:56 PM] Youmaton#1190
If I may ask, where did the Centre Alliance support the candidate that you accuse of supporting such a policy?


[01-Nov-19 08:58 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Their leader took to twitter to show their support of the Socialist candidate

Would you be able to highlight which particular tweet you are referring to?


[01-Nov-19 09:03 PM] ripauntmay#0083
She took to twitter to congratulate the Member and make ridiculous claims about the National Party


[01-Nov-19 09:04 PM] Youmaton#1190
Are you suggesting the Leader of the Centre Alliance congratulating a candidate on their victory counts as an endorsement of their policies?


[01-Nov-19 09:06 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I‚Äôm not only referring to that, during her ABC interview, she claimed that our candidate was a fascist, what about the Socialist candidate, a self described Socialist is just as bad as a fascist, I don‚Äôt see why she couldn‚Äôt call the socialist out. She claims to be a centrist but she isn‚Äôt, and PM Porridge is a Malcom Turnbull on steroids.


[01-Nov-19 09:08 PM] Youmaton#1190

Hello, and welcome to Australia Tonight


[02-Nov-19 09:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
Over the past 30 hours we have seen some historic scenes in our political history, from what looks to be a collapse of the Porridge government, to the left retaking Pearce after it fell to the Liberal Party at the last election. Tonight with us we have the very man who won that race, @NGSpy


[02-Nov-19 09:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
How are you?


[02-Nov-19 09:50 PM] NGSpy#8096
I'm great thank you.


[02-Nov-19 09:51 PM] NGSpy#8096
Especially because of the fact that I am the new MP for the people of Pearce


[02-Nov-19 09:51 PM] NGSpy#8096
Which I will serve dutifully in Canberra during debates in the House of Representatives.


[02-Nov-19 09:52 PM] NGSpy#8096
How are you @Youmaton ?


[02-Nov-19 09:53 PM] Youmaton#1190
Relatively well, thank you. Yesterday we saw you win with a swing of 2.5% towards the SDP, giving your party the seat. Was this expected?


[02-Nov-19 09:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
One should never expect voting results because they are ranged on too many factors. But the fact that I won the seat shows the immense support for my positions in politics and what should be done in this country.


[02-Nov-19 09:58 PM] Youmaton#1190
You came under fire during the campaign from your Nationals counterpart for "anti-capitalistic views", and for "wanting a transition from capitalism to socialism". Is this true, and how do you reply to these accusations?


[02-Nov-19 10:01 PM] NGSpy#8096
I would like to say that there is nothing inherently wrong with Democratic Socialism. The Nationals are misleading in the fact that they compare Democratic Socialism to Authoritarian states which is extremely misleading. I believe that everyone should have a fair shot at having a great life with sustainable income, affordable housing and  accessible food. The current model of capitalism doesn't do those things and only benefits the rich, especially with the added economic theory of 'trickle-down economics' which has been proven to not work. #downwithtrickledown


[02-Nov-19 10:05 PM] Youmaton#1190
What are your thoughts on the after-events of yesterday, particularly around the Nationals words towards yourself, the Centre Alliance and the Prime Minister?


[02-Nov-19 10:09 PM] NGSpy#8096
The Prime Minister has made a very interesting mode regarding the promoting of the Centre Alliance candidate as the best candidate in the by-election. The current government crisis is super interesting as it could pave way for a more left leaning government than before. The Nationals have mainly just accused me of being a socialist. To that I say, 'what's wrong with being a democratic socialist?' As I have said before, their knowledge of the difference between democratic socialism and authoritarianism seems to be very limited, going off what they have said on twitter and the campaign trail.


[02-Nov-19 10:13 PM] Youmaton#1190
There have been some concerns around the community due to the current parliamentary activity laws. Can you make a commitment to meeting those requirements?


[02-Nov-19 10:14 PM] NGSpy#8096
I am committed to serve my constituents of Pearce to be at debates and to vote on every bill that goes through the House of Representatives in Canberra.


[02-Nov-19 10:17 PM] Youmaton#1190
Theres been some question as to how you plan to fund your promise of "2 free degrees in University". How do you plan to finance this?


[02-Nov-19 10:19 PM] NGSpy#8096
I plan to raise the taxes on the rich and the corporations to a point where they are accountable and will give back to the Australian people, and if there is not enough tax to cover two free degrees, the government budget can go into deficit, as having two free degrees in university is vitally important for the job market. #australiaaintacompany


[02-Nov-19 10:20 PM] Youmaton#1190
Would you detail this taxation plan? Is this a simple rework of the tax system, or something more?


[02-Nov-19 10:23 PM] NGSpy#8096
The general idea is to get rid of the trickle-down economics model and taxation, and to make the top few rich people of Australia and companies accountable for their income, to give back to the Australian people. It will help immensely with the two free degree plan you have highlighted before, and also many other government projects that need funding. The middle class and the lower class will not have an increase in taxes, as they are already contributing enough to the budget.


[02-Nov-19 10:25 PM] Youmaton#1190
Will you be releasing a more detailed plan to finance this within the future? Some viewers at home may be concerned at the potential vagueness of what you wish to achieve


[02-Nov-19 10:25 PM] NGSpy#8096
Of course I will release a detailed plan in the future.


[02-Nov-19 10:25 PM] NGSpy#8096
How can it get into parliament otherwise?


[02-Nov-19 10:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
When might we expect this plan?


[02-Nov-19 10:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
I can give the constituents the outline of the taxation plan by the end of a fortnight.


[02-Nov-19 10:29 PM] Youmaton#1190
Finally, apart from your university pledge, what do you plan to achieve whilst in parliament this term?


[02-Nov-19 10:31 PM] NGSpy#8096
The other great promise I will try to achieve in parliament this term is to let the refugees from other countries into Australia, and provide housing and the best life we possibly can for them. Refugees increase the job market and the GDP, and we can definitely house them considering that we are the sixth largest country in land mass.

As the aftershock of the Pearce by-election continues to take effect across the nation, we have seen the leaders of the two major Coalition parties exchange hostile words over the Liberals endorsement of the Centre Alliance. Today I have with me the man who made that endorsement, Prime Minister @GenericCereal


[03-Nov-19 02:40 PM] Youmaton#1190
How are you Prime Minister?


[03-Nov-19 02:42 PM] Youmaton#1190
Well myself. Starting off, there has been some controversy over your decision to endorse fellow coalition partner the Centre Alliance. What do you say to those who have been exchanging words regarding this?


[03-Nov-19 02:45 PM] Youmaton#1190
Why do you believe the Nationals are reacting this way, if you had already warned them beforehand?


[03-Nov-19 02:48 PM] Youmaton#1190
Do tell?


[03-Nov-19 02:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
Soon after the results of the by-election, the Deputy Prime Minister came on this program and said that the decision had not been made yet. Do you believe he has changed his mind from his words with you, and if so would you let him return if he had?


[03-Nov-19 03:01 PM] Youmaton#1190
I will touch on the Bradfield scheme in just a moment, however there were questions around the future of this government, given what looks to be the departure of the Nationals. With an announced vote of no confidence from the SDP, what is next for your administration?


[03-Nov-19 03:05 PM] Youmaton#1190
As interns have just informed me, the Deputy Prime Minister has just accused you on twitter of lying about your communications to him regarding the centre alliance endorsement. How do you respond?


[03-Nov-19 03:11 PM] Youmaton#1190
Whilst we await the press conference from the Deputy PM, let's talk about your announced Bradfield project. There have been some environmental concerns raised around it, how can you assure Australians that this will not harm our native environment?


[03-Nov-19 03:15 PM] Youmaton#1190
(m: all good)


[03-Nov-19 03:17 PM] Youmaton#1190
"In the Murray-Darling we have large areas that are dying with not enough water because, essentially, we have taken the floods away,"

"You take all that water away and you put it somewhere else, you [then] get a collapse of those ecosystems, which has happened in the Nile Delta; it's happening in the Yangtze [in China] at the moment."

Diverting flood waters from their natural paths could cause wide movement of invasive species, collapse marine and estuary ecosystems, and even cause economic damage to coastal communities, according to experts.

He also pointed out that the Snowy Mountains Scheme was like a mini-Bradfield in that it had diverted water successfully to irrigators, although at the same time "it has devastated the [Snowy] river"."


[03-Nov-19 03:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
This was said by Professor Kingsford of UNSW

After a disaster poll, the party's electoral chances are looking less certain, but they still hold 3 out of 13 seats.


[28-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
It should be noted however, that there are also 2 vacant seats- the seats of Hotham and Mayo, held by MPs who have been ejected.


[28-Dec-19 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
What seats will the Liberals be hoping to win to regain government?


[28-Dec-19 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, one seat is Cunningham. Held on a .7% margin, the seat is traditionally left-wing but was won by literal joke candidate BHjr132 at the previous election.


[28-Dec-19 05:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Cunningham is the most marginal seat in the country, and will be one the Liberals need to retake the government.


[28-Dec-19 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Pearce was won by the Liberals at the previous election, but the SDP managed to seize it at a by-election.


[28-Dec-19 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
NGSpy holds the seat on 2.2% margin against the Nationals, who may also be looking to strike here.


[28-Dec-19 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
One interesting seat to note, albeit one unlikely to flip, is Mayo, which covers South Australia. A traditionally marginal seat, it's been held by MattMonti for 3 consecutive elections, but his expulsion may risk the hold of the SDP over Mayo. If she were to lose her seat, it would certainly be an upset.

[28-Dec-19 05:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
On the other side of politics, the Social Democrats have a number of seats they could gain. Winning Mayo is likely and would bring the party to 4 seats, but what about other seats?


[28-Dec-19 05:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Moncrieff was a UDP seat at the previous election, but PineappleCrusher_, the former Liberal MP for the seat, won it back at a by-election mid-term.


[28-Dec-19 05:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is the most marginal Liberal seat, on 3.1%.


[28-Dec-19 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
However, the Nationals also have fertile seats for the SDP.


[28-Dec-19 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Both Sydney, held by National leader Riley8583 on a 2.7% margin, and Hotham, vacant after superpacman04 was expelled, but still regardless held on a 6.4% margin, are possible opportunities.


[28-Dec-19 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
While the latter is classified as fairly safe, the expulsion may, as it may in Mayo, shake things up.


[28-Dec-19 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
The SDP seems to be targeting the seat of Robertson, having already announced the party's deputy leader JaydenDaGamer15 will contest there. The seat was won by independent Gregor_The_Beggar in a by-election and is held on a 7.3% margin.


[28-Dec-19 06:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
As for the new Labor Party, they'll be hoping to hold their seats. There hasn't really been any significant growth in ALP membership and so it's difficult to see where they even can stand at the moment.


[28-Dec-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
As for the National Party, they could likely target rural seats such as the earlier mentioned Pearce, or seek to make inroads in Queensland seats where the Liberals hold dominant.


[28-Dec-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
The United Democrats?


[28-Dec-19 06:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, we haven't heard much from them, and given all but one of the candidates they stood at the previous election aren't in the party, they risk deregistration. But presuming they continue, their likely goal will be to defend Lingiari, which brings me to...


[28-Dec-19 06:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Country Liberals.


[28-Dec-19 06:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, obviously, they're restricted to only the NT, and so their goal will be to regain Lingiari.

It seems we are already beginning with this, let's get on with the first question. To the panel, the last parliament saw multiple failed votes of no confidence, as well as an end of term budget that tied in the house. If you are (re)elected as Prime Minister, what would you do to bring stability to our political system, and how would you go about achieving this?


[05-Jan-20 06:43 PM] Youmaton#1190
As the incumbent, I'll allow @GenericCereal to go first.

[05-Jan-20 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Folks, if you‚Äôre looking for stability- you are looking for the Nationals. A strong leadership team with strong policies; we know what‚Äôs needed to keep Australia a strong prosperous nation. We have a strong membership base, with members who consistently run under the party banner and stock with our politics. The key to stability is a  strong leadership pushing a strong agenda and that‚Äôs what the Nationals stand for. We stand for Delivering for Australia!


[05-Jan-20 06:49 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I'm sorry Griffo, but a party that doesn't know whether it supports a government, isn't really that stable is it?


[05-Jan-20 06:50 PM] djello#5901
If I may answer the question - unfortunately the Australian Labor Party, being quite a new party, does not have enough members contesting this election to form a majority. As such, I would seek to work with other parties and/or independents. Unlike Prime Minister Porriidge, however, I will not mislead the President by claiming that I have more support in the House than I really do. And i think this is emblematic of deeper structural problems within the Liberal government. They kicked off on a very bad start by misleading the Australian public. Then we saw a spectacular display, where the Deputy PM and Nationals leader tore away from the Coalition and claimed that the Prime Minister was 'unfit for office'. So the Libs and Nats have already proven that they cannot be trusted to bring about the stability which our nation so desperately needs. I would set aside my ego, something that the PM and Nationals leader have been unable to do. I would look to others in parliament as we put aside our differences and do what is in the best interests of the country.

[05-Jan-20 06:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Look, the only party that would offer stability for the country is a party that will actually work with the parliament. No matter how many seats your party wins, your job is to work parliament as a Prime Minister. This is core to our democracy. The Social Democratic Party are the only party who would, if elected as the government, no matter the size of our majority, always seek to create the greatest consensus in parliament. Always talking with MPs in the opposition and crossbench to ensure the bills we pass represent the greatest amount of Australians.

For me, it's not really a relevant question, unless there was a deal with a coalition of parties that agreed to install an independent Prime Minster you'll never see that happen. I would point out to the Prime Minister that his government HAD the most seats this term or at least equal, yet they were as dysfunctional as many of the previous terms. I think what the party leaders need to do is to show prove they can lead, the past few terms we have not seen genuine leadership from the Prime Minister's office, whether it's through the dysfunction of the parties, the tenauous coalitions or just plain apathy. The government of Australia is only as strong as the person leading it, too often we've seen the leaders are not up to the task. That has to change before anything else.


[05-Jan-20 06:54 PM] djello#5901
You certainly did mislead the public and the President, Prime Minister. You have lead an absolutely shambolic government, you have had your coalition split in half, you had senior members defect. You are not capable of running this country.


[05-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now Matt, we‚Äôve been consistent on the issue, first we supported them, then we dropped out of a coalition and gave them confidence and supply and I think it‚Äôs safe to say we‚Äôve made amends. All married couples have their fights, but in the end they stick together. Both the liberal and national parties have had the same leader and same name throughout the term. Sure we may slide to the left on the benches and Pac-Man slided to the right in political opinion but at least we don‚Äôt cross cross on leadership or on our beliefs like your senators!

Because I've always been honest about it. I made it very clear that I disagreed with debate requirements when I ran as an independent for Mayo, then as the SA-BEST member, then as the SDP member. I have stated that I would not follow these requirements because I do believe in debating for the sake of debating. But as I stated in my speech to the SDP conference when I was elected as leader, that battle is a personal one. When I was elected leader I committed to my party and the people of Australia that I would not continue this fight as leader. I would continue this fight as Prime Minister either. I would follow the requirements for the benefit of the nation.

As an independent political party, we have a right to make our own decisions on certain issues and if we don‚Äôt agree with something the Liberals are doing, we‚Äôre not going to support them on it because we have integrity. We‚Äôre not the Liberals, we‚Äôre not Labor; we are the Nationals.

I mean Australia was still stable at the time. We didn‚Äôt have a recession, we didn‚Äôt have an increase in poverty and we didn‚Äôt have a military coup or religious council take over. Because we are a democratic nation and our opinions are all equally valued as members of parliament.


[05-Jan-20 07:13 PM] showstealer1829#6775
That's a very good question Yala. Whilst I did promise my confidence to the government, that doesn't mean idly waving through every bill they come up with, each bill still deserves to be judged on merit and impact on the people of my electorate, those that were detrimental to my constituents such as the government's cynical attempt to raise the GST would have been catastrophic to people already doing it tough. In terms of the No Confidence vote I abstained from. Had I known the Nationals were going to flip flop back around to support I would have honored my agreement and given my confidence to the government. However going into the vote it seemed certain the vote would pass and my view was and still is we are supposed to be better than that. Every time there is a dispute between parties the ultimate solution is always telling the voters their voes don't matter. That is wrong. We represent their views, all their views, not just those who voted for us. 
As for the future, if called on again to provide confidence to a government I would do the same thing. I would support them in confidence motions if I was sure I would be the deciding vote but confidence and supply doesn't mean a rubber stamp. I will continue to vote on each bill based on how it will effect my constituents, the people who trusted me to be their voice.


[05-Jan-20 07:15 PM] djello#5901
So you will only vote based on how others will vote?

I thought I made my point perfectly clear. The abstention was a statement. In future I would honor any confidence agreement. But confidence doesn't mean a rubber stamp for the government's agenda.

[05-Jan-20 07:25 PM] djello#5901
Well put quite simply, Labor would be willing to work with anyone in parliament. Now, as I have made quite clear, the reason the UDP government was short-lived was because the Prime Minister - then Liberal Opposition Leader - could not let go of his egotistical ways and brought forward a motion of no confidence. He didn't even want an election, he wanted to be swept in to power. And I made sure that the Australian people would decide who they wanted in government. Unfortunately the UDP was only able to field a very small pool of candidates, and subsequently the Liberal and National parties were able to form a coalition. I have always put my integrity first. I have always been honest with the Australian people. But as I said, Labor would be willing to work with whoever the Australian people elect to parliament. As I said in regards to the Liberals and Nationals - who have not been able to put aside their differences for the good of the nation, that I will put aside my differences. After the chaos and dysfunction of the Porriidge Government, Australians are craving stability. And stability will be ensured as part of a Labor government.

The first thing I want to is secure a drought solution that will help all Australians and especially those in my electorate of Nicholls. Our farmers are doing it tough and they need practical solutions, which is why I want to open up an inquiry into finding those. With all due respect to the Prime Minister Bradfield is not the solution, it does nothing for the people of Nicholls, it does nothing for the people of Western Australia, it's a limited scheme that will only help a limited number of people. That is not good enough for what we are going though and we need to stop debating over it and work on finding solutions that will help all Australians through this drought crisis we are going through.

Because the only way we will have time to address all these other issues is if we combat the Climate Crisis. There will be no government on a dead planet.

Well since I am only an independent I will only only speak for my seat. The seat of Nicholls. The people of Nicholls know that I will represent all of the people of Nicholls, not just those in the big cities or those who donate to my own coffers. I've stood up in this past term for the people of Nicholls, I've considered the impact of each and every bill that has been before the house on the people of Nicholls. Each day I am honored to be the representative of the people of Nicholls. 

But more than that I think most Australians are getting fed up of the way things are going, they're getting sick of the parties, sick of the backstabbing, sick of the constant attention grabbing that we've seen from some. They want someone that will listen to them and represent their needs. I want to continue to be that independent voice for the people of Nicholls and in an indirect way for the people of Australia as a whole. This election is an opportunity to send a message to the party poltical system, that we're fed up of the status quo and the instability. This is an election where people can take back control and choose people who will truly represent them rather than just those who will either only represent a few or just blindly follow orders. I personally think the choice is clear but that is not my decision to make. Ultimately the people have the power, I hope they use it wisely and I hope I can continue to be the representative for Nicholls.

Porridge is a good man with strong leadership qualities who fights for the people of Australia and knows what he‚Äôs doing, a very politically smart man with tactics to keep him in power.

Despite Matt and I being on opposite sides of the spectrum, he has displayed consistency in his vocal support for the issues he believes in and has the strength to put up with heavy attacks from the opposition and the media.

Dyljam is a good man and has been excellent in his role of criticising the government and sometimes even I admit he‚Äôs on point.

Finally, showstealer is a true community man who doesn‚Äôt believe in left policies or right policies but good policies to help his community and is more than willing to voice his criticisms which is a good thing in democracy.

Well to Matt first I would say. I don't always agree with everything you have stood for, I don't agree with all your parties policies. But you have shown that you do care for the people of Mayo and the people of Australia and despite disagreements on debating I hope the people of Mayo will give you another chance to do so again after this election.
To Griffo. Despite your bluster and your over the top ways you do still have your heart in the right place most of the time. I do disagree with you on a lot of things but you do show genuine passion for what you believe in and that is rare in politics nowadays
To the Prime Minister. You did a good job surviving the term even when it seemed unlikely, while we rarely agreed on policy I think you should be commended for seeing this government to term.
And to Dyljam. He's probably been one of my greatest rivals in parliament. But he does do his job so well, he really does care for the people he represents and despite our differences he is still someone I look up to in terms of how to conduct onesself as a member of parliament.

It's heartening to see the passion that these people, these candidates, have for their country. Now, there's no doubt that I disagree with many of the things said tonight. But I do believe that each of the candidates here tonight do genuinely wish to improve our nation, even if we disagree with their preferred vision, their preferred future for Australia. This election, the Labor Party is presenting an image of hope. We believe that the only way to move our country forward is when we all move together. Now, I understand that there may be some apprehension to our plan. But nonetheless, I believe that the most fundamental leadership quality is that of inclusion. This election, I hope Australians look towards a leader who can unite Australians, not sow discord within our communities or divide us for their own electoral gain. And as such, I am putting myself to the Australian people to do just that. The ALP cannot win a majority, but if we are in a position to form government, I will be looking to build consensus rather than highlighting our disagreements. In any case, I hope to work with the other parliamentarians whoever forms government. I think that's enough for me tonight. Thank you for running this debate Yala, and I also thank the other candidates for their participation tonight. Thank you everyone, and I wish you all the best come election day.


[05-Jan-20 08:51 PM] Youmaton#1190
That's it for the debate tonight. I would like to thank everyone who participated, despite some interuption, and I thank everyone at home for watching.

Hello, and welcome to AustraliaTonight. Tonight we have a special guest with us wishing to speak to the people of Brisbane as he attempts to reenter parliament. Please welcome Former Member for Moncrieff and Liberty Reform Leader @Plupsnup!


[03-Feb-20 08:05 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Hello!


[03-Feb-20 08:05 PM] Youmaton#1190
So Plupsnup, after your shock resignation last term that saw the election of PineappleCrusher in the subsequent by-election, what brings you back to politics?


[03-Feb-20 08:07 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I resigned due to mental health concerns affecting my state of being. What brings me back to politics is that I have recovered and I have rebooted a radical rendition of my first party


[03-Feb-20 08:07 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I want to help the people of Australia


[03-Feb-20 08:08 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Especially the lower and working class

[03-Feb-20 08:10 PM] Youmaton#1190
You have previously attempted the formation of a political movement numerous times, with your greatest success previously being 49% against the SDP in Sydney. What made you decide to form this movement again, instead of joining an existing one?


[03-Feb-20 08:12 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Well, my beliefs of how society should be governed and how the economy should be run do not align with any of the current major parties, so I thought it would be best to form my own


[03-Feb-20 08:16 PM] Youmaton#1190
Looking to your proposed manifesto, it brings forward a signature policy of a 100% land value tax. How can you justify taxation this high?


[03-Feb-20 08:21 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Well, the supply of land is fixed you see, so no matter the rate you tax land values at there will be no deadweight loss. The 100% rate is a long term goal of a forty year plan to replace taxes on labour, i.e income taxes, with taxes in land. It is the belief of the LRP that land shouldn't be considered property, as well as the fact that anyone shouldn't be punished for working hard. This is why the LRP believes that the federal government should replace income taxes with a federal LVT of a 100% rate


[03-Feb-20 08:28 PM] Youmaton#1190
There has been a range of criticism regarding the 100% LVT, with economist Adam Ozimek describing it as "problematic". What effect will this change in taxation policy have upon the economy, given your note that income tax should be scrapped once the federal LVT is implemented?


[03-Feb-20 08:34 PM] Plupsnup#9685
It would result in real wage growth by the elimination of the income tax, it would result in lower land prices as values would be determined by government agencies, it would result in the natural breaking up of land monopolies, any large business that owns land. Under certain conditions, by increasing the value of land through investment in surrounding areas such as housing, more roads, railways etc, revenue generated from the tax will increase


[03-Feb-20 08:36 PM] Youmaton#1190
Just to confirm, you are saying that taxation revenue will increase under 100% LVT?


[03-Feb-20 08:37 PM] Plupsnup#9685
As long as site values rise through investment in surrounding areas, yes


[03-Feb-20 08:40 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Let me restate my past comment about land not being considered property, it should be considered property, just that economic value derived by land should be taxed and  that land ownership is a privilege, not a right


[03-Feb-20 08:42 PM] Youmaton#1190
Looking towards parliament now, what are your thoughts on the current happenings there? What would you plan to achieve this term if elected?


[03-Feb-20 08:45 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I support NT and ACT statehood, and I support the apology to LGBTQ+ Australians. I also support looking into desalination technology. My one aim this term is to bring about a discussion the need for a constitutional bill of rights


[03-Feb-20 08:46 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Also


[03-Feb-20 08:47 PM] Plupsnup#9685
What I said previously about site values increasing due to investment is not a contradiction to what I said previously. Current land values are over-exaggerated by private speculation


[03-Feb-20 08:49 PM] Youmaton#1190
I do not believe anyone here mentioned it being or not being a contradiction, but that is noted


[03-Feb-20 08:49 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Just raising a point


[03-Feb-20 08:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
Regarding your policy of a constitutional bill of rights, what would this entail. What protections and provisions would be included, and how would a controversial situation such as with the United States's second amendment be avoided?


[03-Feb-20 08:59 PM] Plupsnup#9685
There will be no mention of a right to bear arms. There will be twenty amendments relating to civil and economic rights that should be guaranteed to all Australians. Some of these will be: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from discrimination, right to a fair paying  job, right to housing and many others that I will speak about at a rally tomorrow


[03-Feb-20 09:00 PM] Youmaton#1190
Couldn't measures such as constitutional freedom of speech and "freedom from discrimination" conflict somewhat?


[03-Feb-20 09:04 PM] Plupsnup#9685
If the discrimination is based upon immutable characteristics, then it would be considered unlawful. You can't discriminate based on race, but you on other things such as political opinion


[03-Feb-20 09:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
Bringing forward a classic example. If a baker were to refuse to make a cake for a same-sex couple on the basis of religion, would this be allowed under freedom of religion, or banned under freedom from discrimination? Where does one right begin and another end?


[03-Feb-20 09:09 PM] Plupsnup#9685
It would be banned under freedom from discrimination as the sexuality of the couple is immutable


[03-Feb-20 09:10 PM] Plupsnup#9685
You can not discriminate against someone based on something they can't change


[03-Feb-20 09:11 PM] Youmaton#1190
How about in a different example. Would said baker be allowed to refuse service to a member of the furry community?

So your proposal will not cover freedom of expression?


[03-Feb-20 09:17 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I will have to check with others when drafting the clause, but from my understanding being a furry isn't the same as being a member of LGBTQ+ community. I may be wrong so bear my ignorance


[03-Feb-20 09:18 PM] Plupsnup#9685

That's probably a good place to wrap up. Do you have any last comments, or messages to say to the electorate of Brisbane?


[03-Feb-20 09:23 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Just that a vote for the gnats is a vote for fascism, and that if you vote for me, I will give the people of Brisbane, and to a greater extent, Australia, the freedom that they deserve and need


[03-Feb-20 09:23 PM] Plupsnup#9685

Hello, and welcome to AustraliaTonight. Tomorrow the people of Brisbane and Denison participate in one of our most frequent parliamentary traditions, a byelection due to the exit of an MP.


[08-Feb-20 05:08 PM] Youmaton#1190
Today we have the Nationals candidate for Denison, former Minister Superpacman04!


[08-Feb-20 05:08 PM] Pacman#0709
Hello!


[08-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Youmaton#1190
To begin with, what brings you to Tasmania instead of your usual seat of Hotham? What do you believe you can bring to Denison?


[08-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Pacman#0709
Well I think I've made it clear in my campaign that I am bringing a new perspective and a fresh face to Tasmania, which is something Tasmania hasn't had in nearly 2 and a half years!


[08-Feb-20 05:12 PM] Youmaton#1190
2 and a half? If you are referring to Dyljam, he's held the seat since June 2018, a year less then you claim.


[08-Feb-20 05:13 PM] Pacman#0709
Ah please excuse my mistake. I'm a bit tired from the campaign.


[08-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Youmaton#1190
Understandable. Regarding your note of being a "new face", what do you believe you can bring policy wise that other candidates may not?


[08-Feb-20 05:16 PM] Pacman#0709
I believe that I am bringing the only real right wing option for Denison. Since, apparently there is a Liberal candidate. I believe that I am the only candidate who is fighting for policies that will boost Tasmania's income and put more money in the pockets of the people of Tasmania.


[08-Feb-20 05:19 PM] Youmaton#1190
Your party has brought up varying levels of controversy throughout the parliament, with accusations of homophobia and promoting KKK slogans. What are your thoughts upon this, and does your leadership team retain your confidence?


[08-Feb-20 05:21 PM] Pacman#0709
I don't think that these accusations are true, while I will acknowledge that some of our members are controversial. As a member of the Nationals Leadership I believe that we have a pretty great team leading us.


[08-Feb-20 05:23 PM] Youmaton#1190
Do you agree with the statements of said leadership individuals?


[08-Feb-20 05:24 PM] Pacman#0709
I may not agree with them, but we live in a democracy and I am proud to say that they have a right to believe what they believe.


[08-Feb-20 05:25 PM] Youmaton#1190
If you are elected, what is the first thing you plan to do?


[08-Feb-20 05:26 PM] Pacman#0709
If I am elected my first course of action will be looking into investing in infrastructure and certain industries in Tasmania.


[08-Feb-20 05:26 PM] Pacman#0709

[08-Feb-20 05:27 PM] Pacman#0709
I'm afraid a minor emergency has come up and I'm going to have to leave it at that.

[12-Feb-20 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think that this shows that the Australian people have had enough. I mean, honestly, I went from being an activist who shows up to rallies in a silly costume to MP in like 2 weeks. The status quo won't work any longer, and I think it's telling that both the Liberals and the SDP have performed poorly.

[12-Feb-20 06:43 PM] mikiboss#2416
I think that BabyYodaVevo does have a point in that this is somewhat of a loss for Establishments 'Politics-as-usual'. While I do agree that these are shocking election results, I do think we should acknowledge that these are by-elections, which turn out trends which often are not reflective of what we see at the National state. I would contend however that this was a defeat for establishment politician, Given Dyljan had held the seat of Denison since June 2018, and the Liberals had held Brisbane for such a long period of time.


[12-Feb-20 06:45 PM] mikiboss#2416
I do also think that there should be more focus on the candidates who were successful on polling day, Given BabyYodaVevo themselves are not just an activist, but also an avowed socialist. In addition, SuperPacman04 is somewhat of a more moderate member of the Nationals who has shown themselves in Debates to occasionally agree with the SDP and other progressives on certain issues more than the Nationals Leadership.

[12-Feb-20 06:48 PM] Deleted User#0000

In my opinion.


[12-Feb-20 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'll admit I'm not the most educated person on water security or droughts, but meteorologists as far back as 1945 concluded that the expected increase in rainfall wouldn't occur. It'd be excessively expensive- and for what?


[12-Feb-20 06:52 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The Bradfield Scheme 2.0 is excellent, instead of pumping water through the great dividing range, it is gravity fed which makes it cheaper and more efficient to build, it will also revitalise the QLD agricultural sector, it will also allow for the production of hydroelectricity which will lower the cost of electricity and supply power to an estimate of 80 thousand homes. I think that it‚Äôs silly that you say that, it‚Äôs been raining a lot lately and there hasn‚Äôt been any sign of it slowing, I wouldn‚Äôt base decisions off of estimations that were made in 1945.

[12-Feb-20 06:57 PM] mikiboss#2416
Two of the issues I believe the Bradford scheme has is time and money. The fact is that if we are going to need a solution for people who are in regional QLD and NSW, we need something which can be implemented which will deliver resources to them as soon as possible. Estimates vary, but some more conservative estimates place the construction time at roughly a decade, and there is no guarantee it will deliver water for the basin. and that's without counting the multi-billion dollar price tag which it is estimated at costing.

[12-Feb-20 07:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, the question certainly seems attractive. I think certainly we should have a system in place to unseat MPs who have committed crimes or abused their office or powers, but whoever decides what counts as an abuse will have a heck of a lot of power. I agree with it, but I think that what is classified as such an abuse should be made independently from the government and from Parliament.


[12-Feb-20 07:01 PM] mikiboss#2416
I personally believe that there is merit to the proposal, and I think that there are similar models in other countries which can be evaluated. The United Kingdom has a system whereby a constituencies are able to make a petition which, when it reaches a threshold, it forces a by-election. I think that there is an argument for the case of committing an offence, however abuse of power would be more difficult to define.


[12-Feb-20 07:02 PM] Youmaton#1190
@ripauntmay ?


[12-Feb-20 07:02 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I think this is a very touchy issue, however to hold accountability in parliament, I think Members should be thoroughly investigated by a crime and corruption commission which will determine whether they are in breach of the code of conduct, if they are found in breach, they should be recalled as members of the Australian parliament.

Question from the Member for Moncrieff - "My question for #QandA: What do each of you think of foreign, domestic, corporate and other monetary interests in our politicians and political parties?"


[12-Feb-20 07:03 PM] mikiboss#2416
I mean I think it's fair to say I'm not a fan


[12-Feb-20 07:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not a fan of money in politics in general, to be honest. I think, personally, only self-funding or small-dollar funding should be allowed.


[12-Feb-20 07:05 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Firstly I don‚Äôt think we should have any foreign monetary interests in Australian politicians and Australian political parties, I think that domestic grassroots organisations should play a role in politics and political parties, regarding corporate donations I don‚Äôt think they should be allowed.

But in all seriousness, Democracy is a difficult beast, and what classified as an interest is often difficult to define. Now I don't think anyone is supportive of these influences in our politics, and I would agree. I think that there are broad measures which all governments, be they Liberal, National, Labor, SDP or otherwise should look into legislating to ensure that these interests and possible conflicts of interests are as transparent and clear as possible. One it is clear to everyone, they can have their say at the ballot box.


[12-Feb-20 07:11 PM] mikiboss#2416
I do however want think that the Leader of the Opposition does make a good point when talking about grassroots organisation. Democracy should be more than just going to a ballot box every so often, and people do have the right to be politically active in groups campaigning for their respective goals.

My question for #QandA: What are your thoughts on the Harbor Bridge incident?"


[12-Feb-20 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, as you know, I released a press release on it recently. It is incredibly sad to hear of what's occured, and I am incredibly thankful that the majority of passengers made it out safe and unscathed. I think that the federal and state governments should work together to launch an investigation to find the truth of the incident.


[12-Feb-20 07:20 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I have already released a statement on this however I‚Äôm with Yoda on this, I think that state and federal governments should launch an investigation.


[12-Feb-20 07:21 PM] mikiboss#2416
The Sydney Harbor Bridge is an icon of Sydney and it is shocking to hear this news. Concur with BabyYodaVevo's statement on being thankful that most of the passengers were unscathed. While it is clear that the Port Authority does have a good amount of responsibility for this, I do comment the minister for announcing an investigation with the ATSB, since I think it is pretty unanimous here that increased State and Federal cooperation on matters of investigation like this are welcome

Hello, and welcome to AustraliaTonights first election debate. This campaign has been an interesting one, with the Leader of the Opposition facing his toughest challenge to his electorate in a long time. Can Riley hold on, or will we see the return of Gregor. Tonight we hear from these two Sydney candidates, and we get their views on current happenings.

To begin...

The COVID-19 has seen a serious hit to Sydney, with buisnesses having to shut down as residents enter self isolation and the economy begins to hibernate. If elected, what are your plans to help Sydney continue on past this crisis?


[02-Apr-20 07:46 PM] Youmaton#1190
I'll start with Gregor


[02-Apr-20 07:51 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Thank you for the question and I recognize the real concerns and stories behind every single leg of this current shutdown period. 

We cannot describe the economy as hibernating people, we can only describe the economy as slumping fully. I cannot lie to you like many in this country try and do and say that this is a temporary thing which will be solved. I've gone through Sydney, block by block, and I've spoken to good hard-working Australians who have found themselves laid off. I'm currently sponsoring a friend of mine to allow him to keep the power running and keep food on the table after he lost his job in the airline industry recently. This is a time which calls for serious action from both sides of the economic spectrum to solve and I'm the only one on this stage who can commit to policy positions from both sides. 

If elected, my plan is to revitalize Sydney to fulfill a vision for this city where we have ease of access to public transit to get our city and our economy moving. I imagine a city where the Federal Government can use our citizen's tax dollars and invest it directly back into keeping our businesses and our jobs afloat. I imagine a Sydney where we can thrive and flourish as hard-working Australians and in which no one, no matter their status as elderly or disabled, can make a fair go of life and will not be left ruined by Covid-19. 

I'm afraid my opponent is too used to partisan political squabbles and the affairs of party politics to take future hard decisions which would be the right decisions to make but contradict his party views. If we needed to raise taxes to fund a vital piece of legislation which would save thousands of Australian jobs, could we trust the Leader of the Opposition to deliver it? I leave that question to Sydney voters who can see that the status quo isn't working and demand a change.


[02-Apr-20 07:53 PM] Youmaton#1190
@ripauntmay, your response?


[02-Apr-20 08:06 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Well firstly Yala, i would like to thank whoever submitted this question and remind them that i am here for you during these tough times, anyone who feels as if they need support contact my office and we can get that sorted out for you.

now onto the question, as a member of the Federal National Cabinet i have the honour to work alongside the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to ensure that not only sydneysiders but Australians can get through this crisis, i have given the Government my support for stimulus packages and i will continue to give my support for these packages.

The people of Sydney are hurting as a result of this COVID-19 outbreak, we have small businesses that have been operating for over a decade shutting down because they cant afford to keep on employees. My heart goes out to them, we have medium businesses that have also had to sack workers, as a result of this, over  the last week thousands of sydneysiders were lining up for centrelink just so that they could provide food on the table for their families, this brings a tear to my eye to see how many vulnerable australians have lost their jobs.

in closing because i dont want to make this too long, i have and will continue to support any stimulus package this govenment introduces, packages which give direct relief to the Sydneysiders and communities that need it, packages which ensure Sydneysiders can continue to provide for their families, i will not stoop myself so low like this independent has done, pedi none factual attacks in regards to partisanship, my speech in parliament relating to this outbreak called on the government to act bipartisan during these very tough times. We have finally  got some progress and i will be glad to continue to support any legislation which benefits the Australian people during these very tough times!


[02-Apr-20 08:07 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Can I respond to that for a quick second moderator?


[02-Apr-20 08:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
Of course


[02-Apr-20 08:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I just have a question to ask of the Leader of the Opposition

Does this mean if a package came up which would involve increased taxes but saved thousands of Australian jobs, would he firmly support it?


[02-Apr-20 08:10 PM] Youmaton#1190
@ripauntmay your response?


[02-Apr-20 08:16 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I would support a loan system in replace of tax hikes, the great thing about a loan system is that we get the money back whilst businesses can continue to provide direct support for the community, i would also support working with the banks to deliver loans on top of government loans, if there were forms of tax increases that were temporary i would consider however Australians should not be facing the brunt of tax hikes during an already existent jobs and health crisis, because it would be utterly irresponsible


[02-Apr-20 08:17 PM] Youmaton#1190
A question to Riley. Once the pandemic has concluded, and the borders reopen, do you believe immigration levels should return to prior levels? The viewer also asks your thoughts on multiculturalism.


[02-Apr-20 08:23 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I thank the viewer for their question

I think that this pandemic has been a real wake up call for this government, immigration levels should most definitely be reconsidered, this is not only because of this crisis but also because of the major strain that high levels of immigration has on our infrastucture, health and other services. I support multiculturalism as long as foreign citizens dont form their own commuity that essentially divides australians from non traditional Australian citizens, we should be a united nation, not a nation with one culture suburbs.


[02-Apr-20 08:24 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
What does the Leader of the Opposition mean by "Australians from Non-traditional Australians"?


[02-Apr-20 08:26 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Traditional Australians are considered to be Australians which dont form seperate communities on the basis of cultural identity.


[02-Apr-20 08:29 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Well, I think Traditional Australians are people who believe in values of liberty and fraternity who are perfectly happy to celebrate people who mingle with each other just as much as the desire for some groups to have a direct symbol of their own culture and to have something they can celebrate together. There are issues formed from historical neglect of minorities in this country which has led to these seperate communities forming. If the Leader of the Opposition wanted to end that, they'd address these concerns rather than campaign for incredibly strict immigration.


[02-Apr-20 08:33 PM] Youmaton#1190
A question to Gregor. Parliaments since the 2017 incident have varied greatly, however in common we have seen no majority be formed. In the case of you controlling the balance of power, how would you decide who to back and who would you back?


[02-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm sorry, may I make a statement on Immigration as it's a key part of my platform first if you don't mind? I think there are many Sydney voters who are concerned about it


[02-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
Of course


[02-Apr-20 08:37 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@Youmaton  To answer your question ahead of time, I believe that when this crisis is over that immigration levels should not just be returned to prior levels but that immigration law should also be radically liberalized as well.

We have an untapped economic boon in this country which we are preventing from entering our economy due to stigma. Immigration is proven to increase GDP per capita, increase spending in our economy meaning that local businesses earn more and fills shortages in our labour force during times of stability.

The National Party and Riley have played to nationalist sentiment and proposed policies which would heavily restrict Immigration. They want a system where one immigrant leaves and another comes in and where migrants are forced to go to the rural countryside which violates their right to freedom of movement. Furthermore, they have said they wish to amend citizenship law presumably to restrict the ease of acess to citizenship in this country. I know that the Leader of the Opposition is a Christian man and I ask him to read that bible in front of him and read the following sections.

I would like to answer that


[02-Apr-20 08:39 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We cannot have an Australia where a man who claims to be a Christian ignores the text of the Bible and tries to create a separate law for migrants in this country!


[02-Apr-20 08:42 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
To answer the moderators question from earlier,

I would make my choice known publicly to the Australian people that the prospective Government which promises me policy which will deliver good solutions to the people of Sydney which liberalizes our immigration law, which builds public transit in this country and which protects jobs and business is a Government I support. I want to support a Government which will deliver on my issues and stand by the groups I have fought for my whole life.


[02-Apr-20 08:43 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This candidate talks about the supposedly great effects of mass migration, yet he fails to mention nations like Germany who have opened their borders and as a result, there has been a significant rise of terrorism, speaking of migration, if you look at nations like China and India for example, these nations are clear examples of why overpopulation has failed, what we need is a steady rate of immigration, a rate which allows for our services, infrastucture and health system to keep up, this candidate seems to speak about all of the short term so called positive effects of mass migration however he fails to acknowledge the long term effects, Australia needs to catch up first, and only the National Liberal Coalition will push for policies which allow the nation to catch up.

Hello, my name is Yala Talama, and welcome to tonights special coverage of the AustraliaTonight Leaders Debate. As the campaign rages on, we have seen the battles from electorate to electorate pan out as Nationals attempt to take power from the incumbent SDP government. Can they do it, or will NGSpy follow in the footsteps of one of his predecessors and achieve 2 back to back terms? Let's hear from the Leaders here live.

[03-Apr-20 07:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
The first question is to both of you.

We have seen a major hit to our economy over the past few months, with COVID-19 leading Australian businesses into hibernation in order to stop the spread of the disease. What will you do if elected to help rebuild our economy post-covid?


[03-Apr-20 07:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
I'll start with Riley.


[03-Apr-20 07:38 PM] NGSpy#8096
*tilts head dramatically to look in the direction of Riley*


[03-Apr-20 07:48 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Thank you for the question, if I am elected Prime Minister, I will continue with the current National Cabinet to ensure that both the Opposition and government can continue to get a say on policy in regards to COVID-19. 

The Government I lead will firstly take drastic action, i would ask that all state governments close their borders to interstate travel to curb the increase of COVID-19 over the spread of other states.

I would also work closely with the Department of Home Affairs to ensure that our national borders can be completely closed to the outside world because what we need to do is contain what‚Äôs within our borders.

The current incumbent government has failed to listen to my advice on halting foreign investment in Australia, our economy is in a very weakened state and now is the perfect time for foreign vultures to purchase Australian assets, this must stop and will stop under my government.

I find it shameful of the Berejiklian government for allowing a cruise ship to port in Sydney without any quarantine, this should have been reviewed by this government and presented to the national cabinet yet it wasn‚Äôt.

My government will introduce stimulus packages which will then assist businesses in rebuilding and coming out stronger, whilst also supplying packages and welfare payments to jobseekers and workers who have been out of work as a result of COVID-19. 

Lastly, if elected Prime Minister, I will ensure that Australia comes out of this crisis with all of our fruit in the basket.


[03-Apr-20 07:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
You mention the closure of interstate borders. Would this be Tasmanian style 14 day quarantine or a Western Australia hard border?


[03-Apr-20 07:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
(m: @ripauntmay)


[03-Apr-20 07:53 PM] ripauntmay#0083
That would have to be discussed more thoroughly with states and the national cabinet however i would support either.


[03-Apr-20 07:55 PM] Youmaton#1190
Are you aware of the limitations you may face whilst doing a Western Australian style approach?


[03-Apr-20 07:56 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I would allow for exceptions, in regards to a Western Australia like approach, and as I said I would discuss with states on which approach they think is best.


[03-Apr-20 07:57 PM] Youmaton#1190
Prime Minister, your response to the initial question?


[03-Apr-20 08:02 PM] NGSpy#8096
I thank Yala for bringing up this very relevant debate topic. The COVID-19 crisis is on everyone's minds at the moment, and it is important to consider the financial **AND** social consequences of the virus in general. This government has passed a motion which assembles a national cabinet and have already made a plan for the stimulus packages to help Australia along in this crisis. We have also instigated the declaration of a human bio-security emergency, which allows the government to exercise powers to properly practice necessary measures for social distancing to mitigate the spread of coronavirus.

It is important now more than ever that we can have a government that can evaluate the consequences of coronavirus and act to mitigate those consequences thoroughly and can listen along with evaluate advice from other parties and especially medical professionals. When we get into government, we will release a stimulus package that will benefit Australian businesses by encouraging them to invest more, which will stimulate the economy properly. We will also fund and institute Temporary Australia Retainer Payments (TARP) of 80% of employee's wages all around Australia. This will make it so that companies will not have to pay as much towards their workers and have as much economic strain to them due to the crisis, and it encourages them to keep people employed instead of laying them off. These combined with the policies in the COVID-19 Statement of the government will be the policies the SDP will implement economically. Socially, we will make sure to follow the advice of medical professionals to practice social distancing as much as possible to mitigate the amount of cases in Australia as a whole. The SDP will make sure to keep you safe, long story short.

[03-Apr-20 08:06 PM] Youmaton#1190
Will this Retainer Payments package be similar to programs introduced in the United Kingdom by the Conservative Government?


[03-Apr-20 08:09 PM] NGSpy#8096
These retainer payments in similar in percentage, but the way it's applied is different. The payments implemented by the Johnson Government in the most recent budget created by them pays 80% of employee's wages **when they are not working because of coronavirus reasons**. There is also a significant problem of self-employed citizens of the United Kingdom not gaining anything out of it. TARP will cover sole-traders and self-employed people, and it will cover 80% of employee's wages **when they are working for 6 months**. Similar percentage, but different effects.

How much are you estimating this new program to cost?


[03-Apr-20 08:12 PM] NGSpy#8096
I shall estimate that this new program to cost about 200 billion dollars due to accounting for every employee's wages being different in Australia and that we are accounting for a percentage and not a flat cost. It will be a big price to pay for the Australian people and businesses in Australia to keep afloat, but the benefits outweigh the costs.

The next question is on immigration:

What are your plans for immigration once Australia's borders can be reopened?


[03-Apr-20 08:18 PM] NGSpy#8096
I plan to continue as was before, with the points based immigration system, but with some possible automatic residency to our neighbors in the pacific like New Zealand and Samoa and possibly even encourage refugees to be accommodated into Australian society. Refugees have been through so much to be even considered a refugee, and Australia should care for them. We can house them due to the amounts we have dedicated to public housing in the budget of around 5 billion dollars, which can benefit both regular Australians and potential refugees coming to Australia.

I know the Nationals are going to say ''The refugees don't deserve to be here, we need to house just Australians!'', but clearly they have no empathy for people who often have to fight brutal battles against the world to try and get to the country they choose, and it should be an honour that they choose Australia above all else!

Well firstly, if elected Prime Minister, I will work with the Home Affairs Minister to review the current Immigration rate, I would support lowering the current yearly threshold from 250,000 to 50,000.

The Prime Minister thinks that having a mass migration approach is an excellent policy, well to put it simply it‚Äôs not, I will not sign Australia up to any United Nations pact forcing us to hand over control of our borders unlike this Prime Minister.

I also don‚Äôt think that the Australian taxpayer should be funding migrant housing, when these migrants currently are allowed to work in this nation, these refugees are allowed to work in this nation, why supply housing to people that are capable of working, this government clearly doesn‚Äôt care about welfare rort and wasting billions on dollars on people that can physically work.

I will also look at reimplementing Offshore detention and increase funding towards the turn back of asylum seeker vessels.

My government will clearly send a message to those traffickers who are sending asylum seekers to this nation. Now the Prime Minister speaks of empathy, well Prime Minister, many of these migrants are economic migrants searching for a welfare state, wallah under this current government that is exactly what Australia is and is exactly why refugees choose Australia over other nations.

I would also support a policy in regards to granting South African farmers asylum in Australia as these people are escaping actual persecution from their racist government.

Opposition Leader, do you have the costings for decreasing immigration by 200,000 and reintroducing offshore detention?


[03-Apr-20 08:34 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I am not the Treasurer, and would get the home affairs department to draft a report on the costing of these changes, from earlier reports the cost of reintroducing offshore detention could cost from 1 billion to 5 billion, however I wouldn‚Äôt rely on the reports alone and wait for the department of Home Affairs to draft a report in regards to both of these matters.


[03-Apr-20 08:36 PM] Youmaton#1190
On the matter of offshore detention, many international organisations condemned Australia's prior use of offshore detention labelling it as a breach of human rights. How do you respond to such criticisms knowing they will surely return if the policy is reintroduced?

Well firstly, I will not succumb to foreign bureaucratic organisations that demand or claim such treacherous things, if you look at the United Nations human Rights council for example, the council is full of nations which abuse human rights, I mean literally abuse, there is Venezuela a nation which runs its people over in the streets, and other Middle Eastern Nations which restrict female rights, nations which endorse totalitarian ideals, so i would think it‚Äôs utterly irresponsible of them to judge us when they are doing far worse.

It would surely be better for Australia to not have to stoop down so low as to have to excuse themselves from judgement countries who have literally abused human rights and to avoid the possible risk of having to answer to the United Nations Human Rights Council in the first place wouldn't it? The one true way to avoid stupidity is to not enact stupidity. Don't make the possibility of abusing human rights, and we don't risk 'being bullied by foreign bureaucratic bodies'.

This Prime Minister claims that having humane offshore detention centres will somehow cause dispute in regards to human rights well quite simply it won‚Äôt. If this government truly cared about human rights it would have a far stronger approach towards resolving homelessness, after all our homeless citizens deserve far more than economic refugees that have many other developed nations to go to.

Thank you for the question,

The first policy that a National Liberal Government would implement would be taxation cuts included in an economic package which would be crafted by the current Shadow Treasurer, these policies would consist of stimulus for businesses and payment increases for Australians who are currently on government provided welfare. Fighting COVID-19 and supporting the Australian people through these tough times is an uttermost priority and will be at the top of my agenda when I enter the office of Prime Minister.


[03-Apr-20 09:06 PM] Youmaton#1190
Alrighty, closing statements. Opposition leader I'll let you go first.


[03-Apr-20 09:13 PM] ripauntmay#0083
People of Australia, you have a clear choice this election, I bring to the table bold clear policies, policies that will help us get through this health and jobs crisis. My priority will be serving you, I have lead a united Coalition of two party‚Äôs which has stuck together through thick and thin whilst the Prime Minister leads a party that will most likely split again. 

The Coalition will provide Australia with tax cuts to your income and business, we will abolish the GST on your electricity bill which will reduce the cost of your electricity by 9.1%. 

Our plan is to make Australia a nation which can stand strongly on its own without the reliance of economic powerhouses like China who have so much influence on our economy, now is the time to bring back manufacturing to this nation, now is the time to truly unleash this nations economic abilities, what we will continue to see under this left wing government is a restricted choked economy that cannot provide jobs and sustainable growth.

In closing, Australians we must come together, please support the National Liberal Coalition because together we can build a better tomorrow.

Thank you and goodnight and I would also like to thank the Prime Minister for being an excellent debater on this fine evening.

Prime Minister, your closing statement?


[03-Apr-20 09:22 PM] NGSpy#8096
People of Australia, you have a clearer choice this election. I bring to the table stability, a future and reputation for both. The Social Democratic Party cares about you all as individual people whom each need certain things to fully fulfill life to the fullest, and we know this, which is why we make policies that target certain groups that may find it harder to experience life to the fullest compared to most people, in hopes that overlapping these certain groups with people creates needs for every person in Australia.

The SDP will fight the COVID-19 crisis first, and mitigate the damage it causes to the economy and to society, and then it will focus on implementing policies for the future and for everyone, because that is what we are for. We are not just for rich Australians, or straight Australians, or christian Australians, because we are for **ALL** Australians and for a brighter future of this nation. I implore you all to vote for the SDP again this election.

I would like to thank Yala for hosting this event and for the Leader of the Opposition for being an excellent challenger this great evening as well.

With the Prime Minister winning this seat by a slim margin last election, it appears the Nationals opportunity to pull a Howard-esc dethroning has long passed. His activity in parliament combined with his high personal popularity means that this seat joins a handful of electorates where the result is near pre-determined.

Currently held by the retiring Caelius of the SDP, who won the seat in a surprise victory over the Country Liberals last election, Lingiari has been a two way race throughout this election as we have seen Copelonian of the SDP go up against CardboardGradient of the Nationals. Whilst both sides have been campaigning heavily, the atmosphere has changed within recent days, and Copelonian's campaign team seem to have been able to better utilise the new campaigning circumstances.

The race that stopped the nation last election, won by a slim margin by the Liberals who expanded said margin in a subsequent byelection, has a returning face trying to regain their seat. Matt Monti of the SDP is up against Centipede77 of the Nationals, however it seems that the coalition have given up this seat in order to focus on other target seats such as Robertson and Cunningham. Due to the incumbent MP BloodyChrome making a last minute move to the Canberra race, Mayo will be an easy seat to call.

ARichTeaBiscuit of the SDP has built upon what SocialistAcid had created last election, and produced a campaign which polls are predicting will come first in first preferences. The Newspoll released last night shows a nightmare scenario for the Liberals, with ARichTeaBiscuit on 43.4%, 1Rusted31 of the Nationals on 29%, and TheAudibleAsh on 27.6%. This race has been tightening as the days have gone on, as the SDP try to get a first preference vote high enough to overcome extremely friendly first preferences between the two coalition partners. This seat remains uncertain due to the nature of this campaign, and thus we believe this seat is...

[06-Apr-20 10:10 AM] Youmaton#1190
Home to the surprise victory of Independent candidate Zak over the now former treasurer PineappleCrusher last election, it was expected that the independent MP would attempt to find another term here. Zak has instead chosen to contest the seat of Brisbane, leaving this seat to be contested between the Nationals, the SDP, and the newly formed Australian Greens. Last nights Newspoll shows the Nationals facing a victory in the seat with 50.2% for their candidate My13InchDuck, with former Minister Zhukov236 of the SDP on 39.6%, and TheOWOTriangle of the Australian Greens on 10.2%. Given the lack of a SDP campaign in Moncrieff this election, it does come as a surprise that their polling remains this high, and might suggest that this seat has become a wasted opportunity for the government looking for a second term. National candidates such as Griffo and Riley have both entered parliament with slim margins initially, but have since grown their margins due to their activity in parliament and lack of challengers. This may be a seat the SDP will come to regret, but only time will tell.

It is clear that the SDP have a wide advantage over the Coalition this election, who have to win Cunningham and Capricornia in order to form government. Unless the SDP produce an electoral landslide in and secure an incredibly unlikely historic parliamentary majority, it is likely that a similar arrangement that holds as present will continue.

The first question goes to the major parties. This election has seen things tighten considerably over the past few days, with polls showing this is anyone's game. How confident are you in your campaign, and do you believe that you will see victory this week?

I am not confident, I'm probably gonna lose. Kinda sad but you know, you can't win everything.


[06-Apr-20 07:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
I feel it is extremely unwise to make predictions to the future, but the polling suggests we are doing quite well in the electorates where we are putting resources into, in that sense I hope to do well overall, but I do not feel that it would be courteous for me to make a solid prediction as anything can happen.


[06-Apr-20 07:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have consistently been confident in the coalition throughout this campaign and as the director, I have always maintained that we will do well and will widen our party base regardless if we win government or retain opposition. From the start, I‚Äôve always said that if you have a go, you get a go and the Coalition has certainly had a go which is being reflected in some magnificent polls.

Ooo we have an urgent question to the Independents from an audience member.


[06-Apr-20 07:46 PM] NGSpy#8096
*waits patiently for Yala to ask the next question*


[06-Apr-20 07:47 PM] Youmaton#1190
Since the 2017 incident, we have never seen a single party reach a parliamentary majority, always relying on a coalition or strong C&S. The viewer asks what the independents thoughts are on the current state of the major parties, and who they might support in the case of another hung parliament?


[06-Apr-20 07:48 PM] Youmaton#1190
@Zak @showstealer1829 @Gregor The Beggar


[06-Apr-20 07:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Currently, it appears that while both major parties have serious concerns about their own faults and issues, I'm seemingly more inclined currently to go into coalition with the Social Democratic Party in the case of a hung parliament as the National Party has not earned my trust on my key major issues of Immigration, Minority Rights and other fields.

However, the Social Democratic Party I do worry has had serious concerns with how they've operated in some capacities and I think there definitely needs to be a voice holding them accountable on behalf of Sydney. Right now, the people of Sydney deserve a liberal democratic voice which stands up for Sydney values and those values will ultimately be determined by their confidence in me and what issues they come to me about. I wish to be accountable to the decisions of the people of Sydney and listen to their voice as to who their representative should sit at the table with.


[06-Apr-20 07:51 PM] Zak#6496
Well Yala, as you know this term I have supported the SDP Government through C&S. I am proud of being able to do so, being able to pass a budget whilst maintaining my own thoughts on other bills. It has also allowed me to keep the Government and Opposition accountable. However, I will not be committing to any deal yet, as I want to assess the situation after each election. For instance, I wouldn't give C&S to the SDP if they had heaps less seats than the coalition and vice versa.


[06-Apr-20 07:52 PM] showstealer1829#6775
I always keep my options open when it comes to supply and confidence, you do your electorate a misservice if you don't. I worked with the Liberals in my first term and the SDP in my second term, so I'm always open to speak with anyone. Both the major parties have their strengths and weaknesses, I have some ideas on what I would do if the option came up but as always as an Independent it's best to keep your options open. I will make that decision in talking to the leaders in the Nicholls community, just as I have the past two times.


[06-Apr-20 07:54 PM] Youmaton#1190

I thank Sally for her question. I, like everyone else on this stage, is committed to environmental protection and climate change action. I have announced revegetation programs for Brisbane's forests and clean-up programs for its waterways too. I would like to also see stronger environmental laws nation wide.
Climate change is in my opinion the most urgent problem we face, and I continue to support renewables development and new technologies that will reduce emissions faster. It is of the utmost importance.
I don't believe the Greens are the most environmental party here. Having Greens as your name doesn't magically create responsible climate and environmental policies.

[06-Apr-20 07:59 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
On the Environmental issues, I can firmly take a stand on this as I have done multiple times before. 

I come from a place called Fiji, a small island republic in the Pacific. Right now, we are facing a crisis where our islands are sinking and our economic resources are being deprived due to Climate Change. I am seeing the livelihoods of many of my own family be swallowed slowly by the sea or be destroyed by the forces of nature which are only being exemplified by the change in our Climate.

Riley and the National Party have consistently stood against the Environment in that regard. They claim it isn't man-made despite what all the scientists keep trying to hammer home. I must say that they are willing to take no responsibility at all for the lives of human beings worldwide and for the actions they help continue. We need urgent action to work against coal interests and against our destructive practises which have alienated the Pacific. 

The crisis's our country faces, whether they are bushfires or other environmental concerns which destroys lives, are propagated by Climate Change. The interests of coal tycoons are overriding the interests of human beings worldwide. I am proud to stand up on this stage as the man with the most personal knowledge of it's effects and I am proud to say that I will take action to fix this crisis and unite as Australians and the world to solve this issue for our future generations and for ourselves now!


[06-Apr-20 07:59 PM] showstealer1829#6775
That's a very good question, as for my own policies, we need a commission to find practical solutions to the problems plauging the Murray-Darling Basin. Both environmentally and for our farmers. People are sick and tired of the same commissions into the same problems. Like in the last term the Nationals passed a motion for a commission into the Murray-Darling Commission. We KNOW already what the problem is with the Murray-Darling Commission, it was basically an excuse to rort the enviroment, rort the river and rort farmers,. We need solutions! Not more of the same cliches and the same investigations going over the same ground that we know already. This is the most important thing the people of Nicholls need, without the river, communities will die and they're sick of the talk, stop investigating the past and work together on solutions for the future, that's what we need


[06-Apr-20 08:01 PM] NGSpy#8096
I'd first like to thank Sally for the question. The environment and the issue of climate change is extremely important to the Social Democratic Party, unlike it seems to be to the National Party, who only ignore it due to the nature of being a corporate suck-up. The Social Democratic Party fully believes in proper action against climate change, as evidenced by the policies we have released in government, and the policies we have released in the manifesto. We have dedicated thirty billion dollars of the budget to new renewable energy, instead of relying on non-renewable, not environmentally-friendly energy that the Nationals advocate fully for.

The Social Democratic Party have detailed in the manifesto that we will:
- Create a new environmental commission.
- Not accept any more requests to gain non-renewable resources
- Continue our dedication to the Paris Agreement and
- Continue the transition to 100% renewables by 2035.


[06-Apr-20 08:01 PM] NGSpy#8096

The Member for Cowper has just stated that he won't sacrifice people's livelihoods for a fantasy idea. Ignoring the fact that nearly every single climate scientists with far more qualifications to talk about the subject than the career politician from Cowper all agree it is caused by man, I hope he recognizes how blissfully ignorant they are being right now.

Yeah mate, people's livelihoods are currently at risk. They're at risk because of Climate Change and because of our environmental change. The environmental conditions in this country are getting worse and worse and we are currently seeing an increase worldwide in natural disasters with many of them being traced to Climate Change. I just spoke at length about how I've seen with my own eyes my own family losing their islands to the encroaching tides or the hurricanes which blast Fiji every single year. I've had relatives go completely broke over hurricanes tied to Climate Change. I've seen the people on the ground and to hear you dismiss these claims as bogus from your high and mighty party rooms in Canberra is a complete disgrace.

I know for a man who is hoping to be the MP for Sydney, you have to have some element of decorum. But that genuinely makes me mad and it's fucking idiotic to ignore what's happening to these people.

Infrastructure would be improved under the Social Democratic Party to make it greener and better for all. One of our major highlights in the manifesto is investments into a high speed rail that would run from Adelaide to Melbourne and then ending up in Sydney. It will be based on the shinkansen in Japan and shall improve efficiency in travel between those areas and to minimise plane travel.

It sounds like a cliche, but public transport is my big interest. Ensuring that all of our suburbs have adequate and equitable transport options is very important, and it also helps us in our climate change fight. 
My other big interest for Brisbane, and Moncrieff too, is connecting up our cities. We can do this by providing fast rail that will effectively transport our workers to and from each city, and hopefully reduce our freeway traffic. It also opens up avenues for flexible working, as well as multiple CBDs.

I have said time and time again in Nicholls we need to improve the rail system, especially in rural areas. The Swan Hill line is in desperate need of upgrading so the passenger corridor can open once again to Mildura. We also need to rebuild and upgrade many of the train lines in East Gippsland that were effected by the bushfires. These are key things to stop congestion on our roads. We also need to provide roads though for those that can't that's we I am pushing for a duplication of the South Gippsland Highway between Cranbourne and Korumburra. We need to make sure that traffic can flow smoothly in one of the fastest growing corridors in the country.

[06-Apr-20 08:29 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
On the topic of Infrastructure, I have long been someone who believes firmly in the importance of infrastructural funding. Currently in Australia, we have households who don't have access to clean drinking water and we have households who are currently facing a major lack of the essentials to live and work in a modern society.

I've long placed the upmost importance in Infrastructure spending and we need to have a system where our urban areas can grow at a good rate and that every community in this country is served. I think that infrastructure should be something which can increase accessibility and make our economy more productive and should be one of our main expenditures in a budget.

While investment into rail is something I 100% support and I completely support the proposal by the Social Democratic Party surrounding their high speed rail projects, I do think we need to concern ourselves with every facet of Infrastructure.

As MP, I will work to make a bill to ensure that every household in Australia has access to clean drinking water and that every household has access to the basics. I will further work to ensure that Australian rail is modern and invested in constantly and consistently so that our economy can flourish and our productivity can flourish. That is my pledge as MP and that productivity will bring in millions of economic stimulus back in return for everything we invest into it.

The SDP had all the time in the world to improve infrastructure, however in the current budget, unlike the PC budget, we haven‚Äôt seen any commitments to crucial infrastructure projects in terms of roads, railways, energy or airways. The SDP have thrown how they‚Äôre supportive of green energy, but where‚Äôs the plants? Where‚Äôs the beef? The Nationals have committed to clean renewable solar power in the Northern Territory and South Australia because we can harness the natural world which we have an abundance of. We also have 40% of the worlds uranium deposits which is why we‚Äôre pushing for nuclear power; another form of clean energy that doesn‚Äôt produce carbon emissions. And we also have an abundance of coal, oil and gas deposits which is why we‚Äôre committed to supporting local Queenslanders with the Carmichael coal mine, the Hunter regions with a coal fired power station and WA and Victoria with potential fracking projects because energy is so expensive and jobs are in demand.

And I would be happy to sit down with the independents and work out what commitments they would want from a Coalition Government in terms of infrastructure.


[06-Apr-20 08:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Showstealer has touted some excellent ideas for infrastructure in the rural parts of Victoria which I would be proud to get behind and will be willing to work with him to back these projects and fund them sufficiently.


[06-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Whilst we‚Äôre on the topic of sufficient funding, it was the Nationals who proposed and passed the Fibre To The Premises bill which will give all Australians access to 21st century internet connection. That can cost anywhere up to $50 billion but the SDP won‚Äôt fully fund it; they‚Äôre butchering it with a tenth of the cost.


[06-Apr-20 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
In terms of agriculture, we haven‚Äôt built a sufficient dam since the 80‚Äôs. The Coalition is committed to a modern day Bradfield Scheme and further investigations into how we can improve the Murray Darling Basin; an inquiry proposed by the Nationals.

Moving to another question. Many Australians have accused politicians of not caring for their electorate, and only looking out for themselves and power. What have you done personally this term to help your electorate, and what do you plan to do if elected as your local MP this week?

‚ÄúModelling indicates that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of 50 parts per million over the last 50 years increased yield potential by 2‚Äì8%. The 0.8¬∞C increase in average temperature over the period benefited wheat crops during the winter months and accelerated maturity. These changes have worked to offset some of the harmful effects of more hot days during grain filling.‚Äù

I have run a truly independent and local campaign, much like the successful one I ran in Moncrieff. This term I have supported commonsense legislation and motions that put the people of Moncrieff ahead in life, as well as all Australians. But just because I have voted the same with SDP many times, doesn't mean I will always. For instance, I voted down their bill lowering the voting age becuase of its silliness. I have voted for the people of Moncrieff, and I hope the people of Brisbane can understand I will do the same.


[06-Apr-20 08:43 PM] Youmaton#1190
Thank you Zak for responding to the question at hand, I ask others do the same


[06-Apr-20 08:43 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Well, Yala, I've done a lot for our electorate and I'm glad that I'm seemingly the only one besides showstealer and Zak actually sticking to the question here. 

I've done the hard yards around my electorate, speaking to leaders views and to the views of the people of Sydney. I have gone down to the grassroots level and spoken and held myself completely accountable to the Sydney population and the people of Sydney. I've got a record where I've lived and worked in Sydney for most of my adult life and I'm glad to say that is true.

I'm a politician who does care about Sydney and a politician who is putting Sydney first above everything else. I'm worried the current Member of Parliament for Sydney is too comprimised by the backroom dealings of his caucus room to put Sydney's priorities first. I'm a man who has delivered on the issues I promised I would deliver on and I trust that the people of Sydney recognize that.


[06-Apr-20 08:44 PM] showstealer1829#6775
In terms of what I have done for my own electorate, I passed the motion to acknowledge the Rural GP Shortage, but the work there is not done, we must get the commission agreed to in that motion up and running during this term and if I'm reelected I'll be doing exactly that

We also worked with the government to ensure the high speed rail passed through our electorate, many places in rural Victoria will now become tourist destinations because the high speed rail will stop there, but we must continue to upgrade our rail network as I said earlier, especially around Swan Hill and East Gippsland. We need to help our farmers and ensure the Murray-Darling gets genuine solutions, not just rehashing the same old things. We need to make sure our farmers and workers in Rural areas are protected throughout this pandemic and I'll be fighting to ensure every job is protected.


[06-Apr-20 08:44 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's endemic of the National Party right now that the Member for Cowper is talking about a question from the start of this debate and getting into a squabble with the SDP rather than talking about his electorate or why his own people can trust him

I have served as Senator for Tasmania, I'll admit, I have had a more nation-wide focus. The job of the senate is to review, and I believe I have done that to the best of my ability. I hope to bring a more Tasmanian focus to parliament next term. I have had a large say in SDP policy, and I plan to implement new Australian Environment Act that commits the Government to end deforestation of old-growth forests and critical habitat for endangered animals, to end extinction and to protect our vital waterways and catchments. Tasmania is famous for it's beautiful landscape, and I wish to protect this. 
Tasmania needs a National Environment Commission that can be an independent voice for the environment and lead a national approach to planning for the future.

I just want to quickly thank Moncrieff for allowing me to be their representative this term, and hope that they may find a good representative to take them further. I hope that Brisbane is able to find trust in my words and of my previous actions. I have tried my hardest to represent my previous electorate, and I ask that they consider having an independent voice to keep the major parties in check. My committments this term are to work towards environmental sustianbility, protect our workers and small businesses through this crisis and beyond, to remove big corporations from influencing our politics, and to just in general work for a better Australia. Thank you for those that have supported me so far.

For two terms now it has been my honor and my privilege to respresent the people of Nicholls. In that time we've gotten a lot done for our community. The Mildura Base Hospital has gotten much needed upgrades, our farmers are getting the recognition they need, we've shone a light on the GP shortage plaguing not only Nicholls but all of rural Australia. We've gotten much need upgrades to rail. But the job is not yet done, we still have the path to travel in upgrading rail, ensuring our rural communities thrive. making things right for all the people of Nicholls. For two terms you have trusted me as your member of parliament and now I ask you to trust me again. Together we will continue to make sure out voices are heard on the national stage. Together we will build a bright future for the people of Nicholls and together we will continue to shock the world.

Sydney has got a choice this election. A man who has barely bothered to show up to any debates or panel shows and has consistently put his party first rather than put his electorate first or a man who is born and ingrained in the working class of the city who understands your issues.

I have gone to your streets and your communities to lobby for the change and policies I know Sydney deserves and policies which will drive us forward. These are scary and uncertain times and are we really willing to take the gamble of the current Member of Parliament who is compromised by his caucus and his policy platforms to oppose policies which could decide whether you can have a job or not or should you have someone representing Sydney First. 

I have promised I will deliver to your needed infrastructural spending and ensure that you all have access to the essentials. I have promised to leave no one behind as we struggle and fight against Covid-19 and I've promised to prioritize protecting our jobs and our businesses from collapse. I've promised to bring in new economic reform and hope for our city and to educate our future generation in good Australian values. I have promised to help in every aspect of life I cans ee as wrong in Sydney and I would be truly honored if you went to the booth and gave your vote to Gregor_The_Beggar for a new and brighter Sydney. Forwards to the Future!

I want to thank the Australian Public for electing an SDP led Government, and for electing me as a senator. This term we have seen a hugely successful, active government, passing 15 bills,  and delivering on a majority of our promises, creating a better Australia for all. The Social Democratic Party, unlike the National Party actually fights for the people of Australia and does not suck up to corporations who actively harm our planets and also you the Australian people. I shall encourage all Australians to properly research their candidates to determine if they are right for them. I shall also encourage all people, that being said, to vote for the Social Democratic Party because we care for you the people of Australia and do not actively advocate for policies against the Australian people and do not act in a way against the Australian people. With that being said, I thank you all for following the campaign and encourage you to vote for the SDP.

This election is a crucial choice, 

You have two choices. A choice between real action and real policy: jobs, growth and investment with the Nationals. More cash in your pocket. A roof over your head. Security for you family. Or you can vote for radical policies; throwing money at whatever in the hopes of it succeeding without measured facts. Take a look at the budget, it was announced extremely early and as a result, revenues are extremely lower than announced and is made up of false radical estimations. We have a crisis on our hands and it was the Nationals who stood up and proposed policy as the SDP waited for the situation to get worse. Since the last election the Coalition has stood up and proposed a united team to form government and fight the radical socialist policies of the SDP, we‚Äôre here to give all Australians a Fair Go, especially when I lick my chops and announce the words ‚ÄòTax Cuts‚Äô. So remember that if you want a team who truly Delivers for Australia, vote for the Coalition!

Welcome to Australia Tonight's flashback stream of the December 2018 election!


[12-May-20 07:36 PM] Youmaton#1190
The UDP/Lib/Reason/CA government had a strong beginning, with the Left Coalition opposition collapsing soon after the September 2018 election. Prime Minister BloodyChrome had led a series of reforms, most famously the decriminalisation of a wide variety of drugs, however this luck would not last. By the end of the term, the opposition had somewhat stabalised, and after a byelection defeat followed by the Prime Minister being 94a'd in a heated question time there was some question as to what might happen in the coming election. When the election was called, it was predicted by every media organisation except for Socialist party owned Direct Action called the election for the incumbent government. Even after it was found out that the Prime Minister had failed to register to vote, it was still expected that there would be enough of a landslide in order to defeat the new Left Coalition opposition.

At this point, thing were beginning to look worrying for the government, however with 9 seats remaining it was still possible that they could pull off a victory over the Left Coalition.


[12-May-20 08:20 PM] Youmaton#1190
Greenway came next, as the UDP hoped that the seat's status as a safe seat would ensure they could catch up to the Left Coalition.

Kingston proved a different story to the rest of the nation, as both coalitions failed to find agreement on candidates leading to a heavily contested field. Whilst Matt Monti had launched an early campaign to win over South Australia, it became clear that the race would fall between DirtySaiyan of the UDP and future Prime Minister Drunk_King_Robert. The election pendulum showed a lean towards the UDP, favouring the government's chances of reelection.

The seat of Whitlam shocked the nation with the defeat of the opposition leader at the previous election, and it was sure to repeat the same this time around. This seat would decide the fate of the parliament, as each coalition fell one short prior to this seat being announced. As it was called, cheers rung out from the Melbourne Trades Hall.

With this victory, the Left Coalition had pulled off the impossible and won in the House of Represenatives. Following the election, a deal was struck between the Left Coalition and Centre Alliance in a confidence and supply agreement, as the new PM Youmaton and DPM Drunk_King_Robert faced the prospect of the first left wing government since the fall of Bsharri.

[01-Jul-20 05:33 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Hello Australia!


[01-Jul-20 05:33 PM] Youmaton#1190
To begin, lets start things simple. Why do you want to serve Robertson, and what is the first thing you will do if elected?


[01-Jul-20 05:34 PM] Ascari#4541
Shall I start?


[01-Jul-20 05:34 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Go ahead.


[01-Jul-20 05:40 PM] Ascari#4541
Robertson, the fact of the matter is is that when you compare mine and Jayden's records, you only see net benefits for Robertson when you look at the last three months. Over the last three months I have advocated for $5.45 billion worth of investment in infrastructure which Robertsonians use, while some they may not every day, it broadens the road supply which means that Robertson's roads can cope with congestion, and congestion has reduced and ETAs to destinations have also reduced. As Member for Robertson I have also served to advocate for the slashing of the Luxury Car Tax Rate by 5% and we'll decrease it by 8% more, we've cut revenue by cutting taxation. I've advocated for giving Robertsons more of what they earn and I've advocated for a greater arrangement in line with a Social Investment Scheme to make it so that Australians get out more of what they put in. Jayden, on the other hand advocated for a referendum that cost $150 million, landed this Liberal National Party with the responsibility of carrying it out because he *knows* that he can't do it himself. At every turn when we tried to cut taxes, Jayden's Democrats shut down Income Tax relief saying it "decreases revenue" - well there's no surprises there pal, that's what happens, you have to decrease unnecessary expenditure, but he couldn't name the first five things that Australia has done with it's money in the last 10 years. 

What I will do for Robertson? I will continue to provide Tax Relief, I will cut the Car Tax rate by a further 8%, I will scrap Electricity from GST, I will cut your Income Tax bills, and at the end of it all, you, the average Robertsonian, will have hundreds to thousands more dollars in your bank account by year's end, you'll have seen more Government action than ever before - we're already seeing it through Building Up Australia, and we have a long way to go yet.


[01-Jul-20 05:40 PM] Youmaton#1190
Your response @JAYDEN?


[01-Jul-20 05:42 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Well to respond to Winston, obviously he hasn't been tuning into my campaign, because I have said and time and time again the Australian Democrats did not dislike tax cuts, in fact we were prepared to vote for them, however the LNP refused to negotiate and refused to pass the amendments, and we were forced to vote them down in the Senate.

As for the question, the first thing I'll do if I am elected is introduce a bill to ensure political fairness, transparency and open democracy with Australians. The Australian Democrats believe that it is important for the government to be fair, to be open and to be open to changes. As we are seeing right now, the SDP are in the HCA with my opponent due to their work, or lack there of, behind closed doors. I believe that if the Parliament has nothing to hide, let them in.


[01-Jul-20 05:44 PM] Ascari#4541
No, the fact of the matter is that you opposed income tax cuts in favour of a modification to the Goods and Services Tax because of a dislike in revenue decrease, well, revenue has decreased, and I don't suppose you could quote the exact number of dollars we have spent on increasing defence investment and the Building Up Australia program? He doesn't pay attention to expenditure, he only cares about what we take out of his pocket and what he can embezzle as he did last time, the Social Democrats famously cocked up $40 billion worth of fiscal funds, and Jayden was part of the government propping up that Treasury arrangement.


[01-Jul-20 05:45 PM] Youmaton#1190
@JAYDEN?


[01-Jul-20 05:48 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Winston, we made it very clear, and I know for the fact the SDP were the same, that with the unpredictable nature of our economy through this pandemic, we did not want years of tax cuts. We told you very clearly, many times, the Australian Democrats wanted income tax cuts, just not for the period of time you wanted. Even after that you chose your own fate, you still voted them down knowing that we couldn't pass them without it. The reason? Well it's clear, you have wanted a double dissolution from the moment the government walked in the door! 

Also may I add, as someone who is currently in the High Court for defamation right now, it is quite a bold statement to say that I want to embezzle money.


[01-Jul-20 05:51 PM] Ascari#4541
I find it funny, how after we trawl through all of your tripe, you actually failed to point out the degree of expenditure we've achieved in this term. By reading the Budget Papers, we're spending $29,179,500,000 on Building Up Australia, and our Defence and VA Expenditure is now at $36,573,762,000, Jayden doesn't pay attention to the Government accounts. I challenged him to mention this in my previous statement, and just like how he failed Robertson by threatening 18,000 jobs, he's failed the Australian people because he's prepared to go through one half of the Budgets, but he's not prepared to follow through. That sums up Jayden's form of representation - Failing to follow through.


[01-Jul-20 05:53 PM] Ascari#4541
Now, if you also want the delta in the defence expenditure compared to last term, we increased it by >$20 billion. You couldn't write down these numbers if you tried, are you able to count to 10, or do you luck out after 5?


[01-Jul-20 05:55 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Winston if you've tracked any form of my campaigning you'll know that I've been at the Williamstown Air Force base to launch my campaign, I think it is very important to increase our defence spending, and I applaud you for it, never have I said that I oppose that measure, in fact never have I said that I oppose any of those measures that you mentioned. For your information, I have read the budget, some of it I agree with, some of it I do not, I don't know what political attack you're trying to pull when I literally agree with you on raising those portfolios.


[01-Jul-20 05:56 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Defence is a very important industry, I agree with increasing the expenditure


[01-Jul-20 05:56 PM] Ascari#4541
Again, you fail to address any of the statistics here, I'm not voicing any discontent with your plan here but have you even costed the Williamstown Base?


[01-Jul-20 05:58 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Then what point are you trying to make? I felt I made it very clear I agree with those programs and I agree with that spending... Do you want me to tell you that I hate those plans and they're pointless or something?


[01-Jul-20 05:59 PM] Ascari#4541
No, I just want to know if you actually have a plan to fund these things or if you're just going to fail to follow through. I'm only being reasonable here. You need to know and you need to make it so that Australians know that your plans for expenditure have been appropriately measured, but by your deflecting you're clearly insinuating that you haven't bothered to measure it all. That's the difference between your mix of ADP-SDP versus the LNP. You're about feeling good, I'm about doing good.


[01-Jul-20 06:01 PM] Ascari#4541
Answer my question, have you costed the Williamstown Base?


[01-Jul-20 06:01 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Winston, we are the cross bench. It is not our job to make the budget, it is the governments.


[01-Jul-20 06:01 PM] Ascari#4541
So you'll introduce plans but fail to check out if you can fund them in the instance if you can get into Government?


[01-Jul-20 06:01 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Why would I do such a thing when I have never even been in a position near the defence portfolio


[01-Jul-20 06:02 PM] Ascari#4541
I remember when the LNP was in Opposition, as part of our policy group outside Parliament I had a great working set on how much our defence programs costed and we got them sorted to a tee. You haven't done anything because you're lazy.

On to a different matter now, the aussieconservative budget reintroduced funding for coal fired power plants within Australia. What are your thoughts on this action, and if elected would you support the abolition of such?


[01-Jul-20 06:02 PM] Ascari#4541
It doesn't matter if the neighbour across the road is building a house mate, you can still go to the hardware store and find out how much a brick costs.


[01-Jul-20 06:02 PM] Ascari#4541
I'll let Jayden go first on this one


[01-Jul-20 06:10 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Well firstly, as I already covered in my campaign with the local P&C last week, I do not support the coal fired power plant. Now Winston tries to make this fear mongering campaign that I am killing off peoples jobs in "my grand plan", which may I add was formulated by the wonderful Youmaton, but what we're seeing is the coal industry slowly dying off and I would rather see my constituency have the ability to receive government funding to help them retrain into a new career. The retrain or retire program is helping the people in the coal industry, it gives them comfort knowing there is a safety net if they need it to change. Now obviously, I'm not saying that this will be done overnight, this is a long term plan, with a long term solution. The coal industry is slowly dying, and we need safety nets to help our fossil fuel industries.

It's interesting to me that if I started investing into renewables quicker, I would be leaving the fossil fuel workers behind, but when I don't leave them behind and try and help them, I'm killing their jobs!

Back to the question on the plant, I think the plan is stupid. I think we need to invest in renewables. We already have so many coal fired power plants in Australia, a new one is just going to add more carbon emissions. We should be investing in renewable energy in the hunter, I know there is plenty of land that could have renewable energy farms, I've seen it myself. As time goes on we will need to start investing in renewables so why are we wasting time?

As we've seen this term, Cabinet member My13InchDuck introduced the ban on new coal fired power plants, and I support that, we need to stop investing further in fossil fuels and start investing in renewables.


[01-Jul-20 06:16 PM] Ascari#4541
I'll just address what Jayden said about this "grand plan", I don't know what he's talking about, I've never endeavoured into such conspiracy theories. What he is probably doing however is mocking the plight of 18,000 citizens of Robertson who, under Retrain or Retire, an initiative that Mr. Jayden Williamson voted for, I have the voting sheet right here bud, would be forced out of their job. The Liberal Nationals scrapped it because we don't believe in arbitrary reductions in our employment figures and we don't believe in destroying lives. We have spent, in a scheme I supported, $1.2 billion in the Hunter region on the new Plant and it will reinvigorate the local job market with hundreds of jobs which will support so many new families, and will lower the prices of electricity throughout the region. Frankly, I believe in making it easier for families to live, I believe in giving people more of what they earn, I believe in letting them have a job, and I believe in the three basic liberal tenets that Government should guarantee the citizenry's access to Life, Liberty, and Happiness. Jayden supported erasing their job prospects and the plan he supported only put $1 billion into supporting newly retired Coal Miners, which is a joke, in New Zealand their wage subsidy scheme costed nearly $15 billion and the jobs that supported were significantly lower than the jobs that Jayden outlawed. he put less than 6.7% of what New Zealand did to support their jobs during COVID-19 for 2 months, except he expects those pie crumbs to support them throughout their retired life. That's not a fund, that's a misery. I will be supporting this Plant because I believe in accessible electricity and the right for every Australian to get a job, AS THE LNP PROMISED WHEN WE ENTERED GOVERNMENT. Jayden will want to get rid of it because he believes in wasting money, as he doesn't know how to cost schemes, as evidenced by his failure to cost Williamstown Air Base.


[01-Jul-20 06:21 PM] Ascari#4541
In fact, here's something interesting I just learned. He advocated for an Air Base to "support Robertson" that is hundreds of kilometres away, Robertson is based in Sydney, mate, Williamstown is in Victoria.


[01-Jul-20 06:23 PM] JAYDEN#5487
AAF Base Williamtown in located in Newcastle actually, in fact it is one of the only bases that connects with a civilian airport, NEWCASTLE AIRPORT!


[01-Jul-20 06:23 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Quite funny to see your own MP not even know where the airport is!


[01-Jul-20 06:23 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Now if I can go back to my other points


[01-Jul-20 06:23 PM] Ascari#4541
Ah, you're talking about the suburb in Port Stephens, easy mistake, and I'll own it.


[01-Jul-20 06:23 PM] Ascari#4541
What isn't being owned, however, is your failure to cost such a Base.


[01-Jul-20 06:24 PM] JAYDEN#5487
No, it is located in Newcastle not Port Stevens


[01-Jul-20 06:25 PM] Ascari#4541
I'll quote a map here: "Williamtown is a rural suburb of the Port Stephens local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia."


[01-Jul-20 06:25 PM] JAYDEN#5487
And I would still like to ask you, why would I cost such a thing? That's not my portfolio, I have faith that the Defence and Treasury Departments can do such a thing


[01-Jul-20 06:25 PM] Ascari#4541
"It is located on the main road between Newcastle and Nelson Bay."


[01-Jul-20 06:25 PM] Ascari#4541
You don't know where it is either!


[01-Jul-20 06:25 PM] Ascari#4541
I have the decency to make sure the facts are right, own up to the mistake, and correct the record - you don't have that! You don't have guts!


[01-Jul-20 06:26 PM] JAYDEN#5487
If you are talking about the LGA, then yes you are correct it is Port Stevens


[01-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Ascari#4541
> And I would still like to ask you, why would I cost such a thing? That's not my portfolio, I have faith that the Defence and Treasury Departments can do such a thing
@JAYDEN So you have zero funding plan?


[01-Jul-20 06:26 PM] JAYDEN#5487
It was a miscommunication on my part


[01-Jul-20 06:26 PM] Ascari#4541
He has no plan to fund the Air Base, he has no plan to finance it, no plan to employ, and he is a total brick when it comes to communicating locations and owning up to mistakes. We have the definition of the sad man that sits before me, Robertson.


[01-Jul-20 06:27 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Did I not literally just say it was a miscommunication on my part?


[01-Jul-20 06:27 PM] JAYDEN#5487
And if you want to know how I'll fund the AAF base, in the budget!


[01-Jul-20 06:27 PM] Ascari#4541
It wasn't just a miscommunication, it was a joke, and it was an intentional one at that to mislead our residents and frankly you owe Robertson an apology


[01-Jul-20 06:27 PM] Ascari#4541
> And if you want to know how I'll fund the AAF base, in the budget!
@JAYDEN What budget? You haven't presented any plan outlining how you'll fund it through a Budget!


[01-Jul-20 06:28 PM] JAYDEN#5487
At the next election will I be the government? Most likely not! It is the treasury department to write a budget not a crossbench MP


[01-Jul-20 06:29 PM] Ascari#4541
Let's also diverge into his misrepresentation of the suburb - it's not Williamstown, that's how he mislead us and my team which sent me the location, he bungled the name - it's Williamtown! The error caused was because he can't pronounce suburb names correctly!

[01-Jul-20 06:39 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yes thanks Yala, as we've seen, Winston likes to yell, call people names, and create a 15 minute argument over where a suburb is and how to pronounce a name. He's carried on about how uneducated I am, but may I remind him, who's the one with a PhD? Robertson, these traits are all something associated with a 2 year old. He doesn't know how to control his anger, I came on this program ready to talk about the proper issues such as what I would change in Robertson, and what the people want, but instead it turned into a competition on who can pronounce words the best! He has called me a plethora of names tonight Australia, you've seen it here first.

So on Saturday, you can either vote for someone with the maturity of a child, someone who, when confronted likes to defecate on someone's desk on National TV, or you can vote for a man who is committed to change, who is committed to being your voice, who is committed to representing you.

If elected, I will continue to work with local groups on education, mental health and the environment, the issues you have flagged to me as being your most concerned areas. Everyone, it is time for a new voice, and independent voice, the Australian Democrats voice.

Thank you Winston for debating against me, thank you Yala for chairing the debate and thank you Australia for tuning in. That's all I really have to say Yala.

Hello, and welcome to Australia Tonight. A historical political event has rocked the political arena, as the Liberal National Party voted to remove the Leader of the Opposition from his position in an act the former LotO describes as a "vicious coup". Tonight, we speak directly with the man himself, as the vote that has changed the opposition reveals further details.

It‚Äôs good to see that I am no longer burdened by sheer laziness


[29-Jul-20 09:36 PM] Youmaton#1190
I think to start off with, many Australians will just want to know what happened. Did you know that this was coming? Why do you think this has occurred?


[29-Jul-20 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh I absolutely knew this was coming, a convention was called for last Wednesday and the Party President was too occupied with, I don‚Äôt really know what, let‚Äôs assume getting on the beers. Winston then informed me I was going to be spilled and I was completely fine. For too long this has been a one man show with me having to do the work, I‚Äôm relieved that I no longer have to carry the dead weights of the Liberal National Party


[29-Jul-20 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, why did this happen you ask?


[29-Jul-20 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I‚Äôm not quite too sure considering some of the hardest working men I‚Äôve seen in my life completely dropped off of the face of the earth.


[29-Jul-20 09:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Riley was too lazy to continue on with being a whip so I did the job, yet barely any followed my instructions, I mean being honest here it was surprising to see even a man like Stranger debate more frequently than My13InchDuck.

[29-Jul-20 09:47 PM] Youmaton#1190
A question has been raised to our network by a parliamentarian. With the government in a stronger position within the parliament with the election of Matt Monti in Mayo, and a majority in the House guaranteed for the controversial clean energy legislation due to the vocal support of My13InchDuck, what do you think lies ahead within the political arena, and do you have any confidence in any new LNP leadership to effectively oppose the NGSpy government?

I was always at the forefront of opposing NGSpy, it‚Äôs actually on the records that My13InchDuck was proud to encourage the SDP in voncing the LNP government during our leadership debate after Riley voluntarily resigned upon my consultation

It has always been my hard work that has kept this party chugging along, they wanted to get rid of me from leadership, so I‚Äôve ridded myself entirely.

I too was concerned about the direction he was going to take the party, in regards to policy and it was often he who rammed policy speedily down the throats of Cabinet Ministers. I recognise his abilities in his authoritarian manner and so I bumped him from the Attorney General‚Äôs position, where ramifications for the law could be made, to Home Affairs where he could unleash as much authority as he wants to let it out rather than direct it to policy.

Now onto Winston, I like him and the ways he operates. Indeed he has confided into me many a time that he backs whoever gets him the best positions and often approached me in private to ask the positions which he would get if he supported me in the contest between myself and Duck.

Now, as the Treasurer, I continuously asked the Cabinet for the policies to put into the budget. The only person who ever got back to me was BloodyChrome


[29-Jul-20 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Each and every single policy, apart from the hospital upgrades, was written and funded by myself and in return for singlehandedly delivering a budget, I have been deposed by a group powerful in the party room and purely hopeless when it comes to anything else.


[29-Jul-20 10:09 PM] Youmaton#1190
Was there consideration to continue on in the LNP as a frontbench or backbench member to influence leadership and policy there, or did you find the situation untenable?

Riley would often voice his concerns with me, whether it be accusing PineappleCrusher of leaking cabinet chats to 9 News and organising a sting operation within the the party with me, or whether it was voicing his concerns about BloodyChromes lack of action as Health Minister

Having this occur, it was easy for me to relax and write up our policies without having to worry

But then of course, Duck started making noise in the party room and we nutted out our plan of action ‚Äî he was to complete his term and I was to swiftly succeed him.


[29-Jul-20 10:24 PM] Youmaton#1190
Within your letter, you claim that former Prime Minister PineappleCrusher_ is a "effective factional warlord", alongside claims that PC is in fact the one behind leaks to 9 News and "organising a sting operation". What do you mean by this?


[29-Jul-20 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
PC is an effective factional warlord, he controlled the Liberal faction like a shepherd and the sheep followed his m along. Whoever has PC, has leadership ‚Äî it‚Äôs that simple.

Now onto the sting operation, this is a good one


[29-Jul-20 10:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
In private discussion, we feared that PC was undermining the party to assert his dominance as the National faction grew and slightly overpowered him


[29-Jul-20 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
How so? Well there were leaks to 9 news so many accused him of being a leak. Obviously, this turned out not to be the case but we needed to know


[29-Jul-20 10:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
So we contacted the AEC and established four new offices in the party headquarters and only certain members could access each so that no member was in more than one room


[29-Jul-20 10:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
The AEC would publish us fake polls and Riley and I would pretend to talk with the AEC and potentially cause for members to be concerned and approach the press

Leader of the Opposition Matthias Caesar has just annouced on twitter that he has been in contact with the President, it is unclear at this stage what the content of the conversation entailed but it is most likely not for a cup of tea.

[30-Aug-21 08:29 PM] Youmaton#1190
Tonight we are relaunching the station with a debate to change the nation, one that will decide who will become Leader of the Opposition.


[30-Aug-21 08:30 PM] Youmaton#1190
With the Liberal party now leaderless, the opposition is looking for a new leader to take them towards the October election.

Hello everyone!


[30-Aug-21 08:32 PM] Youmaton#1190
To begin with, the Liberal Party has seen mixed success lately, with 2nd place in the polls and a close runner-up finish in Sydney. What is your plan for leader if elected? @12MaxWild @ripauntmay


[30-Aug-21 08:34 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
I will reinvigorate the party, with an ambitious policy platform. While Riley will keep us bogged down with lunatics by associating with antivaxxers, I will actually materially improve the party.

[30-Aug-21 08:38 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Thank you, Yala.

The Liberal Party has an uphill battle, but it is a battle that I am willing to take. What I want for the Liberal Party is to hand the power back into the hands of the membership because, as of now, we have top down leadership, where the leader runs the operation without any form of consultation, which must change. We need to make sure that every member gets a say on the policy we take to the next election, rather than having the leadership dictate the policy of the party. I will channel the liberal democratic values that this nation was founded on and put the liberal back into this party.


[30-Aug-21 08:38 PM] Youmaton#1190
Strong words there from Max, though questionable for any sense of party unity. Will you both pledge to support the other candidate as Leader if they win?


[30-Aug-21 08:39 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
I am confident in my party's ability to elect someone who wants to actually do something that would benefit a majority of Australians and not someone who belueves in Ivermectin over the actual bloody vaccines! And as such, I do not believe Riley be elected leader.


[30-Aug-21 08:39 PM] Youmaton#1190
Will you leave the Liberal Party if Riley becomes leader? @12MaxWild


[30-Aug-21 08:40 PM] ripauntmay#0083
It is disgusting to see such slander coming from my opponent. Free choice is not anti-vax‚Ä¶ It is clear that Max wants to take this party down a path of radicalised authoritarianism, and this is something I will not stand for. Furthermore, he cannot manage money, especially after his outrageous spending proposal in the high speed rail bill.


[30-Aug-21 08:43 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Oh for god's sake. I'm an authoritarian? Really? I think the president needs to get his facts straight. While my High Speed Rail bill will soon be amended, you cannot amend Riley's pathetic policy platform without removing him entirely.


[30-Aug-21 08:43 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Riley thinks his parents telling him to wash his hands is radical socialist authoritarianism.

Shame on me for acknowledging that most Australians think denying the effectiveness of a vaccine?


[30-Aug-21 08:46 PM] Youmaton#1190
There is great debate over what step the government should take around the coronavirus crisis. From lockdown protests, to vaccine passports, to delta, to a new varient that has been discovered in South Africa, how would you deal with the health crisis if you were leading the government? What policies would you keep from the government, and which ones would you change?


[30-Aug-21 08:46 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Max has no substance, he has no experience, and he will continue down his path of back room deals. I will bring a new era to the liberal party, an era where there is consultation on preference deals and other major party decisions. Now is the time to put an end to corrupt  back room deals, and only I will deliver this!


[30-Aug-21 08:47 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Just to note, the reference to members choosing policy was in relation to max‚Äôs comments, that my policy platform was pathetic.


[30-Aug-21 08:48 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Dragging the Liberal Party into the past, restoring a reggressive, backwards and quite frankly silly policy platform is not what I would call a new era for our party. I would like to note that Riley has been planning to spill our great former leader RH for quite a while and he is the one who does corrupt back room deals. I believe that the only way forward for our party and our nation is for the Liberal Party to vote me in.


[30-Aug-21 08:50 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We need to set a freedom date, and follow in the footsteps of the United kingdom and the rest of the world. If elected leader, I will work with the party in order to reach an agreed upon vaccination target, so that we can finally open up, when we reach that target. Only I offer this path out of lockdowns and chaos, no more lockdowns and no vaccine passports.


[30-Aug-21 08:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
@12MaxWild What would you do?


[30-Aug-21 08:52 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
The United Kingdom's "freedom day" was an unmitigated disaster. Their covid cases soared and thousands of people died just because Boris Johnson wanted to gain in the polls. I agree with my opponent that lockdowns have been economically damaging but I think that he's just looked at surface level and forgets that exiting lockdown early will only lead to more lockdowns. As leader I would push to increase our vaccination rate and provide tax relief to businesses that have been hit hard.


[30-Aug-21 08:54 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Riley's "freedom" day will give more people the "freedom" to die from a debilitating disease.


[30-Aug-21 08:54 PM] ripauntmay#0083
That is a straight up lie; in fact, Max came to me asking about what we should do about RussianHacker after Russianhacker condemned him for comments made in question time. We need transparency and truth, not spin and lies.


[30-Aug-21 08:54 PM] Youmaton#1190
Do you have evidence of that claim? @ripauntmay


[30-Aug-21 08:55 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
No, he doesn't, but I have evidence of him immediately seeking power after I told him about RH's resignation.


[30-Aug-21 08:56 PM] Youmaton#1190
Only evidence will validate these claims


[30-Aug-21 08:56 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I do have evidence, and can disclose it here

@ripauntmay A chance to respond before we go to the next question


[30-Aug-21 09:05 PM] ripauntmay#0083
What is this in reference to, the fact that Max said, that I plan on spilling RussianHacker, or the statement that he was referring to the party. This evidence is not very clear, and does not necessarily prove his point.


[30-Aug-21 09:06 PM] Youmaton#1190
New South Wales has witnessed another wave of protests today, as residents took to their watercraft to condemn the government's desalination projects. What are your thoughts on these recent events, and what would you do more broadly to deal with the drought?


[30-Aug-21 09:08 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Again, I have my personal stances on this issue, but it is an issue that affects the membership. As leader, I will consult the party to get a general consensus on their position and then act on that decision. This is the only way forward regarding this issue.


[30-Aug-21 09:09 PM] Youmaton#1190
What are your personal stances? Australia should know if you believe they should support you.


[30-Aug-21 09:10 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I have stated that I support our farmers in relation to this issue; however, again, the ultimate end of day decision on this is made by the party, not myself.


[30-Aug-21 09:10 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
It is clear that the government will do moral gymnastics to justify their position. The Green Party which bases its whole policy platform on environmentalism is in support of a scheme which murders marine life. The Country Labor Party clearly just cares about farmers rather than everyone. However, Riley fails to see the nuance in this situation. While desalination fundamentally is a good idea and the CLP's disastrous implementation of the policy doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad idea.

Yes, we both are.


[30-Aug-21 09:13 PM] ripauntmay#0083

@12MaxWild @ripauntmay Your response?


[30-Aug-21 09:17 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
I'll just come out and say it. I didn't think RH took the right path with his condemnation, considering it was purely so we could work with the SDP (which he has affirmed multiple times). I find it interesting that he has been campaigning for my side over Riley, which truly says how poor his leadership


[30-Aug-21 09:18 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This is just another example of why Max shouldn‚Äôt lead the party. His decisions are not clear or coordinated; they are based on rage filled anger. We need to have clear, calm, collectedness leading the party to the next election, and that is what I am the embodiment of. At no stage will I threaten or attempt to undermine members within my party because that is not how I operate.


[30-Aug-21 09:20 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We need a leader that can set an example for the members and Australians. A leader that can guide this party and nation through tough decisions. That is what I offer, along with experience, as a former prime minister and leader of the National/Liberal/Liberal National Parties.


[30-Aug-21 09:21 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Riley's statements are completely untrue. He is the one who violated COVID-19 restrictions to attend an antivax protest, showing that his faith is not in science and instead it's in lunatics on youtube.


[30-Aug-21 09:23 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Max is a rabid dog that should not be thrown a bone. He is relentless in his baseless attacks against me, specifically in relation to covid-19. To add further, I have not breached Covid restrictions; QLD is Covid free, and protests are allowed. Now is the time to put an end to the lies spouted by max.


[30-Aug-21 09:23 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
With the faith of the Liberal Party, I will fight for the values of Australians, not flat earthers.

[30-Aug-21 09:36 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Thank you Yala for having me on tonight.
The Liberal Party if they want to prevail at the next election have one clear choice if they want to win the next election: the person with vision, with courage, with a high enough intelligence to acknowledge that vaccines work, someone who has a policy platform that won't take our nation back to the dark ages, someone who other parties and independents would want to do business with and someone who will fight for this nation tooth and claw. On the other hand, the Liberal Party could elect Riley, who is the reason the other parties have the famous "two thirds" line, who wants the Liberals to embody everything that is wrong with our democracy and someone who has no policy of substance. Instead of taking ivermectin, I will take our ambitious policy platform to the Australian people and will win the next election. 

If we ended up in a situation where we became the largest party but needed to secure a coalition, we would need to garner support of other parties. Many party leaders have explicitly said that they would rule out working with Riley. While my rhetoric can be harsh at times, I am at the end of the day a bipartisan politician that has voted for legislation from all parties. I will deliver change to the people of Australia, and that's why I should be humbly elected leader of the Liberal Party of Australia.
Riley wants us to move backwards, I want to take us forwards. We already need to catch up with other parties. 

Under my leadership we will reach for the stars while Riley will be clawing at the dirt, trying to get the bleach to inject into his veins.

Liberals across this nation have a huge decision to make, with the results of this election being known tomorrow. 

I offer a plan for the liberal party, a plan to shakeup the way this party operates, to put an end to the backroom deals and chaotic freak announcements made by certain members through the party vessel without any membership or FEC consultation. 

My plan is to put the power back into the hands of the members as they craft our policy into the future. I will lead from the ground up and ensure that every member gets a say in relation to the policy platform that we take to the next election. 

I will fight for liberal democracy and the values that this nation was founded on, I will fight to secure tax cuts and seek to balance the budget. 

My vision for the Liberal Party will see a new prosperous era, one that is unseen before in the history of this party.

My opponent offers all spin and no substance, dangerous and rabid behaviour. He offers to bring this party to its knees in order to please his ego, but the only thing he will see is an electoral wipeout at the next election. 

Now is not the time for fiscal progressivism, ridiculous spending, and no plan to manage the deficit and debt. 

Now is the time for experienced leadership, a plan that gives the members more power over decisions, rather than having that power designated to a select few of the backroom. The time to bring back this party‚Äôs liberal Democratic values, to put the liberal back into the name. 

The choice this election is clear, elect me so that I can lead this party to a victory at the next election. As of now, 14% of Australia wants me, whilst only 5% want my opponent.
