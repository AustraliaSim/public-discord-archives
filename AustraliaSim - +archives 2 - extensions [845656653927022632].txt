[30-May-21 06:09 PM] mikiboss#2416
like it's it's 8:55 or like 10 minutes before poll fair enough, but if it's accessible, I think it's fine adding in

We‚Äôve had this discussion time and time again, debate extensions have been consistently approved by the AEC as debating is not an essential part of the ‚Äòparliamentary‚Äô process (I.E. has minimal impact on the movement of a bill), whereas debating is necessary for modifiers and allows us to ensure that people are allotted the correct amount of modifiers with transparency and clarity
