The liberal party have been disqualified due to:
1. No response to the survey was completed 
2. No one, not even themselves, voted for them.

In no place, because they were disqualified for not doing the survey, and they got no votes, not even from themselves, is the **liberal Party**

[09-May-21 09:21 PM] Cam T#6441
Next up, on 39 goat points, is the **National Party.**
Their biggest let down was lgbtqi rights. 
Their best result was drug reform.

Their best area was using rehab instead of jail for drugs.

The CLP did suffer a little bit because of Gun Control.


[09-May-21 09:26 PM] Cam T#6441
We know they are representing farmers, who don’t automatic mean shooters.


[09-May-21 09:28 PM] Cam T#6441
The Aus Dems went well, after the good morning goat removed the penalty for the back stabbing of Jayden and ignoring questions from good journalists, their final goat score was 67.


[09-May-21 09:29 PM] Cam T#6441
The next part has a big jump up in the scores


[09-May-21 09:29 PM] Cam T#6441
We are excited to announce in 3rd place, the SDP.

I vote for you, we need you, the election is on fire.
You vote for me, vote for me first preference.
Oh, you vote for me, give me every vote I need.

Get a lifetime of promises, and a world of dreams.
Speak the language of goats and you know what it means. 
Mm. And it can’t be wrong. Take your vote and make it strong, yes. 

The goat party’s the best. Better than all the rest. 
Better than everyone. Any mp u ever met. 
Goats will be in your heart. They r kind with every word they say. 
When the bells ring, they will be snacking on bread. 

The goats r the star of every night and every day
The other parties, have lost, they get washed away. 
Just as long as goats here are elected, they could be in no better place.

The goat party’s the best. Better than the ADP,
Better than the nationals. Any party u ever met.

Goats act from their heart. They are kind with every word they say. 
Oh, They won’t back stab, no no. They would rather eat bread.

Each time you vote they get more government control
They lead with a good heart and soul. 
We vote for goats are we aren’t alone.
It’s time, here we go!

🎶 🎶 🎶 
The goat party’s the best. It’s better than all the rest. 
It’s better than the CLP. Better than any party before.
Goats vote with their heart. We hang on every word they say. 
Oh When the bells ring, you know they will snack on bread.

Oh, the goat party’s the best!

__Calling All MP’s and Senators__
Our country has a bad history of how lgbt+ citizens have been treated and wrongfully convicted of crimes. The Good Morning Goat is calling parliament to share an apology for the harm their laws and attitudes have caused to the community.

🔴 Our next fact shows that the Tasmanian government were jerks, and Australia broke treaties.    
🗓  1994
 Nicholas Toonen complains to the United Nations Human Rights Committee that Australia's remaining anti-sodomy laws and, by extension, differing ages of consent, are a breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. He loses his job after the Tasmanian government says that unless he is fired from the Tasmanian AIDS Council, they will withdraw funding. The Committee finds that Australia is in breach of its treaty obligations.

[05-Sep-21 08:23 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I believe, that if we choose a new capital, it should be one of our great regional towns, such as Sale or Bairnsdale. I love our regions, and they are beautiful towns! Putting government there would help revitalise these towns with #investment. Buy local!


[05-Sep-21 08:24 PM] Cam T#6441

Interesting answer


[05-Sep-21 08:25 PM] Cam T#6441
@haroldinite what do you think


[05-Sep-21 08:25 PM] haroldinite#1013
"Sydney, Sydney (/ˈsɪdni/ (About this soundlisten) SID-nee; Dharug: Gadi;[5][6] Greater Sydney, Dharug: Eora[7]) is the capital city of the state of New South Wales, and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.[8] Located on Australia's east coast, the metropolis surrounds Port Jackson and extends about 70 km (43.5 mi) on its periphery towards the Blue Mountains to the west, Hawkesbury to the north, the Royal National Park to the south and Macarthur to the south-west.[9] Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs, spread across 33 local government areas. Informally there are at least 15 regions. Residents of the city are known as "Sydneysiders".[10] As of June 2020, Sydney's estimated metropolitan population was 5,367,206,[11] meaning the city is home to approximately 66% of the state's population.[12]

Indigenous Australians have inhabited the Sydney area for at least 30,000 years, and thousands of engravings remain throughout the region, making it one of the richest in Australia in terms of Aboriginal archaeological sites. Around 29 clan groups of the Eora Nation inhabited the region at the time of European contact.[13] During his first Pacific voyage in 1770, Lieutenant James Cook and his crew became the first Europeans to chart the eastern coast of Australia, making landfall at Botany Bay and inspiring British interest in the area. In 1788, the First Fleet of convicts, led by Arthur Phillip, founded Sydney as a British penal colony, the first European settlement in Australia. Phillip named the settlement after Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney.[14] Penal transportation to New South Wales ended soon after Sydney was incorporated as a city in 1842. A gold rush occurred in the colony in 1851, and over the next century, Sydney transformed from a colonial outpost into a major global cultural and economic centre. After World War II, it experienced mass migration and became one of the most multicultural cities in the world.[2]."

[05-Sep-21 08:25 PM] Cam T#6441
What do you think


[05-Sep-21 08:27 PM] inactive#6974
I believe that Kambalda, in Western Australia. 
We should look for a capital that doesn't buy into the wars between the states, particularly on our eastern coast, and it needs to be a place in which fairness, equality and love is shared. So why Kambalda you ask?

Kambalda in 2016 was ruled by a tribe of about 250 wild goats. Goats are amazing loving creatures, and why wouldn't you want hundreds of these little legends becoming your new rulers?

Say hi to Gary guys!!

This is a trick question! We should NOT choose a new capital, because our current capital of Canberra is the greatest city in the world!
