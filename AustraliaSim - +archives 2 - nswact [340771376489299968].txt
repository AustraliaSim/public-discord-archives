Nah haha we're not that organised


[28-Oct-17 08:21 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
It's just drinks/social


[28-Oct-17 08:21 PM] rhaums#6869
it could be cool to try onetime


[28-Oct-17 08:21 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
there'd be a brawl if the socialists came! haha

[05-Nov-17 02:06 PM] Hoog#6115
also I was depressed and I failed my classes and the uni kicked me out and I lost my student allowance so I had no money for rent so I had to go home and so my girlfriend broke up with me


[05-Nov-17 02:07 PM] Hoog#6115
which was the only reason I was there in the first place really


[05-Nov-17 02:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[07-Nov-17 08:13 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Maybe we should avoid the city?


[07-Nov-17 08:13 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
So it's less expensive


[07-Nov-17 08:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

Yes, but there aren't really good places to just socialise, eat, chat, and drink in the city

@Catiline that ATAR is from last year isn't it? Or have they changed it?


[05-Feb-18 09:07 PM] Catiline#0267
each uni does it differently


[05-Feb-18 09:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh yeah, and that


[05-Feb-18 09:07 PM] Catiline#0267
maybe it was last year's cutoff


[05-Feb-18 09:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
actually I think it was like 74 when I applied


[05-Feb-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah


[05-Feb-18 09:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
down to 71


[05-Feb-18 09:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
so this year may have fallen again


[05-Feb-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
And the cut off is based on demand anyway


[05-Feb-18 09:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
indeed, 'tis


[05-Feb-18 09:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's why stuff like Physio and Journalism is over 95 when you don't really need that level to be either


[05-Feb-18 09:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
well, journalism is in my degree which, as mentioned, is 71


[05-Feb-18 09:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Physio is off the charts for some reason


[05-Feb-18 09:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
not high paying or anything


[05-Feb-18 09:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
just the demand

Yes, that's my major


[05-Feb-18 09:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
PR major in a Communication degree


[05-Feb-18 09:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
they threw them all together into that one degree


[05-Feb-18 09:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
for some reason


[05-Feb-18 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
So is it communications or journalism that is your degree?


[05-Feb-18 09:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Communication is the degree


[05-Feb-18 09:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
My *major* is PR

@BellmanTGM all the smart, sporty kids do phsyio at my school


[24-Feb-18 01:29 PM] luxxy#6392
Like every school captain does it


[24-Feb-18 01:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yeah dude my school was the same


[24-Feb-18 01:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It‚Äôs strange tho


[24-Feb-18 01:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Like physio isn‚Äôt that high paying a field


[24-Feb-18 01:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But it‚Äôs got massive demand


[24-Feb-18 01:30 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I guess it‚Äôs like medicine but sporty idk, people reckon it fun.


[24-Feb-18 01:31 PM] luxxy#6392
Yeah idk


[24-Feb-18 01:31 PM] luxxy#6392
Doesn't even sound that great


[24-Feb-18 01:31 PM] luxxy#6392
Everyone at my school wants to do engineering and physio and science


[24-Feb-18 01:31 PM] luxxy#6392
And they're like "what do you want to do"


[24-Feb-18 01:31 PM] luxxy#6392
And I'm like "commerce"


[24-Feb-18 01:31 PM] luxxy#6392
And very few people in my year want to do commerce


[24-Feb-18 01:31 PM] luxxy#6392
Weird aye


[24-Feb-18 01:32 PM] djello#5901
Haha same at my school


[24-Feb-18 01:32 PM] djello#5901
re physio


[24-Feb-18 01:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Hm, yeah no one wants to do commerce


[24-Feb-18 01:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Most people at my school didn‚Äôt really know what they wanted to do tbh


[24-Feb-18 01:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Just the few that were set on physio


[24-Feb-18 01:32 PM] luxxy#6392
I know what I want to do


[24-Feb-18 01:32 PM] luxxy#6392
I was considering teaching


[24-Feb-18 01:32 PM] luxxy#6392
But I just saw it wasn't worth it


[24-Feb-18 01:33 PM] luxxy#6392
I want money and opportunities


[24-Feb-18 01:33 PM] luxxy#6392
To work in various places


[24-Feb-18 01:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Teaching is really popular


[24-Feb-18 01:33 PM] luxxy#6392
Plus ive always loved business and finance and stuff


[24-Feb-18 01:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Because it‚Äôs very clear where you get the jobs


[24-Feb-18 01:33 PM] luxxy#6392

UoN seems to produce a lot of PE teachers


[24-Feb-18 01:34 PM] luxxy#6392
True


[24-Feb-18 01:34 PM] luxxy#6392
Most of my teachers come from newy or acu


[24-Feb-18 01:34 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yeah I know a few people who either are doing or want to do PE teaching at UoN


[24-Feb-18 01:34 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But there is a massive over supply of PE teachers


[24-Feb-18 01:34 PM] djello#5901
I just don't understand their fascination with it


[24-Feb-18 01:35 PM] djello#5901
yeah


[24-Feb-18 01:35 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
PE teaching is for the people that wanted to do physio but missed it lol


[24-Feb-18 01:35 PM] luxxy#6392
My mate wants to be a pe teacher but doesn't want to do phsyio tho


[24-Feb-18 01:35 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[24-Feb-18 01:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

You get textbook allowance and your ammenrity fees paid for


[24-Feb-18 01:41 PM] luxxy#6392
It's not a scholarship


[24-Feb-18 01:41 PM] luxxy#6392
That's why they're unpopular


[24-Feb-18 01:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well that‚Äôs ok


[24-Feb-18 01:42 PM] luxxy#6392
But you can get 4 years experience before you graduate


[24-Feb-18 01:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
