NT statehood


[22-Jul-18 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Something I pushed for as Senator for the Territories and MP of Lingiari


[22-Jul-18 12:02 PM] Perekai#6805
NT statehood doesn't do a service to anyone, to be honest.


[22-Jul-18 12:09 PM] waltor#3519
Merge NT and QLD


[22-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Perekai#6805
There's a reason to why SA gave us up hahaha.


[22-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Perekai#6805
QLD has enough problems on their own.


[22-Jul-18 12:09 PM] waltor#3519

tax haven for mining


[22-Jul-18 12:11 PM] Perekai#6805
The NT is just one huge tax haven, really. I think nearly a quarter of the NT's revenue comes from the federal government.
