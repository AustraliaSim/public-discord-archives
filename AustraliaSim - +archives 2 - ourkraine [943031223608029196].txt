**Servant of the People**
This article is about the Ukrainian TV series. For the political party of the same name, see Servant of the People (political party). For other uses, see Servant of the People (disambiguation).
Servant of the People (Ukrainian: Слуга народу, romanized: Sluha Narodu, sometimes translated as Servant of the Nation) is a Ukrainian political satire comedy television series that premiered on 16 October 2015. It tells the story of Vasyl Petrovych Holoborodko (Volodymyr Zelensky), a high-school history teacher in his thirties who is unexpectedly elected President of Ukraine after a viral video filmed by one of his students shows him making a profane rant against government corruption in Ukraine.[1][2][3]

The series is produced by Kvartal 95, which was founded by Volodymyr Zelensky, the male lead.[4] It would become much more involved in Ukraine's actual politics; on 31 March 2018, a political party named after the television series was registered with the Ministry of Justice.[5] Furthermore, Zelensky, who played the protagonist of the series as the President of Ukraine, was actually elected President of Ukraine on 21 April 2019 with over 70 percent of the second-round vote.[6][7]

Ukraine (Ukrainian: Україна, romanized: Ukraïna, pronounced [ʊkrɐˈjinɐ] (listen)) is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the second-largest country by area in Europe after Russia, which it borders to the east and north-east.[a] Ukraine also shares borders with Belarus to the north; Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; Romania and Moldova to the south; and has a coastline along the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. It spans an area of 603,628 km2 (233,062 sq mi),[b] with a population of 41.3 million,[c] and is the eighth-most populous country in Europe. The nation's capital and largest city is Kyiv.

It will never not be funny that they still elected him president because he talked about corruption once, wasn't openly an oligarch (at the time at least) and was on Tv as one. It'd be like us election Shaun Micallef because he played the PM once

[15-Feb-22 06:01 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
"His visit comes as the US state department urged its citizens in Belarus to leave, citing an “increase in unusual and concerning Russian military activity near the border with Ukraine”."
Lol, fucking what...


[15-Feb-22 06:01 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Next thing they'll be warning Norway and South Korea about Russian border activities


[15-Feb-22 06:02 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Not quite since they aren't exactly involved in a potential war with Ukraine are they


[15-Feb-22 06:03 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Why the fuck would Belarus get involved?


[15-Feb-22 06:04 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Because Belarus is a close ally of Russia and there are thousands of Russian troops in Belarus along the ukranian border


[15-Feb-22 06:05 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
So I wouldn't exactly say their situation is comparable to Norway or South Korea


[15-Feb-22 06:08 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Yes, which is exactly why it's a strange warning. It's not like Russia is going to start attacking Belarus


[15-Feb-22 06:10 PM] BHjr132#2979
Because the war will spill over into Belarus

[15-Feb-22 06:17 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Yes, which is exactly why they'll keep the war out of Belarus and in Ukraine if it were to even happen


[15-Feb-22 06:18 PM] дётrivøre#5054

[15-Feb-22 06:18 PM] дётrivøre#5054

[15-Feb-22 06:18 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I believe most countries current relations with Belarus is: Status: Sanctioned


[15-Feb-22 06:19 PM] BHjr132#2979
I mean Russia is going to be marching into Ukraine from Belarus, not exactly a safe place to be with the entire Russian military moving about


[15-Feb-22 06:19 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I expect the Russian troops stationed on the Belarus/Ukraine border are solely to defend Belarus from any counter-attack from Ukraine rather than to invade from Belarus


[15-Feb-22 06:20 PM] BHjr132#2979
They’d be dumb not to attack from Belarus because it’s a short walk to Kyiv rather than a long slog from Crimea and the east


[15-Feb-22 06:20 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Any counter-attack from within Ukraine would likely go through Belarus; Russia would do anything it could to stop that from happening


[15-Feb-22 06:20 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Attacking from Belarus gives the Russians the fastest path to Kiev if that is something they are wanting to do


[15-Feb-22 06:21 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And this all assumes Russia wants Kiev anyway which I've already explained I don't believe to be the case


[15-Feb-22 06:22 PM] BHjr132#2979
I don’t think they want Kyiv but you’d want to threaten it to pressure Ukraine to capitulate to the demands


[15-Feb-22 06:22 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
They'd want to capture Kiev and Lviv to get enough war score in the treaty


[15-Feb-22 06:22 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Gotta capture their victory points!!!!


[15-Feb-22 06:23 PM] BHjr132#2979
Doubt they’d bother with Lviv


[15-Feb-22 06:23 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Ukraine is already trying to de-escalate things (because they know they're fucked either way)


[15-Feb-22 06:23 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Which is a bit of an 🇱 for them

[15-Feb-22 06:29 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Credibly we would want Ukraine to win the war. The West already provides and sells enough weapons to the Ukranians, why not limit it to anti air weaponry to diminish the effectiveness and up the costs to the Russian Air Force who will win a war in Ukraine far quicker than the Army


[15-Feb-22 06:29 PM] 12MaxWild#6477

[15-Feb-22 06:33 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's fair to think that especially over a foreign conflict and you should be under no personal obligation to really care. My perspective here is that there is a clear right and wrong in regards to the territorial sovereignty of a state and that those people have a right to defend the sovereignty of their borders if they so choose. I believe the Ukranian cause is right, I care enough to see them win for the sake of those people who live and work in Ukraine as human beings with value to their lives


[15-Feb-22 06:33 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
If you don't care about Ukraine, your entitled to it and I'm supportive of the choice cause it doesn't really effect anyone in the West


[15-Feb-22 06:33 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
If I bothered to read into the conflict I would probably agree with you, Gregor

Yes I agree but it is the obligation of the state to stop them for the sake of preserving the integrity of the state apparatus within the region and to minimize further misery

Anyway yes, I do personally think the Ukrainian cause is just and that Russia invading with no reason would be bad, but that doesn't mean I think we should intervene because we shouldn't, it's not our business. The meme take I hold, and likely the one I will express more often here, is that it would be funny if Russia wins

I did mean generally the Tsarist period of Russia is lame but Ivan the Terrible in terms of being an effective Russian ruler wasn't that bad. I get that's a bit of a "made the trains run on time" argument but it's more how I've always framed the history and analysis of any structures founded in Absolutist monarchies. In a time of legalized mass slavery, the mandate of rape and murder being given to soldiers freely as an expectation of war and the fact that no monarch can really claim morality and to be "just" from the period as they all sat upon and perputrated absolutist systems of tyranny.

Ukraine hit by cyber attack as U.S. questions Russian troop pullback
Ukraine said it had been hit by a cyber attack on Tuesday, appearing to blame Russia, as Moscow's statements about a partial troop pullback were met with Western skepticism.

You probably have quite a few opinions about what's going on in the news cycle right now, but it's important to remember one thing: you're wrong. Here's why. To start, you're completely missing the point and everything you think is actually at odds with reality when you look at the data. In fact, you're nowhere close to being accurate. It's simple to understand when you stop for a second and actually look at the issues. Once you open your eyes, you'll see that you're wrong about each and every one of them, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. "But what about this other thing I heard?" No, if the past is any indication of the future, not only is there no chance that you'll ever be right, all signs suggest you will never even come close once in your lifetime. The only way you'll ever be right is to repeat everything I say word-for-word to every single person you know. Until then, you're wrong.﻿

Claims of attacks on Moscow-backed separatists being ‘reported on widely in Russia’

Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from Kyiv, says a series of alleged attacks by Ukrainian forces on separatist rebels in conflict-hit eastern Ukraine are being “reported on widely in Russia”.

“This is not big news at all, there are times when these sorts of skirmishes are a daily occurrence, but the key to this is the publicity being given to the story in Russia,” he said.
“There is a connection here to the warnings that have been given by the US and NATO about a possible pretext for major action by Russian forces massed around Ukraine’s borders … all it needs is one incident which could be an excuse for Russia to take action, not necessarily a full invasion but action in the disputed areas held by the Russian-backed separatists.”

its just so they can claim anything that happens is a false flag


[17-Feb-22 10:07 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Exactly why I'm trying to give it benefit of the doubt until confirmed to be genuine or false flag. It's the kind of thing that could easily be either


[17-Feb-22 10:07 PM] Trask#2574
Two forces mostly made up of irregular troops on either side of a battlefront they have been fighting over for more than half a decade taking potshots at each other is not a "false flag attack" and never will be


[17-Feb-22 10:08 PM] Trask#2574
its a misuse of the term either way


[17-Feb-22 10:08 PM] Trask#2574
if the Russians blew up one of their own ship in the Black Sea and then said it was the Americans, that would be a false flag attack.


[17-Feb-22 10:13 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
If it was a Russian unit sent to make an attack look like it was from the Ukrainian military, that would be a false flag


[17-Feb-22 10:13 PM] Viado Celtru#6988

Holy shit no fucking way


[19-Feb-22 06:14 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
That's more than a quarter of the people of Donetsk they wouldn't just upend them for no reason unless there was legitimacy behind the plans


[19-Feb-22 06:14 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Since it would be horrifically unpopular


[19-Feb-22 06:17 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Also in Luhansk supposedly though I can't find an exact number


[19-Feb-22 06:17 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I think that it's one of threee things which changes my stance on the issue


[19-Feb-22 06:19 AM] Cam T#6441
Y is it called ourkane here

Is it the same thing but it’s a joke?


[19-Feb-22 06:19 AM] Cam T#6441
Or does it mean something


[19-Feb-22 06:20 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's a joke Cam


[19-Feb-22 06:21 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
1: It's a complete and utter bluff and they don't move the full 700k in Donetsk and unknown numbers in Luhansk and instead just move smaller groups of civilians and claim the full total of people leaving to continue playing diplomatic chicken (What this probably is)

2: This is actually the precussor to a ceasefire and truce violation and the continuation of the Donbass War as a full intensity conflict with continued Russian assistance in secret (Most likely move if they went for the full population shift with undeniable evidence)

3: Russia seriously plans to invade (Most unlikely in my mind)


[19-Feb-22 06:21 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
If this seriously does occur then 2 is the most likely


[19-Feb-22 06:22 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's a joke about how you say the name in English

So the goat was given to the tiger in a nashional park to b food


[19-Feb-22 06:33 AM] Cam T#6441
But the goat didn’t fear the tiger


[19-Feb-22 06:33 AM] Cam T#6441
And he kicked the tiger out of his lare


[19-Feb-22 06:34 AM] Cam T#6441
And they were friends


[19-Feb-22 06:34 AM] Cam T#6441
But sadly one day the tiger hurt the goat when the goat kicked him.


[19-Feb-22 06:34 AM] Cam T#6441
It was playing but the goat was hurt a bit so a vet came to check the goat

Biden sure Putin will invade Ukraine in days as civilians bussed out
Russia's Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine within days, U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday after separatists backed by Moscow told civilians to leave breakaway regions on buses, a move the West fears is part of a pretext for an attack.

The fact remains: Russian troops currently have Ukraine surrounded from Belarus to the Black Sea in the south — and along Ukraine’s borders. 
 
We have reason to believe Russian forces are planning and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming days.

[20-Feb-22 06:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I would normally think so too, but the amount of time, money and effort spent is so great that it is hard to envision it being just some attempt to try threaten but not actually go to war*

It's why I think he'll attack Ukraine unless he gets given quite a major concession that he can trumpet as the west capitulating


[20-Feb-22 06:53 PM] Trask#2574
I think that's where we are headed


[20-Feb-22 06:54 PM] Trask#2574
a major concession.


[20-Feb-22 06:54 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
A partition of Ukraine with eastern Ukraine absorbed into Russia or at least a Belarus style puppet government is probably what he'll be happy with


[20-Feb-22 06:54 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Munich 2.0


[20-Feb-22 06:54 PM] Trask#2574
I think it will just be Donbas personally


[20-Feb-22 06:54 PM] Trask#2574
Nothing that major


[20-Feb-22 06:55 PM] Trask#2574
Munich was very different. The sections of the country that are going to be annexed were not occupied by pro-German rebels


[20-Feb-22 06:55 PM] Trask#2574
Also Hitler actually wanted a war


[20-Feb-22 06:56 PM] Trask#2574
Putin does not. He would lose, badly.

[20-Feb-22 06:57 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Like fair's fair it's basically uniformly left of centre people that post :laser: and :yeahok: instead of making a point


[20-Feb-22 06:57 PM] Trask#2574
Fake news. Hitler wanted to destroy France and take back Alsace-Lorraine. The only European power he didn't want to fight was the United Kingdom


[20-Feb-22 06:57 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I do think sometimes they can be useful but universally it's just "you're wrong and I can't be bothered to challenge you"


[20-Feb-22 06:58 PM] Trask#2574
he anticipated and was ready for a European war, but Munich avoided it and stifled his plans


[20-Feb-22 06:58 PM] BloodyChrome#8410
When they declared war he pushed them.off the continent not wanting to have to deal with a second front. Had they not declared war would've he still gone through France? Maybe but only if he felt that front was going to be exposed


[20-Feb-22 07:00 PM] Trask#2574
If France had abandoned Poland he would have gone for them next


[20-Feb-22 07:00 PM] Trask#2574
Alsace-Lorraine was a non-negotiable part of the Nazi program


[20-Feb-22 07:05 PM] BloodyChrome#8410
Russia was the bigger threat since they were communist

[21-Feb-22 08:08 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
no but don't you understand? power in kleptocracies is defined solely by how many seats in parliament you have!!


[21-Feb-22 08:09 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
and unless you are part of Ukrainian Party of Neo-Nazis (Nazism) then you aren't a neo-nazi!


[21-Feb-22 08:51 AM] дётrivøre#5054
Of course!


[21-Feb-22 08:51 AM] дётrivøre#5054
I’ve been thinking, and it would be really clever of Putin to not actually have one single invasion and instead to very gradually infiltrate and covertly take over much of the country


[21-Feb-22 08:52 AM] дётrivøre#5054
That would make it difficult for his opponents to even know an invasion has begun


[21-Feb-22 09:35 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I have literally never seen anyone say "Ukraine is run by Neo-Nazis", that's an insane strawman argument


[21-Feb-22 09:39 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Simultaneously, a country can be not run by neo-Nazis, and still have quite a few neo-Nazis in it who hold quite a bit of power


[21-Feb-22 09:42 AM] Viado Celtru#6988

Nothing in it actually obligates us to defend Ukraine

https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Ukraine._Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances
Ukraine. Memorandum on Security Assurances
Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America,
Welcoming the Accession of Ukraine to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-weapon state,
Taking into account the commitment of Ukraine to eliminate all nuclear weapons from its territory ...


[21-Feb-22 01:31 PM] дётrivøre#5054
It’s quite short and probably worth a read


[21-Feb-22 02:08 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
One could argue section 4 would apply here


[21-Feb-22 02:09 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Eh, it says UNSC action


[21-Feb-22 02:09 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Not unilateral action


[21-Feb-22 02:09 PM] дётrivøre#5054
So unless and until the UNSC agrees to involve the UN, which it won't, we're off the hook


[21-Feb-22 02:10 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I would also argue other countries should hold violators of sections 1 and 2 to account


[21-Feb-22 02:11 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Realistically this isn't legally binding anyway, but the spirit of it(to me anyway) would compel that we defend Ukraine


[21-Feb-22 02:11 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
And aside from the treaty, I don't like the idea of abandoning anyone to Russia, or any other dictatorship for that matter


[21-Feb-22 02:11 PM] дётrivøre#5054
From a strategic standpoint, I see no advantage to going to war


[21-Feb-22 02:12 PM] дётrivøre#5054
My point is that legally, there is no written US commitment to Ukraine


[21-Feb-22 02:12 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Of course not, even if the Budapest memo said it outright it wouldn't be legally binding


[21-Feb-22 02:13 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
But our commitments shouldn't have to be legally binding for us to follow through with them


[21-Feb-22 02:13 PM] дётrivøre#5054
I don't mean binding, I just mean a commitment


[21-Feb-22 02:13 PM] дётrivøre#5054
There is none there


[21-Feb-22 02:13 PM] дётrivøre#5054
We have commitments to NATO even though that's not binding


[21-Feb-22 02:13 PM] дётrivøre#5054
We have commitments to Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan


[21-Feb-22 02:13 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
And to me we made an implied commitment to help them in exchange for them surrendering their nuclear weapons


[21-Feb-22 02:13 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Eh, nothing in the text of the agreement said we'd help them


[21-Feb-22 02:14 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Well to be fair that's why I said implied


[21-Feb-22 02:14 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I just really do not like the idea of leaving them to Russia


[21-Feb-22 02:14 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
This doesn't work


[21-Feb-22 02:14 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
We know it doesn't we found out all the way back in world war II


[21-Feb-22 02:14 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
He will just keep taking over countries


[21-Feb-22 02:15 PM] дётrivøre#5054
I don't think so


[21-Feb-22 02:15 PM] дётrivøre#5054
He's got limited economic resources and American allies from Estonia to Romania


[21-Feb-22 02:16 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
it is absurd to compare Putin's goals to those of Nazi Germany


[21-Feb-22 02:16 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
He doesn't have the same goals, no


[21-Feb-22 02:17 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
But there's no reason to think appeasement is suddenly going to work


[21-Feb-22 02:17 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
It never works


[21-Feb-22 02:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
yeah and it's those difference in goals that means he's not just going to keep conquering Europe unless America puts boots on the ground


[21-Feb-22 02:17 PM] дётrivøre#5054
It's not really appeasement, we're not telling Putin he can have Ukraine


[21-Feb-22 02:17 PM] дётrivøre#5054
We just shouldn't send our boys to die for the poorest and most corrupt country in Europe


[21-Feb-22 02:19 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I mean we've been doing nothing but telling him that though. Not in words, but in never bothering to do anything when he actually enters sovereign territories


[21-Feb-22 02:19 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Past performance more or less tells him we will let him have Ukraine


[21-Feb-22 02:19 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
And we will, I have no illusions


[21-Feb-22 02:19 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Just like with crimea, we'll call him a meanie, do nothing else, and then wait until he does it again


[21-Feb-22 02:20 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Putin isn't dumb, he's smart enough to see the pattern that we will never try to stop him and he can functionally do whatever he wants as long as he doesn't touch a NATO member


[21-Feb-22 02:21 PM] дётrivøre#5054
So is it appeasement when we didn't send troops to respond to, for example, Gaddafi taking a chunk of Chad?


[21-Feb-22 02:21 PM] дётrivøre#5054
After all, Gaddafi definitely did have pan-African objectives


[21-Feb-22 02:24 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I think so, yes


[21-Feb-22 02:24 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Look I'm not saying this isn't difficult


[21-Feb-22 02:24 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I don't want a nuclear war anymore than anyone else


[21-Feb-22 02:24 PM] дётrivøre#5054
I suppose you're consistent in that


[21-Feb-22 02:25 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Really I don't want us in a normal war either


[21-Feb-22 02:25 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I think I'm mainly just tired of us abandoning people to be conquered because we can't be bothered to do anything about it


[21-Feb-22 02:26 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
In the case of Russia specifically, I tend to think limiting it's expansion is a good move for us


[21-Feb-22 02:26 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
In a bit of a more selfish point of view, Ukraine is a good buffer zone


[21-Feb-22 02:30 PM] дётrivøre#5054
I wouldn’t say so, I think we’re already much closer than we should be with NATO expansion east


[21-Feb-22 02:30 PM] дётrivøre#5054
When the two Germanies unified, we said NATO would go no further east


[21-Feb-22 02:30 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Since then, we have added a whole bunch of states east of Germany to NATO


[21-Feb-22 02:31 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Indeed, the United States track record for keeping its word isn't very good


[21-Feb-22 02:31 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Well and the rest of NATO as well I suppose we couldn't do it single-handedly


[21-Feb-22 02:33 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
This is kind of why it's partly tricky as well


[21-Feb-22 02:33 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Because I can kind of see where Putin's coming from


[21-Feb-22 02:34 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I still don't particularly like the idea of just abandoning Ukraine to Russia


[21-Feb-22 02:34 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I also don't like the idea of a nuclear war, or any war for that matter

Putin orders Russian forces to 'maintain peace' in eastern Ukraine'...
President Vladimir Putin orders his Defence Ministry to dispatch Russian forces to maintain peace in eastern Ukraine's two breakaway regions, the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, after he said Moscow would recognise their independence.

RUSSIA HAS INVADED UKRAINE ||BUT ONLY THE BITS THEY BASICALLY ALREADY CONTROL||


[22-Feb-22 10:59 AM] 12MaxWild#6477
Exactly


[22-Feb-22 11:17 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
To be clear I don't "support" either of them insofar that I think that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is obviously wrong and that these are obviously nothing more than Russian puppet states, but I generally dislike broad generalisations such as "supporting XYZ makes you ABC"


[22-Feb-22 11:17 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
The Russian government is Bad, sure, but I think it's a reach to say they're as bad as Imperial Japan or Nazi Germany


[22-Feb-22 11:19 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
the people in these regions want to be Russian puppets


[22-Feb-22 11:19 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
they don't want to be part of Ukraine


[22-Feb-22 11:20 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
it's bizarre that self determination is cool and based in Quebec, Catalonia, and Scotland, but not cool in Ukraine


[22-Feb-22 11:20 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
it's just the last vestiges of Cold Warrior Brain


[22-Feb-22 11:24 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I do broadly agree but I don't think that justifies a Russian invasion


[22-Feb-22 11:28 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Do they actually, or are they being forced into it. It's not like these rebels had enough popular support to breakaway on their own, the required manpower and equipment from Russia to do so. Russia moving troops in today is just the official army moving in, Russian troops have been in these regions for years propping up the "resistance" movement


[22-Feb-22 11:29 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Ukraine has had military support from the West since the fall of the Soviet Union. Of course a separatist group couldn't defeat the Ukrainian military on their own


[22-Feb-22 11:29 AM] Perekai#6805
The difference is that Scotland’s self determination isn’t being supported by an imperialist neighbour, and Catalonia is definitely not popular for self-determination. And unless I’m shown otherwise, I don’t think there was plurality support for joining Russia when they split away in 2014.


[22-Feb-22 11:29 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Catalonia would be blown out in a war with Spain


[22-Feb-22 11:29 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
The referendum in Crimea was as legitimate as the Belarus election, not the people actually wanting to join Russia


[22-Feb-22 11:30 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
the only real objection people seem to have is that Donetsk is successful


[22-Feb-22 11:31 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
and that all of this support for separatist movements is in fact virtue signalling from twitter socdems who see #FreeScotland and decide they can show how woke they are


[22-Feb-22 11:32 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I do think that there's significant truth to the statement that a significant number of eastern Ukrainians, possibly a majority, do want to join Russia


[22-Feb-22 11:32 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
That doesn't mean that the Russian referendums with like 95% support are legitimate, or that it justifies an invasion, but I do think that it's probably a correct statement


[22-Feb-22 11:32 AM] Perekai#6805
I think the objection is Russia’s encroachment on neighbouring countries. I don’t have a particular aversion to Donetsk leaving, I have a distrust of Russia who is known to have imperialist ambitions towards their neighbours.


[22-Feb-22 11:35 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Scotland is British !!!


[22-Feb-22 11:35 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
i would also say that the sword cuts both ways, and while there may not be popular will for leaving Ukraine, such that local militias could win a protracted struggle on their own, there is clearly no popular will for staying with Ukraine either


[22-Feb-22 11:36 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
The problem here is that it is so hard to find out what the people actually want due to all the outside influence


[22-Feb-22 11:36 AM] Perekai#6805
And I think that is a sticky situation for sure, but I don’t think Russia’s or the US’s intervention is in the interest of anyone’s self determination, but rather their own imperialistic goals.


[22-Feb-22 11:37 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Yeah pretty much this


[22-Feb-22 11:37 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Like I would say a similar situation applies to Ukraine and NATO


[22-Feb-22 11:40 AM] Perekai#6805
I guess the difference is that NATO is joined by a vote. If Ukrainians want to join NATO, it’s by democratic mandate. Which is better than the alternative that Russia is offering right now.


[22-Feb-22 11:41 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
certainly Russia isn't doing anything out of the kindness of its own heart


[22-Feb-22 11:41 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
but nobody is


[22-Feb-22 11:42 AM] Perekai#6805
Yeah, nobody is. Russian imperialism is imperialism, and their encroachment on a separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine has, in my opinion, damaged any peaceful attempts at a democratic solution.


[22-Feb-22 11:44 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
my position is that sanctions are likely to accomplish nothing except the impoverishment of ordinary Russians and potentially widespread death such as is seen in Iran


[22-Feb-22 11:47 AM] 12MaxWild#6477
Self determination is not cool or based in those regions


[22-Feb-22 11:47 AM] 12MaxWild#6477
Imperialism is poggers


[22-Feb-22 11:49 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I think the best outcome would be a democratic solution but Ukraine would likely be fiercely opposed to any attempt for secession in the east, just like Spain with Catalonia


[22-Feb-22 11:49 AM] Perekai#6805
I don’t disagree, but I don’t think the onus in on European countries.They’d rather force Russia down with sanctions than war, which will lead to the impoverishment of ordinary Ukrainian citizens. The best option for all civilians is if Russia backs down. Europe shouldn’t be expected to continue to prop up an economy that is actively destabilising a country that was liberalising and aligning itself with Europe.


[22-Feb-22 11:50 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
And obviously no democratic solution can really occur wih the backdrop of war


[22-Feb-22 11:51 AM] Perekai#6805
Oh and if the suffering of ordinary citizens is your thing, Russia occupying Chechnya and propping up Lukashenko isn’t doing anyone any favours.


[22-Feb-22 11:54 AM] Perekai#6805
Look I seriously dislike the encroachment of the US into the Ukraine, sticking their fat nose into the business of other countries, but imperialism is imperialism. Russia is the aggressor, and they have been since 2014 when they occupied Crimea and lied about having their soldiers in Donbas.


[22-Feb-22 11:54 AM] General_Rommel#0190

Ironically, many of the countries against Russia's occupation of rebellious Ukrainian states are themselves, illegal occupiers of lands that don't belong to them :emotiguy:


[22-Feb-22 04:12 PM] Trask#2574
The truth is this is a good resolution to the crisis. Ukraine has had more than half a decade to resolve the situation there peacefully. There were proposals on the cards like increased federalisation that could have avoided this but they were not pursued. The only way out was a Russian annexation. The political and diplomatic limbo that existed there was unsustainable


[22-Feb-22 04:14 PM] Trask#2574
People will flip their shit over it but remember this whole thing was facilitated by the Western reaction, which was always more about seeming "hard" on the big bad enemy Russia than actually maintaining Ukraine as a viable nation instead of an extractivist colonial project


[22-Feb-22 04:14 PM] дётrivøre#5054
I expect the Russians to also pour money and media into the next Ukrainian elections so they can get a Belarus-style client in Kiev


[22-Feb-22 04:14 PM] Trask#2574

[22-Feb-22 04:16 PM] Trask#2574
Western nations have a vested interest in maintaining Ukraine as a corrupt backwater.


[22-Feb-22 04:20 PM] Perekai#6805
I'm not sure that the only two solutions post-Euromaiden was to let Yanukovych either a) remain in power to appease Russia or b) give up Donbas. It just doesn't seem like this had to be an unavoidable, written in stone approach from Russia. They were the ones who escalated tensions with the invasion of Crimea in 2014 after the Euromaiden protests, so why would Ukraine have any interest in trying to warm those relations or to buckle to Moscow and give them Donbas? It just doesn't seem like this is somehow entirely Ukraine's fault.


[22-Feb-22 04:20 PM] Trask#2574
Much as Latin America has historically been deliberately underdeveloped in an effort to maintain the countries there as sources of natural resources, Eastern Europe has been jocked over by German and Russian capital as resource colonies since the fall of the Soviet Union.


[22-Feb-22 04:21 PM] дётrivøre#5054
I don't think so, especially in such a corrupt country where the course can be changed in an instant


[22-Feb-22 04:21 PM] Perekai#6805
It's also worth mentioning that Russia had agreed to maintain the sovereignty of Ukraine's borders post Soviet collapse in exchange for the Soviet ICBMs stationed there. So it's not like these borders were somehow punitive or completely disagreeable to the Russians.

Why there are so many Russian speakers in Ukraine who want out


[22-Feb-22 04:29 PM] Perekai#6805
Obviously borders can change for good reasons like ethnic reasons (and I think they should), but I don't think the annexation of Crimea and Russian troops in Donbas was the right way to go about that. Unless I'm shown otherwise, I'm not even convinced that a plurality of citizens in Donbas or Crimea support joining the Russian Federation.

Russia was fine to prop up Yanukovych in exchange for seemingly nothing other than a Russian aligned Ukraine, and it's the same with Belarus. So when the Ukraine, through popular support of the population removed Yanukovych, Russia as the aggressor had annexed Crimea.


[22-Feb-22 04:31 PM] Trask#2574

[22-Feb-22 04:37 PM] Perekai#6805
Russia is an aggressor. So is the US for doing what they do by sticking their noses where they don't belong, but Russia's approach to Crimea and Donbas has been imperialistic.

They're entitled to if they wish, but you should be conducting referendums. Even in Crimea when they called for a referendum the options were "yes" or "yes" and they didn't allow in international observers. The most accurate information we have prior to the separation was that most people did not support leaving Ukraine in Donbas.


[22-Feb-22 04:54 PM] Trask#2574
Yeah but we don't live in a shared reality anymore


[22-Feb-22 04:54 PM] Trask#2574
Plebiscites are meaningless

[22-Feb-22 04:56 PM] Perekai#6805
Probably would go a long way to prove that you represent the overall will of the people you claim to have, as opposed to just occupying the territory. Seems more likely that they knew they didn't have popular support and elected to skip it because it would, as you say, contradict their interests.


[22-Feb-22 04:56 PM] Perekai#6805
They're entitled to self determination, they're just not entitled to dragging along everyone else who isn't interested.

I mean would it matter to you if they were corrupt? Because it seems they were. Allowing Russian troops who weren't supposed to be there to vote is pretty wild. Seems sort of like putting the cart before the horse calling elections that are now mostly unverifiable after you've already seized control.


[22-Feb-22 06:24 PM] Perekai#6805
Yeah go for it, if they do then let them secede lmao.


[22-Feb-22 06:25 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
It's not that they care, but if they are strongly backing Russia then it makes it hard for the west to go hard against Russia


[22-Feb-22 06:30 PM] Trask#2574
I put zero stock in any poll, plebiscite, ect


[22-Feb-22 06:31 PM] Trask#2574
It all means nothing


[22-Feb-22 06:38 PM] Perekai#6805
That's fine if you do but that's sort of weird because you brought up the elections. You can just admit you're fine with how they seceded. I don't have any stock in the matter, but it doesn't sit right with me on how it was conducted. I can't excuse Russian imperialism simply because I dislike EU/US imperialism as well.


[22-Feb-22 07:05 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I don't think China is backing Russia. In fact, I think China would beat Russia if the 2 went to war. The only reason they haven't is because of massive trade connections between the 2 countries. It's less so 'we're friends' and more so 'everyone else hates us but our trade routes and economies dominate a large portion of the world so fighting each other is pointless'


[22-Feb-22 07:06 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
In terms of Ukraine, I don't think China cares about Ukraine at all and backs neither Russia nor NATO; basically avoiding anything to do with it


[22-Feb-22 07:15 PM] Deleted User#0482
Before people were saying that when russia invades ukraine, china will invade taiwan but obviously that wont happen, china isnt prepared yet to take it. But yes china doesnt care


[22-Feb-22 07:20 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Lol, China (PRC) can't invade an area of land that most nations and the UN recognise as PRC sovereignty


[22-Feb-22 07:21 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And I honestly doubt they will try it anytime soon. If they really wanted Taiwan they would've taken it decades ago


[22-Feb-22 07:22 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
What China least wants is the US on its doorstep, much the same as Russia


[22-Feb-22 07:23 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It's why China tries so hard to appease North Korea and keep the country stable so as to avoid the US coming in if things go haywire


[22-Feb-22 07:27 PM] дётrivøre#5054
China also won’t take Taiwan because there are significant cultural and economic ties, Taiwan has a significant military, and the US said it would guarantee Taiwanese independence just a few years ago


[22-Feb-22 07:27 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It doesn't want a US backed country that close and it will avoid a US occupation of Taiwan as much as possible. Meanwhile Taiwan, run by ROC claims sovereignty over all of China which no-one important recognises. This means Taiwan can't become an independent country which ironically benefits both China and Taiwan


[22-Feb-22 07:28 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
An independent Taiwan would destroy Taiwan's powerhouse economy


[22-Feb-22 07:29 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Both China and Taiwan mutually benefit from being the 'same country' yet claiming contradicting sovereignties


[22-Feb-22 07:30 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I doubt the US would back an independent Taiwan either; it's probably their greatest trade asset through to mainland China (on par with HK)


[22-Feb-22 07:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
tbh


[22-Feb-22 07:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
really comes down to costs v benefits


[22-Feb-22 07:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
the cost is still relatively high


[22-Feb-22 07:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
risk of failure still weighs


[22-Feb-22 07:31 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It lets the US put trade sanctions of 'China' while continuing to trade with China via Taiwan


[22-Feb-22 07:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
also cost of many deaths


[22-Feb-22 07:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and unknown cost of possible intervention from other nations to shore up taiwan


[22-Feb-22 07:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
but the costs keep coming down relatively speaking as china continues to grow


[22-Feb-22 07:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
right now, today, I think china would 'win' if they invaded today


[22-Feb-22 07:31 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
TLDR 
China doesn't really want to invade Taiwan
The US doesn't really want to invade Taiwan
Taiwan likes being stuck in limbo


[22-Feb-22 07:32 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Everyone benefits from this ^


[22-Feb-22 07:39 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
The most ironic thing I could possibly imagine is the US trying to invade Taiwan for 'Taiwan's independent sovereignty' only for China to overwhelmingly win and then go invade Guam for 'Guam's independent sovereignty' :emotiguy:


[22-Feb-22 07:40 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I see no reason why the US would invade Taiwan


[22-Feb-22 07:40 PM] General_Rommel#0190
as in they wouldn't be the first mover


[22-Feb-22 07:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It wouldn't be the first time the US has done something that rash


[22-Feb-22 07:42 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I absolutely doubt they would, they'd lose all the economic benefits of Taiwan by doing so


[22-Feb-22 07:42 PM] General_Rommel#0190
as in


[22-Feb-22 07:42 PM] General_Rommel#0190
taiwan is not an antagonistic power


[22-Feb-22 07:42 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And I doubt the war profiteers would make enough from it to convince the US government otherwise


[22-Feb-22 07:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
the us doesnt consider taiwan to be a threat


[22-Feb-22 07:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
the us invading north korea is frankly more likely


[22-Feb-22 07:43 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Taiwan is not a country recognised by the US


[22-Feb-22 07:44 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Any occupation of Taiwan by US forces would be an illegal occupation of Chinese territory


[22-Feb-22 07:44 PM] General_Rommel#0190
lets avoid these dodgy semantics


[22-Feb-22 07:45 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I say 'invade' because that would be what the US would have to do if it wanted to fight for Taiwan's independence


[22-Feb-22 07:45 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It's not dodgy, it's literally not a UN recognised country


[22-Feb-22 07:46 PM] General_Rommel#0190
its dodgy in the sense that no one practically thinks that


[22-Feb-22 07:46 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
"No-one practically thinks" what the UN and the majority of its member states agree upon :thunk:


[22-Feb-22 07:46 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Just because you don't practically think that does not make it the case


[22-Feb-22 07:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
plz


[22-Feb-22 07:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I simply mean the diplomatic language used by parties obscures the practicalities


[22-Feb-22 07:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
using diplomatic language hinders what the situation really is


[22-Feb-22 07:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I won't deny you are incorrect


[22-Feb-22 07:48 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And what is the situation? A largely peaceful one where everyone benefits by doing nothing


[22-Feb-22 07:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I'm not disagreeing with that either


[22-Feb-22 07:48 PM] Perekai#6805
Talking about international politics is semantics and constantly talking past each other. It is pain.

[22-Feb-22 10:22 PM] BloodyChrome#8410
Because the German Chancellor at the time was swayed and promised things if he agreed. After he resigned he was given a high paying executive job with the Russian company building the pipeline. So why he started the shut down of nuclear power plants

Pretty interesting watch. I do see the argument that Putin is in the position where he basically *has* to do something, even if that something is just trying to take the Donbas. I think Russia's probably digging in for a Georgia-like situation, I doubt they'll push beyond Donetsk and Luhansk. Also I'm absolutely stealing "IQ above room temperature" as an insult

Yeah my prediction for a further push into Ukraine is predicated on if they decided to force a regime change within Ukraine by military force but it's clear they're going to stop at the Donbass based on the current pattern


[23-Feb-22 11:17 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
If they do decide a full scale war with Ukraine then they'll also seize Slobozhanshchnya


[23-Feb-22 11:17 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860

[23-Feb-22 11:54 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Ukraine has enough concern that they have ordered a full mobilisation of their reserves. Presumably they think Russia will push out to secure the whole of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces as they have recognised the whole of both as belonging to the now recognised DPR and LPR


[23-Feb-22 11:56 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I'm not saying there won't be a conflict, I'm saying it probably won't extend beyond Donetsk and Luhansk


[23-Feb-22 11:57 AM] Perekai#6805
Get excited for a protracted meat grinder.


[23-Feb-22 11:58 AM] Perekai#6805
Russia has talked a big game, but this will be their first major mechanised conflict in pretty much ever. Crimea and Chechnya were small, and the troops they had in the Donbas fought a small front against a broken Ukrainian military.


[23-Feb-22 12:00 PM] Perekai#6805
Russian troops in low morale, the mud hasn’t frozen for Russian armour, and the Ukrainians have now a healthy pile of western weapons.

[23-Feb-22 01:30 PM] Perekai#6805
Of course Russia has military superiority, but they're not going to blitzkrieg through Ukraine due to the mud, logistics, and all the AA that western nations have given Ukraine.


[23-Feb-22 01:30 PM] Trask#2574
They aren't going to invade Ukraine period lol


[23-Feb-22 01:30 PM] Perekai#6805

[23-Feb-22 01:31 PM] Perekai#6805

[23-Feb-22 01:32 PM] Trask#2574
The US utterly obliterated the standing militaries of these countries in a matter of days. It's the occupations that were costly and difficult. It's not the same for the Russians because more than half the population in Donbas actually supports them or is at least sympathetic


[23-Feb-22 01:32 PM] Perekai#6805
Look it seems like Russia's military should be competent, but in between all the equipment and their size, they have not realistically been deployed in a large scale conflict pretty much anywhere.


[23-Feb-22 01:32 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I agree that an invasion of Ukraine would be militarily very straightforward for Russia


[23-Feb-22 01:33 PM] Trask#2574
Their military investment in Syria is more serious than you think


[23-Feb-22 01:33 PM] Perekai#6805
Not serious enough to have them prepared for a war on this scale.


[23-Feb-22 01:33 PM] Trask#2574
It's been a constant training ground for their troops


[23-Feb-22 01:35 PM] Perekai#6805
I'm sure their troops have probably a lot of experience facing Syrian rebels in the context of a small international expeditionary force, but this will have the entirety of the Russian military to bear. They have never done this on this scale.


[23-Feb-22 01:35 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Yeah agreed


[23-Feb-22 01:35 PM] Perekai#6805
They will still win, of course they will, but that cost to benefit ratio is going to dwindle really quickly.


[23-Feb-22 01:35 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
This is unprecedented


[23-Feb-22 01:37 PM] Perekai#6805
Trying to push T-72's through the mud in the thawing Ukrainian east is not going to be fun, nor is the logistics of trying to resupply every division from Belarus to Rostov.

what a bizarre euphemism. did they focus group this and find it is less confronting for voters than "guns" or "weapons"?


[23-Feb-22 03:12 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
My favourite thing was seeing the phrase "non-lethal military aid"


[23-Feb-22 03:55 PM] RMSteve#7137
"Very very toxic and lethal military aid" is the euphemism for the discharging of nuclear missiles at an enemy

Do you think Canadians would be appreciative of the expense of this thing?

A planeful of weapons cannot be cheap


[23-Feb-22 04:00 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Especially given that they're Western weapons


[23-Feb-22 04:00 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Let's fly a bunch of million-dollar weapons to the other side of the world so some Russians can kill other Russians

I have a solution to stop all the war. We do the Rocky 4 solution. Vitaly Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv and former heavyweight champion representing Ukraine vs Alexander Potvekin, former interim heavyweight champion representing Russia. Winner gets the country :NODDERS:

I don't think so, since Russia has a rasputitsa of its own

I think tanks and trucks will be fine


[23-Feb-22 04:54 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
they're probably the worst affected by muddy terrain if anything

it won't terribly affect them but it will slow them down

The amount of people here who still think this is WW1 and every tank that falls into a slight ditch somehow blows up or sinks into oblivion is surprising. Do you really think one of the strongest militaries on the planet hasn't considered ***checks notes*** :enlightening: the *muddy terrain*

A spring thaw may be coming, but Russia's tanks 'don't fear mud'
"Our tanks are much better suited for advancing on muddy terrain," a Russian military analyst said. "A thaw can only stop Western tanks."

Every second comment here seems to mention "mud" for some reason


[23-Feb-22 05:40 PM] Trask#2574
a bunch of independent analysts come to the exact same conclusion


[23-Feb-22 05:40 PM] Trask#2574
```Some Ukrainian analysts have acknowledged that the country's air defenses are insufficient in case of a massive Russian assault. Kyiv has prodded its Western allies to provide the country with modern air-defense systems in addition to ground combat weapons provided by the US, Britain and others.

Sunhorovskyi said "the only deterrent is the West's position and the readiness of millions of Ukrainians to fight to the end."

The Kremlin, which has denied having any Ukraine invasion plans, has scoffed at an argument that it wants to see the ground frozen to launch an attack on Ukraine. Ukrainian officials agree that frozen ground or mud isn't an issue.```


[23-Feb-22 05:40 PM] BHjr132#2979
Have you considered the fact that Ukraine is very muddy right now?


[23-Feb-22 05:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
"Mud" is definitely not one of their larger concerns


[23-Feb-22 05:41 PM] 12MaxWild#6477

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasputitsa
Rasputitsa
Rasputitsa (Russian: распу́тица, IPA: [rɐsˈputʲɪtsə]) is a Russian term for two seasons of the year, spring and autumn, when travel on unpaved roads or across country becomes difficult, owing to muddy conditions from rain or melting snow. "Rasputitsa" also refers to road conditions during both periods.

[23-Feb-22 05:45 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
it is objectively easier to go over hard ground than muddy ground regardless of how light your tank is


[23-Feb-22 05:45 PM] Trask#2574
Which they found a way around by massing light tanks


[23-Feb-22 05:45 PM] 12MaxWild#6477

he'll probably stop at the donbas and then pressure ukraine i reckon


[23-Feb-22 05:49 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
If the military really needed to get somewhere, they could literally just build new roads in a day


[23-Feb-22 05:50 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
No doubt, the Nazi's had trouble invading Russia because of terrain and yet they still did it incredibly fast. It's not as big an issue as everyone makes it out


[23-Feb-22 05:50 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
they slowed down because of the mud


[23-Feb-22 05:50 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
the mud wasn't there the whole time


[23-Feb-22 05:51 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
In WW1 absolutely it was. Poor cunts were literally drowning in mud. I can guarantee you won't see anyone slipping into mud and sinking into oblivion in this situation


[23-Feb-22 05:51 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
"Slowed down" perhaps by a matter of days


[23-Feb-22 05:51 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It really wasn't that influential


[23-Feb-22 05:52 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And this was 80 years ago


[23-Feb-22 05:52 PM] Trask#2574
because their tanks were massive


[23-Feb-22 05:52 PM] Trask#2574
Panzer and Tiger tanks were notoriously unsuited to uneven terrain


[23-Feb-22 07:28 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Who cares about mud it literally doesn't effect the war effort!!!


[23-Feb-22 07:31 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
No one is arguing that the Russians being delayed at most a few hours or days by mud would substantively save the Ukranian Armed Forces from a scenario of total military annihilation


[23-Feb-22 07:31 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
At least no one with sense!


[23-Feb-22 07:45 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Even if the mud was likely to cause Russian tanks significant issues, I have this vague sneaking suspicion that they may have spent a little bit of time studying the German invasion of Russia and looking at the impact of weather, mud etc. to plan for how they would avoid being stuck in the same conditions in to event of a war in eastern Europe. Could be wrong and maybe Russian high command for the past 70 years have been utterly incompetent and haven't planned at all

Full scale invasion is beginning in "2 hours" apparently and that was from an hour ago so only one hour left of Ukraine

the funniest outcome is if Russia just rolls over the Ukrainian military and captures the entire country within a day

Message from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
According to the United Forces Command, today, February 24, 5 planes and an aggressor helicopter were shot down in the OS area.
The United Forces give a decent section to the Russian Armed Forces. Military units in their positions. The opponent is taking the losses.
Keep calm and believe in Ukrainian defenders.
Together we will win!
Glory to Ukraine!

This is the danger of miscalculation & human error that can quickly lead to a catastrophic escalation

Do NOT face Putin alone when Astral projecting

Today while astral projecting I summoned putin to try and weaken him so our hexing spells would work better.

He is so fucking powerful. I’m not at a power level to do this alone. I barely escaped with my life and I’m spiritually injured to a great amount, but I think I’ll make it.

I can’t imagine what he would do to a new, unsuspecting witch. I’m scared that I will have to face him again soon if I ever want to continue astral projecting. I’m currently burning healing incense and drawing spiritual energy from my crystals to try and heal as quickly as possible.

Please be safe everyone. Putin is much stronger than I first imagined and we will have to do this together if we want to slay a dictator

This is so bizarre. You'd think that this discourse wouldn't be so polarising. Russia is an imperialist power who invades her neighbours, and so is every other country that uses military aggression to enforce their way.

[24-Feb-22 07:37 PM] Trask#2574
the only way this could ever happen is massive human error, and we are not even close to the level of nuclear readiness for that to be a concern


[24-Feb-22 07:37 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
also you know that even if ww3 happens nuclear weapons probably wont be used right

they aren't gonna go to war and immediately press the red button

That was a series of unwise decisions by European leaders, it was by no means automatic. It’s also the reason we need to oppose all intervention by anyone at every turn.

this is why ww3 will never happen though

[24-Feb-22 07:55 PM] Trask#2574
Think about it from the Ukrainian perspective. They launch a revolution against a pro-Russian government that is popular in the East of the country but barely anywhere else on the promise that if they get rid of the government they will head in the direction of joining NATO, joining the EU, getting rid of corruption and becoming an advanced industrialised country. Not a single one of these things happen as all the promises from the west turn to be empty promises and their country is slowly clawed apart by their largest neighbour.


[24-Feb-22 07:55 PM] Trask#2574
They have been set up for failure.


[24-Feb-22 07:56 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

Russia has started the new wave of aggression against Ukraine. 
Wherever you are and whatever you do, you can help Ukraine now. You can help Ukraine against Russian aggression.

Sosa survived Chiraq, one of the deadliest US warzones


[24-Feb-22 08:34 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Today, history both moves in new direction – and doesn’t. 

The annals of history clearly show that peace and war has always been close to us. So rarely in history has there always been tranquility. And when there has been, it has been imposed with order.  

Australians have been lucky. Lucky that the ideology that the United States, the greatest power of the 20th century, has subscribed to the belief in liberal democracy. And lucky that the United States was willing to use force to preserve their vision of a world order that directly benefits us both economically and politically. 

Today, the cracks in that world order, if it was unclear to some, is now clear to all. History is seemingly reverting to type. The order that the United States built using a combination of ideals, economics and force now looks impotent. 

Ukraine is just the clearest example that the United States’ ability to wage a global war is now checked by the rise of new powers. Russia, and I suspect China and Iran, are nations willing to use force using new weaponry and technology, aided and assisted by the United States neglecting to uphold their own principles, will move into the vacuum. 

It is not just the rise of powerful nations and blocs that do not subscribe to liberal democracy that concerns me. Even if the European Union and India become countervailing influences in world affairs, the fact is that the breakdown in unipolarity creates strategic uncertainty. And with uncertainty comes a much greater risk of warfare.


[24-Feb-22 08:34 PM] General_Rommel#0190
We cannot afford to be complacent. We Australians cannot and should not idle in the face of a changing global environment. This is not necessarily about joining the Australian Defence Force. Rather, this is about rejuvenating our democracy and our society. This is about developing solidarity and ensuring we are united. This is about seeing each other, breaking down silos and working with a shared purpose to upholding liberal democracy. This is about committing to the belief, impossible it might be to fully achieving it, of the value of liberal democracy. 

The alternative is to return back to the natural state of affairs - a state of affairs where we have no destiny over our affairs, no ability to defend ourselves, no ability to shape our society in the way we idealise. It’s up to us to define and defend it.


[24-Feb-22 08:34 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
i think it's hilarious that warfare hinges on morale to such an extent that the media of both sides have to be like "bro we are TOTALLY beating up him so bad bro and also he's crying"

We have severed diplomatic relations with Russia. For all those who have not yet lost their conscience in Russia, it is time to go out and protest against the war with Ukraine.

Ukraine's gorgeous goats compete for beauty crown
A Ukrainian town is so in love with its goats it holds an annual beauty contest for them.
It's a must-see sight, goats in bright dresses, embroidered shirts, skirts and floral crowns. One is even dressed up as a bride.
It's an event not to be missed.

How confusing is the coverage of Ukraine. People on the spot say Kyiv is normal. But the media reports missile attacks and explosions. Is it restricted to disputed areas or is it an invasion of the entire country? The media seems convinced it’s the latter.

So something interesting that could be developing at the UN: Ukraine appears to be laying the groundwork to challenge whether the Russian Federation is the legitimate successor to the USSR’s seat and veto on the Security Council

Bro but Ukrainian sources said that they had pushed Russia out of Kharkiv


[24-Feb-22 09:38 PM] RookWilt#6643
TLDR, The UN Charter was never amended to give Russia the Soviet Seat, so Ukraines logic is that russia isint the sucessor to the USSR and therefore the seat is vacant

> Eleven of the twelve members of the Commonwealth of Independent States signed a declaration on December 21, 1991, agreeing that "Member states of the Commonwealth support Russia in taking over the USSR membership in the UN, including permanent membership in the Security Council."
Unless Ukraine was the one of twelve that didn’t sign, then they already accepted Russia as the successor

[24-Feb-22 11:05 PM] boomfa#6923
Personally I think Ukraine has failed with their battleplans thus far. They didn't get the optimal unit positioning and now won't get the planning bonus or max entrenchment. I would have set a fallback line around Kyiv as well as along the Dnieper to maximise the terrain debuffs for the Russian attackers. Plus arming veterans and militias might seem like a good idea, but they will suffer from the low equipment debuff and won't have the optimal combat width. Also it was unwise for Ukraine to not set their fighters to interception as the Russian tactical bombers were clearly set to strategic bombing with a focus on airfields, and now most of the Ukrainian Airforce is suffering from the overstacking penalty. Best bet at this point would be to improve relations with the west to try to join their faction.

If they ultimately fail I'd just load a previous save and try again with these tactics in mind.


[24-Feb-22 11:08 PM] boomfa#6923
At this point it looks like Russia will pretty quickly cap the major victory points at Kyiv and Kharkiv, but Ukraine's war support is pretty high so we might not see a capitulation until later.

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on state television just now:

“Firstly, this is not the beginning of a war. This is very important. We are trying to prevent developments that could escalate into a global war. And, secondly, this is the end of the war.”

Well, I was wrong. Putin has gone much further than I thought he would. 

A consequence of EU and NATO expansion, which came to a head in 2014. It made no sense to poke the Russian bear with a stick.

These are dark days for Europe.

yeah but I know from my years of HOI4 experience that i'd have this conflict stitched up already


[25-Feb-22 08:59 AM] Trask#2574
I have no clue what Putin's strategic plan even is at this point. I assumed he was more rational than he is.


[25-Feb-22 08:59 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Given the air assaults they launched, it feels like they expected to have a significant chunk of Kiev under control already (or at least a sizable force flown into the airport preparing to assault)


[25-Feb-22 09:00 AM] Trask#2574
From the Russian perspective there was not really any tangible benefit of going to war. They had what they wanted in Donetsk and Luhansk. But Putin really is a Pan-Slavic ideologue, sensed weakness in the proclamations of NATO, and took the big gamble.


[25-Feb-22 09:00 AM] Trask#2574
For all we know those were all probing attacks and they don't plan on occupying large chunks of Western Ukraine for the time being


[25-Feb-22 09:02 AM] Trask#2574
It seems obvious now that they have been planning this for a very long time, since at least last year


[25-Feb-22 09:02 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Pretty big assaults to launch across multiple fronts to not want at least a temporary occupation


[25-Feb-22 09:02 AM] Trask#2574
It could be a ploy to get them to capitulate and cripple their infrastructure.


[25-Feb-22 09:03 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
True


[25-Feb-22 09:03 AM] BHjr132#2979
I think they are just getting a gauge on Ukranian strength before actually going into the major cities


[25-Feb-22 09:03 AM] Trask#2574
best case scenario for Putin is the Ukrainian government surrenders to avoid further loss of life


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] Trask#2574
Or maybe all of these have just been probes and the main attack will come in Donbas. No clue at this point


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Or maybe the Gregor Prediction is right!


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
A big danger for Putin is looking weak. So a successful defence where their gains don't match the size of the attack could stir up more discontent in Russia (assuming the information gets out to people in Russia which is not guaranteed)


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Which there is already evidence for


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] BHjr132#2979
If they just surround the major cities and ukraine surrenders then Russia gets to win without facing the 10,000 civilians with guns


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] Trask#2574
From what I can tell the mood in Russia is utterly insane right now.


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
They've ordered a general mobilisation


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] Trask#2574
Yeah that means very little.


[25-Feb-22 09:04 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Don't see them surrendering


[25-Feb-22 09:05 AM] Hayley Fitzpatrick#7368
One of my friends in Moscow says that there’s a lot of anti Putin sentiment but people are scared of the police


[25-Feb-22 09:05 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Gregor Prediction is that they'll try and occupy and hold onto Slobozhanshchnya and seize Ukrainian energy generation assets to cripple the nations access to power completely


[25-Feb-22 09:05 AM] BHjr132#2979
If they cut off supplies to the major cities for weeks then the appetite for surrender will change


[25-Feb-22 09:05 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
They won't annex Slobozhanshchnya though they'll just try and occupy it with soldiers and claim a victory through it


[25-Feb-22 09:05 AM] Trask#2574
It can't drag on that long


[25-Feb-22 09:05 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It could!


[25-Feb-22 09:05 AM] Trask#2574
Also that's a war crime. Kind of undermines Putin's whole argument


[25-Feb-22 09:06 AM] BHjr132#2979
I don't think Putin really cares about war crimes


[25-Feb-22 09:06 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I mean he's already targeting civilian centers so I don't think he really cares lmao


[25-Feb-22 09:06 AM] Trask#2574
He cares about the appearance of war crimes. Or he wouldn't have provided a defence against charges of the Crime of Aggression in his speech yesterday.


[25-Feb-22 09:07 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Gregor Prediction is already coming true because we can see the concentration of attacks and actual measures to hold ground being targeted at the energy production of Ukraine


[25-Feb-22 09:07 AM] Trask#2574
I don't think anybody has been successfully charged under that clause unless they like, bombed civilian hospitals on purpose


[25-Feb-22 09:08 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
He's taken one of Ukraines NPPs and there is bombing in Dnipro and Zaporozizhia and a push to go North from Crimea allegedly. They could very well be going for the NPP in Enerhodar and the hydroelectric systems on the Dnieper

Because Ukraine has such a massively concentrated energy network it would be a sound strategic decision to make and is the path they're seemingly taking


[25-Feb-22 09:09 AM] Trask#2574
They are right to the extent that maintenance for the station also relies on the Russians. NASA will need to find a workaround if the sanctions really are that total

[25-Feb-22 09:24 AM] Trask#2574
That essay I posted last night is basically his rationale for the invasion. He fundamentally doesn't see Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians as distinct peoples.


[25-Feb-22 09:26 AM] Trask#2574
So invading Ukraine is like restoring order to a wayward Russian province. He doesn't see them as non-Russian and considers their nationalism to represent a fundamental rejection of their own heritage, history, and culture.


[25-Feb-22 09:27 AM] Trask#2574
He talks about how he thinks the Ukrainian nation state cannot exist as a project any longer unless it is Neo-Nazi (because of national hero's like Bandera, ect) and anti-Russian.

Audio reportedly from Snake Island:

(RUS): This is a Russian warship. I suggest you lay down your arms and surrender to avoid bloodshed. Otherwise we will open fire on you. 

(UKR): Russian warship, go fuck yourself. 

All Ukrainian soldiers were killed. https://t.co/10tCHAhmma

Yea that part was a pretty weird move by Putin ngl


[25-Feb-22 10:44 AM] boomfa#6923
It’s too early to tell really but I’d guess the land-based warfare is a lot more even handed than people are thinking


[25-Feb-22 10:45 AM] boomfa#6923
Ukrainian troops are infinitely more motivated than the Russians and the disparity in equipment (based on what the Russians have actually deployed) doesn’t seem that insurmountable


[25-Feb-22 10:46 AM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Ukraine is holding up well ngl


[25-Feb-22 10:46 AM] boomfa#6923
Of course there’s probably going to be an escalation but if they can stabilise the situation and set up better defensive lines in the north and south

it's about 100km of north of Kyiv


[25-Feb-22 11:24 AM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
the original plan was to build Chernobyl Power Plant about 20km away from Kyiv's city centre btw


[25-Feb-22 11:24 AM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849

We have only seen the opening phase of #Putin’s barbaric plan,but it has been more difficult than he expected

There are now indications #Kyiv may soon be the focus of his rage, and then the entire world would come face to face with a depravity not seen in 80 years

And it’s marshes lead on to the Kyiv reservoir


[25-Feb-22 12:04 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
yeah obviously but I saw a tweet saying they had a plan for it


[25-Feb-22 12:05 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
to use it for staging or something


[25-Feb-22 12:05 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
but I can't find the tweet


[25-Feb-22 12:05 PM] boomfa#6923
I suppose because it can’t be a target for artillery/rocket strikes


[25-Feb-22 12:05 PM] boomfa#6923
But like


[25-Feb-22 12:05 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
yeah that was my thought


[25-Feb-22 12:05 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
they can't bomb it...


[25-Feb-22 12:06 PM] boomfa#6923
It’s so close to the Belarusian border where they already had staging grounds lmao


[25-Feb-22 12:06 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
yeah that too


[25-Feb-22 12:06 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
so I think that tweet was inaccurate


[25-Feb-22 12:06 PM] boomfa#6923
There is a lot of fake shit going around unsurprisingly


[25-Feb-22 12:06 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
still a possibility they'll use it for staging and then say it can't be attacked due to the radioactivity concerns

Russian T80s, BMPS and BRDMs approach the gates of Kyiv. President Zelenskyy looks on in horror at the Russian onslaught as enemy Mi24s strafe Ukrainian positions and Spetsnaz skewer Ukrainian babies on their bayonets. The Ghost of Kyiv is long dead, destroyed by Russian SAM positions surrounding the city. Ukraine is alone and destined for destruction. 

A Russian MiG-29 maneuverers for a bombing run directly at the Presidential Palace while Zelenskyy, resigned to his fate, watches wistfully through a bay window as it lines up on him. Suddenly, a loud sonic boom is heard before two sidewinder missiles slam into the MiG. A F35 zooms past and the pilot salutes. "I got ya, jack. Malarkey terminated. He ain't got nothing on Corn Pop." President Biden flies off into the sunset. Zelenskyy salutes in return, tears in his eyes. "Slava Ukraine..."

[25-Feb-22 03:28 PM] Trask#2574
Ukraine was consciously offered up by NATO, its not like this had to happen. They also could have accepted any of the compromises proposed by the Russians and Separatists and chose not to. They refused any compromise on the premise that their sovereignty would be backed by NATO and the US and when it was clear that that was never going to happen it was already all over

Facebook Allows Praise of Neo-Nazi Ukrainian Battalion If It Fights...
The reversal raises questions about Facebook’s blacklist-based content moderation, which critics say lacks nuance and context.

as of twelve hours ago they are still alive.


[25-Feb-22 03:51 PM] Trask#2574
```According to internal policy materials reviewed by The Intercept, Facebook will “allow praise of the Azov Battalion when explicitly and exclusively praising their role in defending Ukraine OR their role as part of the Ukraine’s National Guard.” Internally published examples of speech that Facebook now deems acceptable include “Azov movement volunteers are real heroes, they are a much needed support to our national guard”; “We are under attack. Azov has been courageously defending our town for the last 6 hours”; and “I think Azov is playing a patriotic role during this crisis.”

This technically doesn't actually confirm if they are still alive though.

The Japanese ambassador to Ukraine stayed in Kiev.

His great-grandfather's samurai sword and traditional armor was delivered to him from Tokyo, Japan. 

In a FB post, he declared that the samurai must protect the country in which he is!

> On 6 March 2009 in Geneva, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a red button with the English word "reset" and the Roman alphabet transliteration of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet word перегрузка ("peregruzka"). It was intended that this would be the Russian word for "reset" but actually was the word for "overcharged".

If you think a nuclear bomb has gone off near you, STAY INDOORS for at least a week, even if you can't get in touch with loved ones or emergency services. You should stay away from windows and shelter in the rooms deepest within your house or wherever you are holing up. Keep some cans of food and water sufficient enough for this period. Do not go outside looking for friends, family, or help. This is the first in a series of helpful Trask info posts to help you all prepare for the limited nuclear exchange that will take place later this month.

Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar:
"The Russian military seized two vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, changed into the uniform of the Ukrainian military and moved at high speed to the center of Kyiv. They are followed by a column of Russian military trucks."

Tochka-U should have been a priority target for Russian strikes in the very beginning of its operation. I'm not sure how many, if any were destroyed, but if they are still operational and hitting Russian airfields this would be quite embarrassing for the GRU/GU and MoD.

Or leave Russia


[25-Feb-22 06:26 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Russian people live in a dictatorship, therefore they are very limited in how they can say “stop”. If they tell the government to “stop” or leave Russia, they can get put in prison, or murdered by police.


[25-Feb-22 06:26 PM] BHjr132#2979
Cam is correct here, the alternative to Russians suffering is Ukrainians suffering

The weird thing is Australia is actually in a good position to do that. Use the ADGSM to stop exports to Russia, and use other methods to reduce imports.

If Russia want to nuke us then they can do it, we’ll just nuke them back and no one wins


[25-Feb-22 06:44 PM] BHjr132#2979
I doubt even Putin could get his generals to sign off on their own suicides by declaring war on NATO over sanctions

Jefferson Earl (Macnamara) disendorsed by UAP.  I believe he's the first candidate announced then disendorsed by any party.

Amusing given Craig Kelly endorsed Simeon Boikov for Strathfield (which for *still* unexplained reasons Boikov wasn't actually on the ballot for).

Like, there's a good chance your money will go to arming Nazis


[25-Feb-22 07:28 PM] Cam T#6441
Which can happen. If Russia goes away


[25-Feb-22 07:28 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Perhaps if you want to support Ukrainians don't donate to literal armies!!!

[25-Feb-22 07:33 PM] дётrivøre#5054
The issue with pointing out that Russia has Nazis and is corrupt (it does and is) is that nobody’s calling for us to send military aid to Russia or donate money to the Russian armed forces — they are calling to do those things towards Ukraine, so its corruption and ties to Nazis are more relevant

The IOC also literally does not get involved in things


[25-Feb-22 07:38 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860

I don’t think it’s selfish to say that I don’t want to be involved in a global war, I don’t want to be enlisted into the military to defend Australia, and I don’t want Russia invading more innocent countries in Europe. 

These sanctions are truly almost at the very most we can do. Anything further is dangerous and risks the lives of everyone, not just people in Ukraine.


[25-Feb-22 07:45 PM] mikiboss#2416
I am still surprised that we didn't expel the diplomats. Like I don't feel *super* strongly about it myself, but the Government has done that quite a bit before.

BREAKING: Reports of gunfire in the government quarter of Kyiv
Twitter


[25-Feb-22 07:48 PM] Cam T#6441
And mad threats to everyone.


[25-Feb-22 07:48 PM] mikiboss#2416
Like I'd be fine with keeping the ambassador personally, but I'm just surprised they seemed to rule it out


[25-Feb-22 07:48 PM] Cam T#6441
Why keep them.


[25-Feb-22 07:48 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Anyway, I continue with my line that I don’t want further war in Europe and I don’t want a global war


[25-Feb-22 07:48 PM] kyōsantō#0087
We need to minimise the risk of this


[25-Feb-22 07:48 PM] Cam T#6441
Then Russia should stop


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] Cam T#6441
The answer is very easy. Russia needs to stop.


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Obviously intelligence says it’s more likely than not that this could happen which is why we are trying not to go too hard


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] Cam T#6441
It is war.


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] Cam T#6441
Ppl r dead.


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] Cam T#6441
Go hard.


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Personally I think we should intern all the Russians until Putin stops


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] дётrivøre#5054
This exactly. People keep making comparisons to Hitler (which Putin obviously isn’t), and it worries me, because once they get in that warring mindset, civil liberties and personal freedoms get eroded.


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
We need to send a message


[25-Feb-22 07:49 PM] mikiboss#2416
I *personally* think that a point of communication is still manageable for administrative purposes, but I concede that I'm not like a hardliner on it. For me, it's a real 'he can stay, or he can go' kinda thing.


[25-Feb-22 07:50 PM] kyōsantō#0087
It is a war between Russia and Ukraine, I don’t want it to be a war between Russia, and their allies, and everyone else in the world


[25-Feb-22 07:50 PM] Cam T#6441
I don’t get why he should stay


[25-Feb-22 07:50 PM] Cam T#6441
He hasn’t made Russia stop


[25-Feb-22 07:50 PM] Cam T#6441
So he can go


[25-Feb-22 07:50 PM] BHjr132#2979
Here’s where liveuamap says Russia is up to in the suburbs of Kyiv

[25-Feb-22 07:51 PM] BHjr132#2979
Putin has literally said, and I quote, “I never think about Australia”. Why would he listen to us even if he had an ambassador here


[25-Feb-22 07:51 PM] Cam T#6441
Correct


[25-Feb-22 07:51 PM] mikiboss#2416
that is true lol


[25-Feb-22 07:51 PM] rattt#1312
I find it silly that no one can see what cam posts and be like, yes this is a real person


[25-Feb-22 07:51 PM] Cam T#6441
I don’t think ur silly.


[25-Feb-22 07:51 PM] Cam T#6441
Rude, yes.


[25-Feb-22 07:51 PM] Cam T#6441
Silly no.


[25-Feb-22 07:51 PM] kyōsantō#0087
I’d rather we didn’t see ballistic missiles raining down on Warsaw or Talinn. We should be doing everything to prevent this, and we are. At the end of the day, the world has decided to sacrifice once country to save the rest.


[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Is that wrong? Maybe.


[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] Cam T#6441
Yes. It is wrong.


[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
These are excessively childish and simplistic takes, which makes sense coming from a child


[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] Cam T#6441
Selfish and wrong mostly.


[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] kyōsantō#0087
But this is foreign policy with crazed men, not playground tiggy


[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] BHjr132#2979
Eh I don’t think the world has decided that, it sort of just happened as we all twiddled our thumbs


[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] rattt#1312

[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] Cam T#6441

[25-Feb-22 07:52 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860

[25-Feb-22 07:53 PM] rattt#1312

[25-Feb-22 07:54 PM] Cam T#6441
That is y I sent the Insta


[25-Feb-22 07:54 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Okay, so hypothetically let’s say that Australia needs to DM Russia still, we need to ensure that we can be involved in the peace process when it happens, the Ambassador is the one who can send the message. 

Just like your message, it still might not do anything, but it’s important to still send the message.


[25-Feb-22 07:54 PM] Cam T#6441
What is ur problem.


[25-Feb-22 07:54 PM] BHjr132#2979

This is just awfully depressing and honestly I can’t help but feel a bit defeatist about it.


[25-Feb-22 07:55 PM] BHjr132#2979
Based, the most violent my Twitter feed used to get was posts about cars trying to run over cyclists


[25-Feb-22 07:55 PM] Cam T#6441

[25-Feb-22 07:55 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

[25-Feb-22 07:55 PM] Cam T#6441
@rattt so it’s just a joke?


[25-Feb-22 07:56 PM] Cam T#6441
I don’t really get y u say that as the joke


[25-Feb-22 07:56 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Like honestly we’re watching a western country fall in real time and nothing is overly being done. The same could happen to any country. How can one not feel defeatist about this?


[25-Feb-22 07:57 PM] rattt#1312
ehhh its ukraine, PRIVYET COMRADES

[25-Feb-22 07:57 PM] дётrivøre#5054
If Russia really has surrounded, taken, and/or infiltrated most Ukrainian cities, now would be a good time for a surrender, to avoid urban combat and massive loss of life

Look I'm just going to make this a statement here. I know that both of you don't get on well at the best of times, and I'd rather not continue this, but I can't really deal with this being a discussion here in the open where it can spill out. I get that to some this is an easy chat, but I don't want this here as a discussion. If you want to have a discussion about this matter, do so further in DMs.

Yea Ukraine officially dies in a few hours but the resistance will be long and brutal

SBS suspends Russian TV news broadcasts

SBS usually broadcasts the news bulletins of NTV Moscow and Russia Today as part of its international news programming. 

The broadcaster has announced it has suspended the broadcast of those Russian news bulletins "in response to community feedback from the Australian Russian-speaking community."

"SBS is continuing to provide news and information in Russian for Australian audiences through its SBS Russian service across radio, online and social media, including expanded coverage of current events as they unfold," the statement said.

Battle of Chernobyl
The Battle of Chernobyl was a military confrontation in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone between the Russian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian Armed Forces, starting on 24 February 2022, during the first day of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian forces, who invaded from the territory of Belarus, seized the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant area ...

[25-Feb-22 09:27 PM] doctor#0002
what does that even mean


[25-Feb-22 09:27 PM] doctor#0002
they will surrender and be absorbed into russia


[25-Feb-22 09:27 PM] doctor#0002
what does it matter if they're neutral


[25-Feb-22 09:29 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
YES


[25-Feb-22 09:30 PM] BHjr132#2979
If they surrender now they will also have a lot of leverage


[25-Feb-22 09:30 PM] BHjr132#2979
Russia will be scared of the civilian resistance so they will want to get the occupation over with quick


[25-Feb-22 09:34 PM] doctor#0002
how will they have any leverage if they surrender


[25-Feb-22 09:34 PM] doctor#0002
do you understand what surrender means


[25-Feb-22 09:34 PM] Trask#2574
The only factor now is how many more people are going to die


[25-Feb-22 09:34 PM] Trask#2574

what terms are there to be negotiated


[25-Feb-22 09:36 PM] showstealer1829#6775
Something where they live


[25-Feb-22 09:37 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Russia is obviously not occupying because they’re primarily focusing on Kyiv


[25-Feb-22 09:37 PM] BHjr132#2979
Putin knows he will rapidly lose support when the young Russian men return home in body bags so he can’t occupy the country long term, so Ukraine has leverage in that Putin needs post-war negotiations over quick


[25-Feb-22 09:38 PM] showstealer1829#6775
Also that, he can only hide soldiers deaths for so long before the number becomes too large to hide


[25-Feb-22 09:38 PM] Trask#2574
Unconditional surrender


[25-Feb-22 09:38 PM] doctor#0002
not sure putin really gives a shit about his own soldiers dying


[25-Feb-22 09:39 PM] Trask#2574
I think people are generally massively overestimating the Russian popular mood right now. From all accounts I've seen there is intense revanchist sentiment


[25-Feb-22 09:39 PM] showstealer1829#6775
Honestly if Ukraine just offered to give up Donbas and Luhansk and never join NATO to Putin, he probably takes it.


[25-Feb-22 09:40 PM] Trask#2574
People played up those protests yesterday but they really were quite tiny. People love to say how "scary" it is to protest in Russia and how "brave" they were to do it but those numbers were way way way below what even a regular opposition protest turns out


[25-Feb-22 09:42 PM] Trask#2574
Think maybe just maybe it's a possibility that Putin has gotten away with his authoritarian model because he's tapping into a genuinely held nationalist/revanchist sentiment that grew up in response to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the social catastrophe that followed


[25-Feb-22 09:42 PM] BHjr132#2979
I don’t deny Putin is popular in Russia


[25-Feb-22 09:45 PM] Trask#2574
I think it sits better with people if Putin is an unpopular dictator who is acting alone, not the avatar of an insane ultranationalist mood that has been bubbling up in Russia for decades

WASHINGTON—In an effort to dissuade the Russian leader from invading Ukraine, President Joe Biden reportedly told Vladimir Putin Wednesday, “You know, if I were you, I’d go after Finland.” “Ukraine’s cool and everything, but Finland has, like, an eighth of the people and twice the GDP—it’d be a breeze to annex,…

As I said at the same time, I left that video up because I had literally just seen the clip on the 10 Nightly news. I know that like these types of things are content I don't like being shared, but if it's gonna be on there as the first or second clip, I think that's at least somewhat reasonable. Not good, but I get it.


[26-Feb-22 01:16 AM] Wanuke#5929
> UA soldiers were stopping cars and busses and yanking out any man aged 18-60 to conscript in the Ukrainian Army. In one place, a commissar was shouting “say goodbye to your daughters, mothers, and girlfriends; you must turn back and fight the Russian invader!”

No words for this

Do the Ukrainians expect they’ll get more support by forcing their populace to fight?


[26-Feb-22 01:18 AM] Trask#2574
I think they want to prolong it


[26-Feb-22 01:18 AM] Minato Namikaze#7891
imo they are bascially doing a stalingrad


[26-Feb-22 01:18 AM] дётrivøre#5054
Sending people with no training into the meat grinder is not going to prolong it by much


[26-Feb-22 01:18 AM] Trask#2574
its actually a war crime


[26-Feb-22 01:18 AM] дётrivøre#5054
They’ll just take worse casualties


[26-Feb-22 01:18 AM] Trask#2574
though they can technically get away with it by calling it conscription


[26-Feb-22 01:19 AM] дётrivøre#5054
I still don’t get why Ukrainians weren’t GTFOing en masse for the past three weeks


[26-Feb-22 01:19 AM] Minato Namikaze#7891
also to the aussie here we still can have force conscription


[26-Feb-22 01:19 AM] Minato Namikaze#7891
but


[26-Feb-22 01:19 AM] Trask#2574
I think at this point, and I dont like this term much but its clearly happening, they are using human shield tactics.


[26-Feb-22 01:19 AM] Minato Namikaze#7891
its only for home defence


[26-Feb-22 01:20 AM] Minato Namikaze#7891
its bascially what the USSR did in ww2


[26-Feb-22 01:20 AM] Trask#2574
If they fill every location with lots of conscripts who blur the line between civilian and soldier and then they die under Russian attack, that can be used to make a case to the West.


[26-Feb-22 01:20 AM] дётrivøre#5054
The USSR cleared minefields with soldiers, not an admirable example


[26-Feb-22 01:20 AM] Trask#2574

also Germany hasnt sent ukraine anything


[26-Feb-22 01:22 AM] Trask#2574
Some people will want this to devolve into a brutal sectarian war because thats the only way some kind of independent Ukranian (in the Western Ukranian nationalist sense) state ever establishes itself.

Absolutely agree

They were already sacrificed years ago when the West decided not to accept their pleas for entrance into the EU and NATO and encouraged them down the path of non-compromise with the Russians and Separatists. They have been systematically set up for failure.


[26-Feb-22 01:29 AM] doctor#0002

NATO Won’t Let Ukraine Join Soon. Here’s Why.
Ukraine, with Russian troops on its borders, is pressing for membership. But President Biden and European leaders are not ready for that step.

To clarify. There will almost certainly be POW camps and other horrific shit. But they are not going to systematically kill millions of Ukranians.

[26-Feb-22 01:32 AM] Trask#2574
The Russian mentality is that Ukranians are Russians. They will probably obliterate their culture and religion, but I dont see how millions of deaths could happen unless this war is still going on 5 years from now.

Satellite Photos Suggest Russia Sent Trained Dolphins To War In Syria
Satellite images of the Russian base at Tartus in late 2018 show marine mammal pens of the type used by the Russian Navy in its trained dolphin, seal and Beluga whale programs. It is likely that dolphins were used in Syria to counter enemy divers who might try to sabotage ships.

I’m not sure why cutting off military invaders from international finance is controversial


[26-Feb-22 10:14 AM] Trask#2574
Because it would tank the world economy and raise gas prices up the wazoo

No it wasn't. The US State Department lied to Saddam Hussain and told him the invasion had the green light and then immediately turned around and attacked him. The sanctions they imposed on Iraq afterwards economically destroyed the country and directly killed 500,000 children due to malnutrition.

In the South China Sea, they just built a bunch of islands. This is because the noble Oriental has the impulse to create, and the Yankee Barbarian has only the impulse to destroy — as he did in Iraq, Afghanistan, and countless others.

Two US officials confirmed that Ukraine shot down a second Il-76 transport aircraft tonight. If true, this would be a really significant mistake for the Russian military, and possibly the worst loss of life for the Russian Airborne Forces since the 2nd Chechen War.

This is the only reason I even put it out as a silly suggestion though. While a very low chance, there is now a greater than 0% chance of Finland joining

I reckon it would be Sweden and Finland joining simultaneously or neither joining (with neither joining as most likely). Both joining as a bit of a joint statement to Russia that they won't be bullied etc

[26-Feb-22 05:27 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Zelensky is an actor/entertainer as well, so rhetoric and bluster (which, tbh, is all Ukraine really has against Russia as it stands) is his strong suit, if I'm making sense


[26-Feb-22 05:27 PM] Youmaton#1190
His reply to the US demanding ammunition instead of a ride was amazing


[26-Feb-22 05:27 PM] Youmaton#1190
I understand that


[26-Feb-22 05:27 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
It might not have seemed obvious at the time but in retrospect if anyone was going to be able to unite the nation and serve as a uniting figure, it was going to be him


[26-Feb-22 05:28 PM] Youmaton#1190

I don't think Zelensky is going to die, but if he does that last clip of him just screaming "NYETTTTTTTTTT" as the last plane departs from an empty airport is going to become the funniest thing ever


[26-Feb-22 05:33 PM] BHjr132#2979
Walking around Kyiv with a megaphone to motivate his people is prob what Zelensky is doing rn

[26-Feb-22 06:09 PM] mikiboss#2416
Yeah bit like I’ll be honest, I’m surprised at just how much of a unifying figure Zelensky has become, not just in Ukraine, but internationally. I mean I was Meming him only a few days ago, which is why I posted that video. I struggle to think of a compatible figure to him in the last 10 years.

I think he's figured out the 2 best chances for Ukraine to survive.

1. Draw the fighting out causing maximum pain and casualties to the Russians till they decide the cost is too great/public pressure back home forces them to the negotiation table.

2. Frustrate the Russian advance forcing them to become more indiscriminate with their shelling/missiles etc which starts leading to massive civilian casualties to the point that the rest of the world can't stand by any longer. He's probably hoping for at least some kind of air campaign in that scenario to take out the Russian artillery


[26-Feb-22 06:35 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I doubt they are going to be enforcing that anytime soon

Every time I see photos of Ukraine’s President Zelensky fighting alongside his fellow Ukrainians in the streets, I think of our Prime Minister running away to loaf in a chair in Hawaii during the bushfires while Australia burned and his fellow Australians died.

THREAD 1/7 Intel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin’s lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days. @EPPGroup @general_ben @edwardlucas @politico https://t.co/8AoelUDWM9

I thank my friend Mr. President of 🇹🇷 @RTErdogan and the people of 🇹🇷 for their strong support. The ban on the passage of 🇷🇺 warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for 🇺🇦 are extremely important today. The people of 🇺🇦 will never forget that!

I have no stake in either side "winning." I hope that there is a negotiated settlement sometime soon that avoids further loss of life and sees Luhansk, Donetsk, and Crimea formally ceded to Russia so this nightmare can finally end for good.

It will be interesting to see how that goes, as Putin did say sanctions like this would be an act of war

Russia blew up an oil terminal in Kyiv with a missile, this will be a huge environmental and health disaster

I was not expecting the EU to go that far

Even with the swift ban, they've someone convinced Hungary and Germany to agree on something


[27-Feb-22 11:00 AM] Youmaton#1190
*and* to get Germany to donate weapons


[27-Feb-22 11:00 AM] Youmaton#1190
That's huge


[27-Feb-22 11:00 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Freezing it means that right now as we speak, the Russian economy is about to go into a crippling recession which people will directly die from alone


[27-Feb-22 11:00 AM] BHjr132#2979
You know you’ve fucked up when even Hungary is doing everything they can to stop you

BP spilt 4.9m barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and nothing much happened :yeahok:


[27-Feb-22 11:00 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Putin Administration has also lost its most effective means of control of their economy


[27-Feb-22 11:01 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
And a decrease in overall Budgetary revenue and an increase in expenditure means that the Russian economy could very well just straight up collapse

This will effect the Federal Subjects way more as well which is another key concern


[27-Feb-22 11:01 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Consider an area like Tatarstan


[27-Feb-22 11:02 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The economy of it is heavily dependent on their export industry and the people enjoy a higher standard of living than the rest of Russia cause of it

No one should be celebrating the SWIFT decision or the freezing of the Russian Central Bank assets. It's a victory against the Putin Administration but it means people will be hurt, it means people will struggle economically and it means people will die

Imagine if Gorbachev came out and publicly denounced the invasion


[27-Feb-22 11:08 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Their actual trading options overseas are reduced dramatically and their markets have massive choice restrictions which leads to a major price decrease for what they're likely to get


[27-Feb-22 11:08 AM] BHjr132#2979
But now the billionaires just lost everything because of Putin’s ego project in Ukraine


[27-Feb-22 11:08 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Additionally the Russian import market will struggle and they can't make up the shortfalls alone at markets which will still trade with them

[27-Feb-22 11:36 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
I assumed most of our imported oil came from OPEC


[27-Feb-22 11:36 AM] NGSpy#8096
true, I'd like for there to be a transition to it


[27-Feb-22 11:36 AM] NGSpy#8096
to no oil


[27-Feb-22 11:36 AM] NGSpy#8096
and it to just be AUSTRALIAN OIL


[27-Feb-22 11:36 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Australian oil companies would hate that


[27-Feb-22 11:37 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Because it means they couldn't sell their oil at inflated global prices


[27-Feb-22 11:37 AM] NGSpy#8096
well they can suck a dick


[27-Feb-22 11:37 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Well yes


[27-Feb-22 11:37 AM] MR AWESOME#2496

Ugh, that’s a tough one actually. Because I think we can say rhetorically what we do/don’t mean by ‘active’ wars, because obviously it doesn’t cover everything. I’m gonna interpret it as being footage is allowed, but footage which shows obvious or at least presumed death would be gone.

⚡️Ukraine's State Emergency Service has clarified that the shelling on a radioactive waste disposal site in Kyiv did not lead to depressurization of the storage of radioactive substances. 

The hit was on the fence and the building itself and the tanks remain intact.

Okay let's get one thing straight. There is no scenario in which they "win" this war without using weapons of mass destruction or triggering WW3. Easily the most undesirable of all the possible outcomes here.

At an absolute minimum 39% of Russia's Central Bank reserves ($630bn) appear to have been frozen.

If Japan does the same will take it up to half.

But my actual prediction was that Russia would invade and win but face a lot more resistance than expected and it would take a long time and occur in stages, giving the Ukraine government chances to surrender in between waves

[27-Feb-22 01:47 PM] Trask#2574
Ukrainians have a right to independence and sovereignty, but the separatists also have a right to self determination. You can't pick and choose democratic principles when it suits you. Yes Russia attacked Ukraine, but this whole situation has been generated by a political and diplomatic impasse that came about when the Ukrainian government failed to come up with any other solution to the separatists in Donbas other than 1) attacking them, and 2) waiting around for something to happen. Federalisation of the country, special status for Donetsk and Luhansk, and cession of portions of the regions to Russia were all serious proposals that were dismissed because the Ukrainians believed inaccurately that their position was being backed by the West.


[27-Feb-22 01:48 PM] Youmaton#1190
I support self determination. If there were an independent referendum that found that they did want to become their own nation, free from influence of any other nation, then I would agree that they should be free

There were two candidates. Poroshenko was the most Ukranian nationalist of the two! Of course the easterners voted against him in the second round. If you look at the first round results the easterners voted largely for Yuriy Boyko, who wants to come to a compromise with Russia.

```Zelenskiy has avoided such scandals, but deep concerns remain over his links to oligarch Ihor Kolomoiskiy, whose 1+1 television channel broadcasts the challenger’s comedy shows while lambasting Poroshenko – who now plans to sue the station over a string of lurid and unsubstantiated claims.

This week, 1+1 will launch a new series of Sluga Narodu (Servant of the People), in which Zelenskiy plays a teacher pitched into the role of president.

Then on Saturday, a “day of silence” when campaigning is banned, the station has scheduled several shows featuring Zelenskiy, including a particularly timely documentary in which he narrates the life story of Ronald Reagan – the actor who became US president.```

News you won't read. On Thursday, Putin reportedly offered peace if Ukraine embraced neutrality and rejected Nato's arms. Ukraine's president Zelensky was elected in 2019 largely by ethnic Russians on a platform to make peace with Russia.

No. It should not be controversial to say he was popular in the East and unpopular in the West though. You can recognise he was a horrific tyrant who the people of Kiev were right to topple while at the same time recognising that his overthrow generated intense anxiety and anger amongst people in the East of the country that exploded into armed conflict.

I don't have a complete belief in total self determination for national bodies mainly from a perspective of practicality or the kind of movement which it would create internally for those living in the area which is why I am opposed to the cession of Donbass. Additionally, it is undeniable that the Seperatist Movement in these regions wasn't genuinely started in opposition to any actual slight or attack directly on the people but was spawned through artificial means by Russian backing in the region


[27-Feb-22 02:41 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
From a practical standpoint I believe the evidence supports Donbass being better under a Ukranian corrupt democracy than an authoritarian capitalist state of total autonomy for Oligarchial classes


[27-Feb-22 02:42 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
And the Seperatist Movement for these regions is rather artificial in terms of the sudden escalation to the need for war as prior to 2014 it was incredibly niche as a movement and wasn't really a major issue during the independence process

It happened directly after Euromaidan. The government they supported and which they were told would deliver them federalisation and protection of their faith and language was overthrown in what was essentially just a series of violent riots (which we call a revolution afterwards because they succeeded). Don't see how that is artificial in the slightest.


[27-Feb-22 02:44 PM] Trask#2574
Whether or not the Russians goaded them on is immaterial. Its a matter of basic democratic principles. A people should be able to separate themselves from a country if they so choose. Whether its good for them or not in the long-term is also totally immaterial.


[27-Feb-22 02:45 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The issue is that these movements came immediately after the Russian annexation of Crimea and that inability to federalize Ukraine further doesn't seem like something which would instantly spawn a terrorist movement, as that is what those in charge of the DPR and LPR undeniably are due to their methods of attack and attack on third parties during the Donbass War


[27-Feb-22 02:45 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
Dude doc is taking the fuck W for rhis


[27-Feb-22 02:45 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm not from these regions and don't wish to sound like I'm speaking for their perspective here I just find it hard to believe it is fully natural for a lack of direct federalization support under a popular revolution would instantly spawn a violent movement in a region with little history of violent secessionist rhetoric


[27-Feb-22 02:46 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Without foreign intervention of some form


[27-Feb-22 02:46 PM] Trask#2574
There's that word again. Its very easy to just throw it in there and then pretend like the group you have assigned it to can be disregarded and ignored. The Ukranians also called them terrorists and refused to consider their demands for autonomy and federalisation. And where did that get us all?


[27-Feb-22 02:49 PM] Trask#2574
Do you remember Maidan? There were armed militias, half of them hardcore Ukranian nationalists, fighting the cops with guns every day on the streets of Kiev and occupying government buildings. The city was a war zone. I think that communicated to the Easterners pretty clearly that all bets were off.

It's clearly a fault of those running the DPR and LPR  that diplomatic means weren't continually pursued rather than going from a refusal of demands to what was very much opportune seizure of power within the region


[27-Feb-22 02:52 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
Youma shut up honestly


[27-Feb-22 02:52 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Not universally enough that more of them actually came out to actively fight against the Ukranians though especially along the entirety of the South and East though. Political instability in the capital doesn't mean that it becomes justified to secede without any formalized process under no direct repression or mistreatment


[27-Feb-22 02:53 PM] Trask#2574
There is fault to be placed on both sides. But there wasn't much to negotiate about when the Ukrainian central government informally banned the Russian language, launched military operations against them using militias that repeatedly did well reported war crimes, and categorically dismissed the possibility of the region ever attaining autonomy, federalisation, or any other concessions.

Through violence is never the right way if you are trying to separate from a democratic nation


[27-Feb-22 03:04 PM] Trask#2574
A nation whose democratic government was just overthrown through violence? For better or for worse that is what Maidan was. Doesn't mean they were wrong to do it, but does make the point hypocritical.


[27-Feb-22 03:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
To add onto what Trask is saying there it is clearly right to violently secede from a democratic nation if it is to prevent something like a genocide, religious conflict etc.


[27-Feb-22 03:07 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
So was chatting with a federal MP this morning and without giving away too much, it seems that the casualty figures the Ukrainians are reporting are broadly correct (as in, outside intelligence and other sources can confirm fairly similar numbers)


[27-Feb-22 03:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The issue with the militias in this case is how much can really feasibly be controlled by the Ukranian state at the height of Euromaidan and how much of it was categorically endorsed in the mess of a post Euromaidan Ukraine by the state apparatus. I think undeniably it is right for people to have gotten armed and fought back against Ukranian Nationalist militias attacking their community but an illegal ban on the language which is practically unenforceable doesn't explain such a major uprising with such well organized arms and equipment springing up


[27-Feb-22 03:09 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's something where it very much feels like and still feels like a group of opportunists seeking to secede with the Russian ethnic people's of Donbass going along with it out of a very reluctant support where they might have sympathies for the view but not enough to have gotten armed about it


[27-Feb-22 03:09 PM] Trask#2574
They were almost certainly armed by the Russians. But its also kind of irrelevant. Sure, some people will see it as the main point, but I honestly don't care either way.


[27-Feb-22 03:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yeah my perspective is very much about what kind of people are running this kind of movement, what is their long term goals and would the region likely be better off under their administration due to their actions? I'm not opposed categorically to the idea of the secession from a "must fight" perspective, I am opposed because I feel that the DPR and LPR must be fought as any other terrorist group seizing a chance with foreign backing by a force hostile to the nation they are seceding from


[27-Feb-22 03:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
As much as I hate to draw parallels to them I'd very much reference ISIL and their foundations in this case


[27-Feb-22 03:12 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Except the justification for ISIL was mainly on religious grounds


[27-Feb-22 03:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I guess the best example I can think of is that like if Rotuma wanted to secede from Fiji I wouldn't want to fight to oppose it, merely highlighting the economic and social implications of cession and how I don't really think it's worth it


[27-Feb-22 03:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But if Tonga financed the secessionist movement which was a group of a small number of Rotumans seizing power, I'd want to fight against that


[27-Feb-22 03:24 PM] Trask#2574
I just categorically don't believe in this idea that there are a set of combatants called "terrorists" to which no concessions should ever be afforded and negotiation is impossible.


[27-Feb-22 03:24 PM] Trask#2574

They're being told it's training exercises. They're young guys who have no idea they're in another country, let alone Ukraine


[27-Feb-22 06:08 PM] showstealer1829#6775
Are they expecting Ukraine to show up?


[27-Feb-22 06:09 PM] BHjr132#2979
It’s the Wikipedia map, gets updated pretty regularly


[27-Feb-22 06:10 PM] BHjr132#2979
Ukraine says they want peace but won’t accept a conditionless surrender, so sad


[27-Feb-22 06:10 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
If the reports are true, some of the Russians are being sent in thinking it's routine exercises and not even knowing it's Ukraine. Something like this leads creedence to those stories


[27-Feb-22 06:11 PM] BHjr132#2979

They’ve never actually fought a war since world war 2 and the soldiers don’t care about Ukraine so moral would be terrible


[27-Feb-22 07:46 PM] BHjr132#2979

I think one big difference (to the Chechen wars/Dagestan etc) is that they’re having to exercise restraint whereas in the past they would just level Grozny

A Ukrainian sailor in Mallorca opened the valves & "partially sank" a €7m yacht belonging to the director of Russia's arms exporter. 
After he explained it was in retaliation for Russian missile strikes on Kyiv, a judge released him pending trial. https://t.co/yCYkOEY6Mw https://t.co/aOgwaAxLng

We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin.

see that's the thing, why not just send in your actually trained military?


[28-Feb-22 10:34 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Because either Putin didn't expect this much resistance/ bad Russian military planning or he's keeping them at bay in case someone tries to take on Russia

Why waste your good military on Ukraine when you can just send an unlimited number of boys with guns :emotiguy:


[28-Feb-22 10:35 AM] BloodyChrome#8410
Plus it's a fairly old strategy, send in the novices first to weaken them up and then send in the battle hardened troops to finish them off

say what you will about John Setka, but I think he's one of the only people with a half decent profile in AusPol who would stay if he were in Zelenskyy's situation


[28-Feb-22 11:27 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657

It's just not very often you get someone ordinary who decides to go to politics because they're usually smart enough to know that they're going to be constantly surrounded by career politician cunts and it will be hard for them to do anything good for the ordinary people

like it's either that or he comes out like "uh well uh, i reckon uh, you know... he's got a point! there are uh, we've got, bit of a far-right Nazi problem in uh, the Ukraine"

The Battle of Brisbane was a riot between United States military personnel on one side and Australian servicemen and civilians on the other, in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city, on 26 and 27 November 1942, during which time the two nations were allies. By the time the violence had been quelled, one Australian soldier was dead and hundreds of ...

Only an AC since you can only be in one class of the order. Unless the last order put you in a lower class in which case it is a demotion

Funny thing is that the Palestinian Authority hasn’t said a peep about the Ukraine situation, because Russia is generally friendly with them and the PA believe they could be a third party negotiating peace as an alternative to the US


[28-Feb-22 04:17 PM] doctor#0002
> Israel has attempted to maintain good relations with both Russia and Ukraine during the crisis, and has even offered to serve as a mediator. But that fence-sitting has resulted in criticism from both sides and now from the U.S.

This but unironically


[28-Feb-22 04:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I must admit, it is a bit silly to compare the 2 circumstances


[28-Feb-22 04:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
However, it is always important to compare your leader to that of other countries


[28-Feb-22 04:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It ensures that we don't continue to have mediocre leaders running our countries


[28-Feb-22 04:42 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Because mediocracy is not a standard for politicians and should never be accepted as a standard


[28-Feb-22 04:44 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
We've been led to believe that it's somehow normal and acceptable for political leaders to sometimes be bad at their jobs; it's not and I wish people were less apathetic to bad leadership

Only those who place self-validation above the Ukrainians’ interests focus on the right to choose NATO & reject the best outcome: an independent, neutral Ukraine. Ask the people of Austria & Finland who lived with more freedom&democracy during the Cold War than we in NATO Greece!

This is a way bigger deal than others are giving credit for if this is true


[28-Feb-22 06:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I have not heard reports confirming if this is true or not


[28-Feb-22 06:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But if Russia has genuinely taken Zaporozhia NPP that is a massive blow to the Ukranians and fully confirms to me personally that they're pursuing the strategy I suggested


[28-Feb-22 06:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The radioactive situation is not the concern it is entirely what it powers


[28-Feb-22 06:01 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
probs yeah


[28-Feb-22 06:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
For reference Zaporozhia NPP is the 9th largest in the world and the largest in Europe

[28-Feb-22 09:12 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891

[28-Feb-22 09:12 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
like what do you mean


[28-Feb-22 09:12 PM] Youmaton#1190
TLDR: centre-left government now backing over 2% of spending being on defence, actively endorsing sending military aid to ukraine, putting forward a strategy to not be reliant on germany


[28-Feb-22 09:13 PM] Youmaton#1190
russia has half its army in ukraine, and yet ukraine is creating a larger army


[28-Feb-22 09:13 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
ah yea


[28-Feb-22 09:13 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
also Ukraine has something to fight for

[28-Feb-22 09:30 PM] BHjr132#2979
These first peace negotiations will result in nothing imo but next round will have an actual outcome


[28-Feb-22 09:30 PM] BHjr132#2979
Too early to say what that outcome will be but I lean towards Russia giving up and going for some small scale concessions like secession of Crimea and independence for the two breakaway nations


[28-Feb-22 09:33 PM] Youmaton#1190
given ukraine is going for EU membership, i dont know if they can even demand that


[28-Feb-22 09:34 PM] BHjr132#2979
Ukraine getting into the EU would make things interesting but I’m skeptical it’ll actually happen anytime soon


[28-Feb-22 09:35 PM] BHjr132#2979
I think it may just be a part of Ukraine’s strategy to scare Russia into withdrawing during the negotiations


[28-Feb-22 09:35 PM] Youmaton#1190
debate in the eu parliament is happening tonight


[28-Feb-22 09:36 PM] BHjr132#2979
Yea I think they’ll move fast on it until it gets to the more official stages when they’ll start to stall


[28-Feb-22 09:36 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
what could they do for ukraine


[28-Feb-22 09:36 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
also I dont mind the EU

[28-Feb-22 09:37 PM] Lach#1222
Ukraine will almost certainly become a candidate state, but negotiations to actually be admitted into the EU will take a while


[28-Feb-22 09:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
ukraine is apparently applying to have the negotiation stages rushed


[28-Feb-22 09:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
almost certainly to scare russia


[28-Feb-22 09:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
but its still interesting


[28-Feb-22 09:38 PM] BHjr132#2979
Can they actually feasibly fast track it, idk how the eu membership process works


[28-Feb-22 09:38 PM] Youmaton#1190

[28-Feb-22 09:38 PM] Youmaton#1190
its what zelensky was saying


[28-Feb-22 09:39 PM] BHjr132#2979
Zelensky also claims to have killed 6,000 Russian troops


[28-Feb-22 09:39 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
like himself


[28-Feb-22 09:40 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
also does he actually doing anything or is it photo opping


[28-Feb-22 09:40 PM] Youmaton#1190
as in the Ukrainian army


[28-Feb-22 09:40 PM] Lach#1222
in most cases, it usually takes around 2-10 years from being accepted as a candidate state to becoming a member, tho atm 4 of the 5 current candidates have been stuck for over 10 years, Turkey for 22 1/2 years


[28-Feb-22 09:40 PM] Minato Namikaze#7891
like I want to root for him but I am just thinking he go back to somewhere safer


[28-Feb-22 09:40 PM] Lach#1222

Solo Along The Ukrainian-Russian Border ( One Day Before Invasion )
🇺🇦 A week now seems a lifetime ago in terms of the rapidly changing events in Ukraine. I arrived in the country thinking to myself 'Putin isn't mad enough to invade because the Ukrainian people will fight to the death for their country. It will be like Stalingrad.' And yet I was completely wrong to underestimate his insanity. Now as I write this...

[01-Mar-22 08:50 AM] Trask#2574
Interesting


[01-Mar-22 08:51 AM] Trask#2574
No mention of the crime of aggression, seems Putin's little legal gambit with that may have paid off.


[01-Mar-22 08:52 AM] Trask#2574
They will also be forced to investigate the Ukrainian military as well. What happens with a ICC referral like this, both sides are investigated.


[01-Mar-22 08:54 AM] Trask#2574
I doubt they will charge anybody with anything related to cluster munitions and indiscriminate harm to civilians, that seems to just be off the cards after Iraq and Syria.


[01-Mar-22 08:55 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Unless they decide to make a stand on that now for going forward


[01-Mar-22 08:57 AM] Trask#2574
I highly doubt it. Opens them up to huge accusations of bias over their Iraq investigation in particular. US and UK systematically and openly used cluster bomb munitions at places like Fallujah with no legal consequence


[01-Mar-22 08:57 AM] Trask#2574
There may be other things they can focus on anyway, I'm sure the full scope and horror of this war will be clearer in a few weeks


[01-Mar-22 08:58 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
I assume they will be starting with things like the hospitals that have been hit


[01-Mar-22 08:58 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Potentially the reports of Russians wearing Ukrainian uniforms


[01-Mar-22 08:58 AM] Trask#2574
Russia and Ukraine are both not signatories to the Cluster Munitions Convention either, so it's actually not a crime for Russia to just use them in Ukrainian territory.


[01-Mar-22 08:59 AM] Trask#2574
Has a higher burden of proof in terms of specific deliberate actions


[01-Mar-22 09:00 AM] Trask#2574
I wonder if Ukraine did a referral.


[01-Mar-22 09:01 AM] Trask#2574
Yeah that's is definitely a war crime if it can be proven.


[01-Mar-22 09:01 AM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
i fucking love war crimes


[01-Mar-22 09:02 AM] Trask#2574
That's the thing though how many of these can concretely be proven?


[01-Mar-22 09:02 AM] Trask#2574
I wonder how far back they will open up the books as well. Does everything that happened in the Donbas conflict also count?


[01-Mar-22 09:03 AM] Trask#2574
If so very high chance Ukrainian military personnel could be charged by the ICC as well.

Thermobaric weapon
A thermobaric weapon, aerosol bomb, or vacuum bomb is a type of explosive that uses oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. In practice, the blast wave typically produced by such a weapon is of a significantly longer duration than that of a conventional condensed explosive. The fuel–air explosive  is one of the ...

Pronunciation note:

The Ukrainian "Kyiv" is pronounced "KEEV," basically.

Russian is "Key-yev".

So, you stand with Keev/Kyiv, if you're pro-Ukraine.

The Zelenskycult is based on this weird elitist idea that anyone in media doesn't have a real job and that the only leaders are born into it and have always been in politics

i think the reason why there is a zelensky cult in the west is that he's a throwback to an era of politics where leaders led with a vision for a better future instead of micro managers offering bullshit

Swedish PM Magdalena Andersson speaks to the nation tonight:
- Russia’s attack on Ukraine puts all swedes in a new situation. The situation is serious.
- Don’t spread rumours, and not about anything related to our defence.
- the government promises extra funding for defence.

⚡️Earlier, A senior U.S. Defense Department official told reporters during a briefing that “morale is flagging” in some of the Russian units.

```(b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall
be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates
under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control
properly over such subordinates, where:
(i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that
the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;
(ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the
superior; and
(iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to
prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for
investigation and prosecution.```

Ok I feel bad for them, they're not affiliated with the actions of their governments. They're just working hard so they can compete at the biggest athletic event that happens every four years and they've been deprived of this chance.

College backtracks on banning teaching Dostoevsky because he's Russian
The University of Milano-Bicocca in Italy initially told writer Paolo Nori that his course on the novelist was being postponed "to avoid any controversy."

I'd call it around a 1% chance. There is a world where this happens given the right circumstances. I'd call Putin being deposed by oligarchs without civil war at around a 5% chance. I'd go about 10% of an attempt being made to remove him and it failing

Olympic Truce
The Olympic Truce is a tradition originating from ancient Greece that dates back to 776 BC. A "truce" (Ancient Greek: ékécheiria, meaning "laying down of arms") was announced before and during the Olympic Games to ensure the host city state (Elis) was not attacked and athletes and spectators could travel safely to the Games and peacefully return...

Don't now if that's cancel culture but companies being racist for clicks is definitely a thing


[03-Mar-22 09:13 PM] Mostly#5473
Yeah I would argue that's more a symptom of company profit brain and trying to keep with whats "hip" rather than cancel culture


[03-Mar-22 09:13 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I don't think they'd be on the cards yet, but if the situation goes bad enough for Russia (which I do see a real chance due to the economic damage) then they become more possible. So I'm basically think there is around a 25% chance that this turns out really bad for Russia (this can happen even if they win the war)


[03-Mar-22 09:14 PM] Trask#2574
At this point yeah you might be right. I have no idea what is going to happen. Whole thing is a catastrophe for everyone.


[03-Mar-22 09:14 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
A few of the oligarchs have already started distancing themselves a bit from Putin (nothing too crazy yet)

If he forces the Ukranians to sign a peace deal with serious concessions or establishes a puppet regime it will have been worth it for him


[03-Mar-22 09:17 PM] Trask#2574
The Russian economy will scream (though not as much as people think it will) but that will only strengthen his position, just like it did for Saddam


[03-Mar-22 09:17 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Depending on the level of economic damage that occurs to Russia


[03-Mar-22 09:18 PM] NGSpy#8096

The universal experience with sanctions is that they cause immense suffering but dont really weaken the regime politically


[03-Mar-22 09:18 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
It comes back to whether Russians end up blaming the West or blaming Putin


[03-Mar-22 09:18 PM] Trask#2574
Personally punishing them is a sure way to ensure they blame the West.


[03-Mar-22 09:18 PM] Mostly#5473
I think a good bit of public sentiment has turned against Putin

Its what always happens when the US does this


[03-Mar-22 09:19 PM] Mostly#5473
Making all the rhetoric leading up to the invasion be "we won't invade don't worry about it" and then invading has really made people feel as if they have been lied to


[03-Mar-22 09:20 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
And it is potentially members of the military and intelligence agencies that are feeling this as well


[03-Mar-22 09:20 PM] Trask#2574
Im not convinced of this tbh. People say this a lot because the idea of Russians opposing Putin sounds nice but I've yet to see any real evidence that public sentiment is against him. Those protests everyone was touting were pitiful even by Russian standards.


[03-Mar-22 09:21 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
If this is true (not fully convinced it is), then it does indicate that Putin has some issues

If there were like, mass demonstrations happening nonstop in Moscow, sure, I would believe you. That would indicate the government was under threat. But its just not happening. Huge demonstrations have taken place historically against regimes a lot more authoritarian and repressive than Putin's

Also a bad sign that Zelensky replaced civilian governor of Odessa with Maxym Marchenko, ex-commander of the far-right Aidar Battalion, subject of an Amnesty war crimes report in 2014. 
This war is a godsend for ghouls everywhere.

President Zelensky this morning said foreign fighters have begun to arrive in Ukraine to help battle the Russians. “Ukraine is already greeting foreign volunteers. (The) first 16,000 are already on their way to protect freedom and life for us, and for all,” he said.

Center for Defense Strategies: Russia will likely impose martial law on March 4. 

The Ukrainian think tank also expects no progress in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. Imposing martial law will let Russian authorities prevent possible mass anti-war protests.

Yeah I do agree but since they do have operational nuclear and their entire country is reliant on it I don't think it should be expected that they shut down their energy supply because of an attack by Russia which could be detrimental. The attack of Ukraines NPP's is as much a threat as Russia deploying nuclear weaponry. Shouldn't happen unless there was a serious attempt to escalate the war in a negative direction.

I dont think either side is trying to blow the thing up


[04-Mar-22 02:17 PM] Trask#2574
They may do so by accident though.


[04-Mar-22 02:17 PM] Trask#2574
They shouldn't be fighting near it.


[04-Mar-22 02:18 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Agreed


[04-Mar-22 02:18 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But it's Russia who is seeing it as a strategic resource to seize and for good reason


[04-Mar-22 02:18 PM] Perekai#6805
They shouldn't be fighting near it, but Ukraine doesn't really have an option in leaving it undefended and letting the Russians capture it.


[04-Mar-22 02:18 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Since prior to the invasion I've talked about how seizing the NPPs is likely to be apart of the Russian strategy


[04-Mar-22 02:18 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and I've been proven right 😌


[04-Mar-22 02:18 PM] Trask#2574
Well that is an option.


[04-Mar-22 02:19 PM] Perekai#6805
It is, but letting the Russians control their energy grid isn't particularly ideal. Neither is letting it be shelled, to be honest. So I'm not sure what the solution is here.


[04-Mar-22 02:20 PM] Trask#2574
A negotiated settlement.


[04-Mar-22 02:20 PM] Trask#2574
Ukraine has to be willing to give up Crimea and Donbas though, so I doubt it will happen.


[04-Mar-22 02:21 PM] Perekai#6805
Nah probably won't happen. Ukraine is probably confident that whatever happens to the nuclear plant, the blame for a failure would be laid onto the Russians.


[04-Mar-22 02:22 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Blame won’t save the people of the oblast


[04-Mar-22 02:22 PM] Trask#2574
If there is a failure there will be no more Ukranians


[04-Mar-22 02:22 PM] Perekai#6805
I don't know what your point is but that is certainly a truism.


[04-Mar-22 02:22 PM] Trask#2574
So its kind of an insane point.


[04-Mar-22 02:23 PM] Trask#2574
Sure people might blame the Russians but also millions of Russians will die


[04-Mar-22 02:23 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Hence the principle of MAD which exists surrounding NPPs


[04-Mar-22 02:24 PM] Trask#2574
Nobody is going to care about this stupid fucking war if there is a massive radiation spill that leaves most of Eastern European uninhabitable for hundreds of years.


[04-Mar-22 02:24 PM] Perekai#6805
Oh I know. I'm not making some sort of point.


[04-Mar-22 02:25 PM] Perekai#6805
Nothing anyone has said on this point is wrong or I disagree with.


[04-Mar-22 02:25 PM] Trask#2574
I think in the end Putin's objective of reinstalling a friendly government in Ukraine makes peace talks kind of impossible. Thats what "denazification" seems to be code for.


[04-Mar-22 02:27 PM] Trask#2574
I would like to think he would be willing to compromise on certain things but I dont see it happening.

> The confinement chambers of a nuclear reactor are built to withstand heavy impact and even bombing, while the VVER pressurised water reactor itself is designed to shut down in an emergency. VVER reactors are considered much safer than the type of reactor that blew up in Chernobyl in 1986, for example.
> 
> But nuclear safety experts warned that any interruption to the power supply that affects the cooling system could start a chain of events that could lead to disaster, as could a direct hit on the spent fuel pools which are not as well protected as the reactors.
> 
> “If the building is not damaged and if the reactors entered safe shut down, and have secondary or tertiary cooling systems then there should be little risk. If those conditions are not met, there is a significant risk,” Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the national security council, said on Twitter.

There is nothing to stop you from going outside with pants covered in shit. You won't be arrested for it, and you probably won't be punished for it. But people do not do this because it is disgusting and immoral

That is the power of the flexibility of Hinduism and the rigidness of Islam as Hinduism and the Vedas can very easily interpret Brahma as being either a state of being or a singular divine being from which all is derived


[04-Mar-22 07:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I choose the latter approach and believe that Allah can use the name and loves the name Brahma

I like Jefferson, Madison, and Cleveland because they opposed centralization and authoritarianism from the start. Madison basically wrote the Bill of Rights, and he was probably the best president we’ve had in terms of respecting the Constitution. Cleveland had a very strong sense of personal integrity, and he applied that when he opposed the annexation of Hawaii.

Why the far-left and far-right can’t resist Putin
Some back the Russian President to express their discontent with the West. Others admire his macho persona. Both extremes gravitate towards authoritarianism.

All the media here is completely braindead, i.e., calling Russia Communist and talking about how this matters because Ukraine is developed and European


[05-Mar-22 04:46 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
At this point it seems that a lot of people have just substituted authoritarian for communist and so when authoritarian isn't there as an option, they see communist as the closest thing. Without having much knowledge of the economic structure within Russia, I'd be assuming it is an authoritarian capitalist state

Sky News team's harrowing account of their violent ambush in Ukrain...
On Monday, near Kyiv, chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay and his team were attacked. Camera operator Richie Mockler took two rounds to his body armour, Stuart was wounded. Their experience illustrates the scale of the mayhem and violence as Russia's invasion enters a new and deadlier phase.

Love how the US just absolutely drove the Soviet Union into the ground with an arms race they couldn't afford, funded insane fundamentalists across the globe to attack and kill their soldiers, and then when their country collapsed pressured them into a brutal and catastrophic series of privatisation and austerity programs which killed millions and resulted in a economic and political model that openly incentivised corruption and empowered oligarchs, but then 30 years down the road when this system of authoritarian graft they helped establish starts to go against their interests its "Communism"

Millions of Leftists Are Reposting Kremlin Misinformation by Mistake
A Kremlin-backed media outlet masquerading as a left-wing news source has been racking up likes and shares on its posts about Ukraine.

This article is hilarious because it's just like "okay so nothing that the outlet shared was actually wrong or incorrect, but it's being made by RUSSIA omg!!!"

So basically, Darkpulsar, you're still a retard, and it's still the right going in to the hilt for Putin, while leftists share objectively correct content made by *shudder* THE KREMLIN!!!!!

But no redfish is a propaganda outlet. It does that thing where it doesn't lie but everything it publishes is done in a carefully constructed way to fit the Russian interest

[05-Mar-22 09:29 PM] Trask#2574
Acknowledging basic verifiable facts is not Russia apologia. I know the fact that you cant gleefully denounce Russian war crimes without being called a hypocrite is difficult for you but you are just going to have to get over it.


[05-Mar-22 09:30 PM] Mostly#5473
Denouncing war crimes is bad now?


[05-Mar-22 09:30 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
what is is hypocritical about denouncing russian war crimes


[05-Mar-22 09:30 PM] Trask#2574
Selectively picking and choosing which foreign conflicts you go apoplectic about is hypocritical.

I acknowledge there is a weird thing about people focusing more on Ukraine than other conflicts because of Eurocentrism and all but pointing that out does not give you an excuse to support Russia


[05-Mar-22 09:32 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
just because people are acknowledging the war crimes in ukraine doesnt make them hypocrites


[05-Mar-22 09:32 PM] Trask#2574
Nobody is supporting Russia. This is a fake person you are getting angry about in your head. It certainly isnt people sharing that post, which again, simply states easily verifiable facts.

[05-Mar-22 09:33 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
well if you're constantly calling people hypocrites for denouncing russia then you're essentially supporting them


[05-Mar-22 09:34 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
you for a fact have spent more time attacking people for attacking russia than talking about all other international conflicts combined


[05-Mar-22 09:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the context that that was said was a bit different


[05-Mar-22 09:34 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I'm conflicted because I absolutely think that more attention is being paid to this conflict because it's a European country attacking a European country and there is a lot of silence on American war crimes


[05-Mar-22 09:35 PM] Trask#2574
Nah, I'm not. I'm pretty consistent in opposing all armed conflict, not just the ones where big bad Russia is involved.


[05-Mar-22 09:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
western media does a fucking awful job of reporting news

[05-Mar-22 09:35 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
But I don't think it's really fair to be like "well you've said nothing about Yemen, does that mean you support US air strikes" or whatever


[05-Mar-22 09:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but just because one isn't every day sitting there condemning every war whilst obsessing over ukraine doesnt make them a hypocrite


[05-Mar-22 09:36 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
you cannot expect the average australian to know tonnes about every conflict


[05-Mar-22 09:36 PM] Trask#2574

[05-Mar-22 09:37 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
yes because every australian should be expected to think "oh ok ukraines being invaded i should focus on every single international conflict simulataneously rn"


[05-Mar-22 09:37 PM] Trask#2574
Yes I can. Its your fucking civic responsibility.


[05-Mar-22 09:37 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
At least, in an Australian context


[05-Mar-22 09:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it would be like telling a random chinese person that they are a genocide supporter despite the fact their government definately isnt telling them about what they're doing


[05-Mar-22 09:37 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
it is not the civic responsiblity of every australian to know about everything


[05-Mar-22 09:37 PM] 12MaxWild#6477

No. But sanctions will entrench and strengthen the regime while causing mass suffering, not lead to the end of the war. This has been the historical experience in every single country subjected to similar sanctions.

I don't think it's a bad thing to share articles from biased outlets that are correct - like, I don't want to draw an equivalence between RT and a Western media outlet, but I don't think there's anything wrong with sharing an RT article that is factually correct or a CNN article that is factually correct, even if I don't like either of these news sources and I wouldn't get my news primarily from either of them


[05-Mar-22 09:43 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
no australian is not denouncing all the individual war crimes in the world because it doesn't fit their agenda, they're not denouncing it because they don't know about it!! stop expecting people to know everything about everything!! let people denounce war crimes against Ukranians without you attacking them for it!!


[05-Mar-22 09:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[05-Mar-22 09:44 PM] Trask#2574
Look you believe whatever you want. But the experience in Iraq, Iran tells us that sanctions simply do not lead to regime change. That's presuming that regime change is even desirable in the first place. You really think Putin is just going to go and Russia is going to become a normal parliamentary democracy? Suffering and privation will deepen the ultranationalist mood in Russia, not end it.


[05-Mar-22 09:45 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Westerners hate RT because it acts *exactly the same* as CNN or Sky but does it to benefit the KREMLIN instead of a liberal democratic order they blindly accept as the end of history

no i think that if there is no economy the army stops - i never once thought this would cause regime change

sure, it would be nice if every single person had the time and capacity to engage in activism against the saudi, syrian or ethiopian regimes, while actively calling out Australia's mistreatment of refugees and asylum seekers, but they can't

Like, yes, of course RT has ulterior motives in reporting American war crimes, their goal is to advance Russian power globally and they will do this and ignore the war crimes of the Russian military or the crimes of the Russian government, I don't think that sharing RT articles inherently means that you're enabling the latter

I am not massively interested in engaging with this conversation as I'm not entirely sure where it's going but to be clear - I don't think anyone expects every Australian to be read up on the geopolitical and ethnocultural divisions of every aspect of the Yemeni civil war or whatever.

Almost a racist attitude tbh. The apartheid regime did not fall due to the West. It fell because of mass opposition by the black population led by the ANC. The sanctions were just performative nonsense that harmed the average black South African more than they did the apartheid regime.  Thatcher and Reagan pursued them only on the condition that the ANC stop the armed struggle and come to a shitty negotiated settlement with the regime.


[05-Mar-22 09:52 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
that is not a racist fucking attitude


[05-Mar-22 09:52 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
mandela said that it helped the ANC gain momentum and sped up the collapse of the apartheid regime as they found it harder to fund their oppression

Think of it this way. Do you not think that saying that the Black struggle against apartheid only succeeded because of western sanctions and not their own blood and struggle could be construed as racist?


[05-Mar-22 09:53 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Like I don't think anyone is being productive by being outraged by Dave at Toowoomba for being unaware of the American air strikes in Yemen or whatever, but I think it's fair to expect people on this server, who are presumably young, educated, and with (let's be honest) a lot of free time on their hands, to be moreso aware


[05-Mar-22 09:53 PM] 12MaxWild#6477

Its also not a similar situation at all. The ruling group in South Africa were a tiny racial minority. They could not leverage the nationalism engendered by the sanctions to increase their own support.

It's been understood that even in Syria that establishing a no-fly zone would mean war. There isn't really a scenario where NATO air can enforce a no-fly zone without engaging Russian air and starting a war.

The 2014 sanctions surely got Russia to withdraw from Crimea

Sanctions have, of course, gotten Iran to abandon its nuclear program and stop sponsoring terror

According to Putin's plan, Belarus’ troops had to enter Ukraine a week ago. But something went wrong. Some officers resigned, some fled Belarus and contacted us. Conscripts are massively fleeing. Apparently, some generals opposed the participation of Belarus in the war. https://t.co/a4xN6GaQqk

Yeah lot of varying information coming out about him. Common consensus seems to be that he was gonna be charged with treason and was resisting, but beyond that information is scares. Very bizarre all around.

> Ali Soufan, a security consultant and former FBI agent who has studied Azov, estimates that more than 17,000 foreign fighters have come to Ukraine over the past six years from 50 countries.
> 
> The vast majority have no apparent links to far-right ideology. But as Soufan looked into the recruitment methods of Ukraine’s more radical militias, he found an alarming pattern. It reminded him of Afghanistan in the 1990s, after Soviet forces withdrew and the U.S. failed to fill the security vacuum. “Pretty soon the extremists took over. The Taliban was in charge. And we did not wake up until 9/11,” Soufan tells TIME. “This is the parallel now with Ukraine.”
> 
> At a hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security in September 2019, Soufan urged lawmakers to take the threat more seriously. The following month, 40 members of Congress signed a letter calling—unsuccessfully—for the U.S. State Department to designate Azov a foreign terrorist organization. “Azov has been recruiting, radicalizing, and training American citizens for years,” the letter said. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, later confirmed in testimony to the U.S. Senate that American white supremacists are “actually traveling overseas to train.”

[07-Mar-22 02:29 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Like this still happens in Russia itself, the BJP in India has ties to fascist and Neo-Nazi movements


[07-Mar-22 02:30 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Shiv Sena is literally founded on and governs Maharashtra on an anti-foreigner, Maratahi supremacist platform


[07-Mar-22 02:30 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's a fairly common part of democracy and not entirely unique to Ukraine or even post-Soviet countries


[07-Mar-22 02:30 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But ultimately it is most rife in former Yugoslavia and the post-Soviet world


[07-Mar-22 02:35 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

[07-Mar-22 02:36 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

That is a fair assessment but I don't think it should actively inhibit aid being given to the Ukrainian Government and military since overall the vast majority of it does go to the ordinary Ukrainian Government which requires the support of the West in order to actively survive militarily. Withholding the export of weapons to Ukraine ultimately makes Ukraine unable to fight and more likely to fall which is why I personally believe it is worth it in the long term

Do we know how much goes to Nazis? How much of it goes to war criminals? Zelensky appointed a known war criminal as Governor of Odessa just last week, so I question how uninvolved the Ukrainian government is in all this. It seems many Ukrainian Nazi units have concerning connections to the Ukrainian government and far-right political parties, and all of the above have shady connections to oligarchs. I don't want to support this Nazi-corruption circlejerk


[07-Mar-22 02:52 PM] Trask#2574
For me this is not a good enough response.


[07-Mar-22 02:54 PM] Trask#2574
I am against sending arms overseas in any instance. But even if there was an argument to be made for helping the Ukranians, why should we hand them over when there is a possibility, nomatter how remote, that they could end up in the hands of deranged extremists with a documented record of human rights abuses.


[07-Mar-22 02:56 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I think the before the invasion, they were trying to keep the neo-nazi groups at arms length at least (probably not actively discouraging them or trying to shut down) to keep distance between the government and the groups. now with the invasion, everything seems to be on the table if it helps beat the russians, so anyone and anything that will fight gets weapons


[07-Mar-22 02:58 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Yes, and I think that's a very bad policy, especially if they hope to continue existing in the medium- to long term


[07-Mar-22 03:00 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
agreed. but this point their options seem to be, support the groups to slightly increase the odds of surviving in the short term or don't and increase the odds of a russian victory and the potential end to ukraine. 

medium-long term consequences are not a consideration at this point


[07-Mar-22 03:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I think it's a bit unfair to characterize an ultimately desperate move with the specific armament policy of Ukraine relating to their military which is where the war is ultimately going to be fought over civilian militias. I think their armament strategy is quite considered because ultimately the same civilian armament programs occurs in most countries undergoing a lengthy invasion


[07-Mar-22 03:03 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The argument to aid them is that without it, Ukraine will be left defenseless and would have likely already lost the war without their capacity to engage being supplemented by Western equipment and armaments. The chance of weapon exports being used to arm the Ukrainian far-right in my mind overshadows the far more likely reality that without Western military equipment the Russians would have won, Azov would be radicalized further and more people would seek to join as a guerilla campaign in Russia etc.


[07-Mar-22 03:04 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Like ultimately the direct export of weapons to the Ukrainian Government strengthens the position of the Ukrainian formalized military and Government, without these arms it is more likely that there would still be conflict but it would be way more irregular


[07-Mar-22 03:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
That is the environment a group like Azov thrives in


[07-Mar-22 03:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Because the far-right wins during a total national collapse of any country especially after a military defeat


[07-Mar-22 03:06 PM] Trask#2574
This is some intense 3D chess logic.


[07-Mar-22 03:07 PM] Trask#2574
Russia is still going to win.


[07-Mar-22 03:07 PM] Trask#2574
The only difference is now the insane Nazi guerrillas are going to be armed to the teeth with foreign ordinance.


[07-Mar-22 03:09 PM] Trask#2574
pouring guns into a conflict zone never solves the problem. it always intensifies the conflict and makes things worse


[07-Mar-22 03:09 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It is an ongoing conflict and I absolutely believe there is going to be mistakes made during their desperate process to arm people to create a resistance to Russian invasion. The appointment of Marchenko to Odessa Governor was mainly a military appointment relating to him being involved with the 28th Mechanized rather than due to his Aidar ties which makes far more sense for an appointment as Governor to a city under threat


[07-Mar-22 03:09 PM] Trask#2574
its going to be just like Afghanistan but on steroids.


[07-Mar-22 03:11 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
most probably, but the other option was to roll over and let russia do whatever they wanted which was also an awful option. so damned if they do and damned if they don't


[07-Mar-22 03:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The question is about the timeline of victory for the Russian Government. I don't think anyone should really expect Ukraine to win the entire war in a protracted engagement but the delaying of a Russian victory plays into the benefit of the Ukrainian Government and decreases the Russian capacity for the conflict


[07-Mar-22 03:11 PM] Trask#2574

[07-Mar-22 03:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Prolonging the war is ultimately the strategy of the Ukrainian Government because it means they can actually win. People are going to die in the aftermath of a Russian victory and the Government involved in post-invasion Ukrainian life will likely go the path of Kaydrov and be a repressive state of warlordism. I think ultimately a prolonged current war which lasts months is going to lead to a better way of life and more living Ukrainians in a state of their own than a scenario of Russian victory now.

I would rather that a free Ukraine exist than a scenario of Russian looting, warlordism, authoritarianism and violence persecuted after the war.

Inb4 Biden loses the midterms over not implementing the no fly zone


[07-Mar-22 04:46 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
this is impossible because he was already going to lose the midterms (over being Joe Biden)


[07-Mar-22 04:46 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
undoubtedly there will be certain (lovely) elements of the Democratic Party who push the narrative that he should've turned Russia to glass, though


[07-Mar-22 04:46 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
and that would've won the midterms


[07-Mar-22 04:47 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Biden absolutely would have won the midterms had he invaded Russia, because it's difficult not to when habeus corpus is in place

Trans and non-binary people trapped in war-torn Ukraine
The rule forcing men aged 18 to 60 to stay and fight has left many trans women and non-binary people stranded in the country.

> “While the world sanctions Russia for its barbaric atrocities in Ukraine, some prefer to make money soaked in Ukrainian blood,” Kuleba tweeted, characterizing the policy as “immoral and a blow to Ukrainian-Israeli relations.”

> “Here is @EL_AL_ISRAEL accepting payments in Russian banking system ‘Mir’ designed to evade sanctions,” he continued, attaching a screenshot of a payment page for El Al bookings that accepts funds from Mir as well as Visa and Mastercard.

> El Al quickly responded to the accusation, saying in a statement that “it is unfortunate that a simple check was not done with us before the misleading tweet, as the facts are entirely different.”

> The airline said it stopped accepting Mir payments on February 28 — four days after Russia’s widespread invasion of Ukraine commenced. Indeed, attempts on Monday in the US, Israel, and Russia to book flights on El Al’s website did not bring up a Mir payment option.

The Kremlin has announced its demands for ending the war in Ukraine:
-Ukraine must change its constitution to guarantee it won't  join any "blocs", i.e. NATO + EU.
-Must recognise Crimea as part of Russia.
-Must recognise the eastern separatist regions as independent.

It’s not *the worst deal*, but the Western Separatist Government recognition one is a real killer. Like you could probably get away with Crimea, but that’s a big ask for those two

Ukraine will probably negotiate to some extent on that though


[08-Mar-22 04:40 PM] MR AWESOME#2496

[08-Mar-22 04:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I doubt Ukraine will try to keep Crimea at this point considering Russia has occupied it for years now


[08-Mar-22 04:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496

Though I can't see Ukraine accepting it, given they literally just applied to enter the EU


[08-Mar-22 05:02 PM] Trask#2574

then they are also to blame for further violence.

[08-Mar-22 05:03 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Yeah my thoughts


[08-Mar-22 05:04 PM] Trask#2574
They should take the deal but I don't think they will. A lot of people in the West dont really want this to end.


[08-Mar-22 05:04 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I don't see Ukraine accepting though, and honestly I don't think this is any sort of genuine offer from the Kremlin


[08-Mar-22 05:04 PM] mikiboss#2416
I could see that EU deal as being Ukraine buying themselves a bargaining chip, but I'm not sure entirely


[08-Mar-22 05:05 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Seems to me solely a rhetoric device over anything else

Do you think the EU is suicidal enough to admit Ukraine?


[08-Mar-22 05:06 PM] дётrivøre#5054
It's a PR victory for Russia if they offer what is apparently a somewhat sensible deal and then the Ukrainians reject it


[08-Mar-22 05:06 PM] Trask#2574
Who knows? It will have gotten them what they wanted in Ukraine in terms of Crimea and Donbas and keeping them out of NATO and the EU, but also set in stone that they own that land. They could have just annexed Donbas but with a peace deal like this Crimea and Donbas would both become internationally recognised parts of Russia.


[08-Mar-22 05:07 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
This is exactly my thoughts - I'm split as to whether it's a genuine goal of Russia but they cannot think that the Ukrainians will accept it


[08-Mar-22 05:08 PM] Trask#2574
At this point I dont see much point in Putin pushing even further with Ukraine. He could establish a puppet government and set terms by force, but what would that get him? Nobody would recognise the new regime. If he does a peace deal then his new conquests are ratified under international law.


[08-Mar-22 05:09 PM] дётrivøre#5054
He could get all of Ukraine to the Dnieper


[08-Mar-22 05:09 PM] Youmaton#1190

I have no idea what Russia's goal in Ukraine is when it comes to territory


[08-Mar-22 05:09 PM] Youmaton#1190
Recognising his annexations means recognising that invasions of sovereign nations for the annexation of land is now fine again


[08-Mar-22 05:10 PM] дётrivøre#5054
There was that leaked Russian news report about how they intend to Balkanize Ukraine and turn it into four or five Russian-aligned "republics"


[08-Mar-22 05:10 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
If he only wants the Donbas, why invade the whole country just to legitimise the invasion of the Donbas


[08-Mar-22 05:10 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
If he wants the whole country or the Russian-speaking bits why offer peace (presuming it's a genuine offer)


[08-Mar-22 05:10 PM] Trask#2574
He wont be charged with the crime of aggression, that's all spin.

He has the legal justification that he intervened on behalf of the separatists.


[08-Mar-22 05:14 PM] Youmaton#1190
He invaded a nation to take land off of it. Twice.


[08-Mar-22 05:14 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Indisputably, recognising this offer would be good for Ukraine and good for avoiding human suffering, but it's a horrible precedent to set, and politically untenable


[08-Mar-22 05:14 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
If I was Zelensky I'd probably rather take my chances as a war hero than go out as the guy who gave Russia the Donbas

[08-Mar-22 05:15 PM] Trask#2574
That is just a matter of perspective. Whether you like it or not he has a legal justification for his actions in Russia recognising the separatists as independent states and signing defence treaties with them.

The Golan Heights Law is the Israeli law which applies Israel's government and laws to the Golan Heights. It was ratified by the Knesset by a vote of 63―21, on December 14, 1981.

I'm glad this was rejected. I don't think it was realistic to provide the Ukrainian airforce these MiG's without seriously inflaming the situation. I know a lot of this has been doublespeak and jumping over lines on what constitutes as 'too far' in terms of military assistance, but the Polish MiG-29's I think were a little too far into NATO sticking their foot right through it.

Yeah I read that article a little bit earlier when it was doing the rounds online. It's annoying because I actually like the text of the piece, and think it's a good way to show Venezuela's recovery, if slow, is material. However the framing in the title and some of the opening paragraphs is really painting a different story.

Very poor tactics displayed by this Russian armored force so close to Kyiv. They're well within range of Ukrainian artillery in Kyiv, they're on an obvious avenue of approach, and they still decided to bunch up like this, leaving them more vulnerable to indirect fire. https://t.co/3ShhyF5OsE

tbh it's really not much of a difference on gas or oil, I think it's either 1% or less of our share in Australia


[11-Mar-22 05:05 PM] mikiboss#2416
but prices will still rise from this


[11-Mar-22 05:06 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Might I point out that prices have been hitting $2/L for the past fortnight...yet the sanction has only now been applied...almost as if exorbitant prices don't actually rely on supply constraints :emotiguy:

Russia’s war fuels fears of $2.50 petrol prices in Australia
The US and UK are ramping up sanctions on Russia’s energy exports and the global energy crunch has set Australian petrol prices spiralling upwards.

[11-Mar-22 06:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Both times only being PM for a constitutional reason


[11-Mar-22 06:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The first time was after the 2000 coup where he was PM for seven minutes in order to sign and declare a state of emergency and hand emergency powers to the military and President


[11-Mar-22 06:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Wait


[11-Mar-22 06:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The wiki article will explain better


[11-Mar-22 06:51 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
"In 1999, Momoedonu had been elected on the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) ticket to represent the Vuda Open Constituency in the House of Representatives, and subsequently appointed to the Cabinet. He was the only minister not present in the Parliament building when George Speight stormed the complex on 19 May 2000, taking Chaudhry and other government members hostage and staging a coup d'état. The President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, wanted to assume emergency powers to deal with the situation, but was unable to do so, because constitutionally, the President is not allowed to act except on the advice of the Prime Minister – and Prime Minister Chaudhry, being in captivity, was unable to render such advice. In a move which some legal scholars have questioned as being of doubtful constitutional validity, Mara therefore dismissed Chaudhry and appointed Momoedonu in his place on 27 May, so that Momoedonu could "advise" him to suspend Parliament and assume emergency powers. Upon tendering the requisite advice, Momoedonu promptly resigned. The whole procedure had taken only a few minutes. (The move backfired when, two days later, Mara was himself deposed by the Commander of the Fiji Military Forces, Commodore Frank Bainimarama)."


[11-Mar-22 06:52 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
"Momoedonu's second appointment as Prime Minister, on 14 March 2001, came in the wake of an Appeal Court verdict that the interim government of President Josefa Iloilo and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, both of whom had taken office when the coup had been put down, was unconstitutional, and ordered that the previous government be reinstated. That would mean reinstating Ratu Mara as President or else convening the Great Council of Chiefs to elect a new President. Mara moved to spare the country further constitutional trauma by resigning officially, retroactive to 29 May 2000 (the day on which he had been deposed), thereby validating the Iloilo regime, which was duly affirmed by the Great Council of Chiefs. The court verdict was also widely interpreted to mean that Mahendra Chaudhry should be reinstated as Prime Minister, but President Iloilo disagreed. He argued that defections from Chaudhry's Labour Party meant that he no longer had majority support in the House of Representatives, and therefore the President was not obliged to appoint him.

Iloilo had apparently decided already that the best way forward for Fiji was to take the question of the country's leadership back to the people, but he could not constitutionally call an early election except on the advice of the Prime Minister – advice that he was sure Chaudhry would refuse to render. He therefore appointed Momoedonu. 

Momoedonu rendered his formal advice to President Iloilo to dissolve Parliament and call a general election. Mission accomplished, Momoedonu resigned the next day, allowing Laisenia Qarase to resume the office of Prime Minister. In the ensuing election, Qarase was confirmed as Prime Minister when his newly formed Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua won a plurality. Momoedonu, however, stood as a candidate for the House of Representatives on the Bei Kai Viti Party ticket, but was defeated."

It does depend what they count as 1 shelling. I think it was Mariupol (but might've been a different city) had Russian planes fly low and drop 8 bombs (at least some were 500kg bombs) on a food line. 89 lots of that would level most of a suburb


[11-Mar-22 10:39 PM] boomfa#6923
Yeah I’m just assuming if they leveled city blocks we’d see pictures

Can't get it out of my head that Europe cried about a 'migrant crisis' in 2015 against 1.4m refugees fleeing war in Syria and yet quickly absorbed some 2m Ukrainians within days, complete with flags and piano music. 

Europe never had a migrant crisis. It has a racism crisis.

I want to be clear: We will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full might of a united and galvanized NATO.

But we will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine.
 
A direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III. And something we must strive to prevent.

It said membership would have serious military and political consequences, including retaliation.

English subtitles for that unbelievable viral video of two women speaking with a cameraman near Moscow's Red Square.

First person holds up a sign that just says "two words." Arrested in seconds.

A second woman is seemingly about to voice support for Putin. Also arrested. https://t.co/WzKMiAs485

Was Putin kept in the dark about how weak his army is?
New equipment, new ideas about future war, a more professional force at higher readiness and lessons from recent combat in Syria. In theory, these elements should have given Russia a war-winning combination in Ukraine. What has gone wrong? Mick Ryan explains.

[16-Mar-22 01:59 PM] Perekai#6805
Wow this is just revolting. Force them to speak out against their autocratic government or not participate in their career. Other than the narcissistic, masturbatory act of getting their own rocks off on a player giving an insincere denouncement of their country, all this really achieves is putting the Russian and Belarusian players in a precarious position with their personal lives back home.


[16-Mar-22 01:59 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
alright calm down

But seriously - it's a forced denouncement. It's insincere, so who is it convincing? This really serves no purpose at all.

It would just be another way of trying to make life difficult/awkward in Russia to try and get people questioning what is going on.

I don't think I agree with this one, but I can see a small reason why they are doing it.


[16-Mar-22 03:43 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Completely agree


[16-Mar-22 03:43 PM] MR AWESOME#2496

[16-Mar-22 03:44 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
This whole thing against Russians is fucking demented


[16-Mar-22 03:44 PM] Perekai#6805
Oh I understand the purpose, don't misunderstand me. I just think it's a fairly empty goal. If they force them to speak out, did they even really speak out? Isn't it just easily thrown away as someone paying lip service so they can play tennis? I just think it's pointless.


[16-Mar-22 03:45 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
God...imagine if I decided not to hire a Chinese person unless they denounced Zi Jinping...like, that's purely discriminatory


[16-Mar-22 03:46 PM] Perekai#6805
This is an opinion I have divorced from the Russia situation, to be honest. This could be any similar scenario, and it'd just as pointless and self-aggrandising for the Tennis officials. Or at least that's what I think.


[16-Mar-22 03:46 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
There is a clear and obvious difference between a random employee and a public figure like a sports star and you know it.

Also China is not the worst human rights abuser on the planet at the moment


[16-Mar-22 03:47 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It doesn't matter who they are if it's still discriminatory


[16-Mar-22 03:48 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
If I made hollywood films and I said "I won't cast Chinese actors like Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen unless they denounce Xi Jinping", that's still entirely discriminatory


[16-Mar-22 03:48 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And yes, I'm just using China as an example


[16-Mar-22 03:49 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Because it doesn't matter who the example is


[16-Mar-22 03:51 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Forcing Russians to go through extra hoops and express forced political opinions simply because of the country they were born into is clear discrimination

Russia's single decision that sent 'bewildered young men' to fight ...
When Vladimir Putin started the war in Ukraine, he had a large army at his disposal, stockpiles of heavy weapons and a wealth of experience from previous military campaigns to tap into. His neighbour was outnumbered, outgunned and outmatched. So why is Russia's military now facing a morale problem?

Truth be told this is mostly not new for Ukraine, given how Party of Regions was soft-banned (kinda killed itself/abandoned), and how Ukraine has banned the Communist Party there. I suspect the ban, made under the martial law provisions, will be lifted when martial law will be, since the parties themselves aren't really doing anything atm, given Ukraine is like, not exactly concerned about the functions of parliament.

[20-Mar-22 06:18 PM] mikiboss#2416
The example with Nashi for instance I believes related to the information revealed in January 2022 by British Intelligence publicly, where they stated that Russia  wanted to put party leader, Yevhen Murayev, as the new president of a Russian puppet government. For Opposition Platform for Life, it's long been suspected, and softly confirmed that Viktor Medvedchuk has a very close relationship with the Kremlin specifically, having close communication with Putin, and with iltel also suspecting as being an alterative head of state.


[20-Mar-22 06:20 PM] mikiboss#2416
I don't really have a take on this, because like I'm not anywhere knowledgeable enough to have a really clear take, and like why would I even bother, but those I think would be the justification for those 2 cases.

`Wali has been praised for his bravery, having left behind his fiancée, one-year-old son and a job as an IT programmer to join the Ukrainian resistance. 

Speaking about his partner, Wali said: “She was very afraid, she said 'we need you here, your son needs you'. 

“But eventually she calmed down and she said 'ok, do your duty but please be safe, don't take any risks'.

“There were a lot of emotions as I left. You don't know when you're going to be back, or whether you're even going to make it back. 

“But I know I have a duty to my family as well as to the world, I won't stay here any longer than I have to.

“The saddest thing for me was missing my son's birthday celebration. I watched a few minutes over the phone. I was here in the dark, in an abandoned building with my flashlight – it felt like I was on a different planet to them.”`
Nobody should be praising this as 'bravery'

damn he really got fucked didn't he


[21-Mar-22 03:30 PM] NGSpy#8096

‘Bravery’????


[21-Mar-22 04:50 PM] doctor#0002
This shit is cowardice


[21-Mar-22 04:58 PM] Trask#2574
so brave to just destroy your own life for no reason


[21-Mar-22 05:00 PM] Trask#2574
there seems to be no collective consciousness around war being essentially futile and meaningless these days. 2 generations of first person shooters and Marvel have done irreparable damage to the culture and the brains of young men.


[21-Mar-22 05:00 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Like Mufasa says, "I'm only brave when I have to be. Bravery does not mean I go looking for trouble"


[21-Mar-22 05:01 PM] Trask#2574
ikr. Like hes not been forced into this situation. He volunteered to go and die in a foreign country


[21-Mar-22 05:02 PM] doctor#0002
I will proceed to quote game of thrones
> Bran thought about it. 'Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?'
> 'That is the only time a man can be brave,' his father told him.


[21-Mar-22 05:02 PM] Trask#2574
All the comforts and conveniences of modern life, a family who loves him, and now he's just a stain on a wall in some shithole. All his own fault and choice


[21-Mar-22 05:02 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Yes, it's not bravery. It's just stupidity leaving behind your now widowed partner and now fatherless baby son


[21-Mar-22 05:03 PM] MR AWESOME#2496

[21-Mar-22 05:06 PM] дётrivøre#5054
The reason WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq were so culturally impactful is because people going in did not understand that they had nothing to gain and everything to lose


[21-Mar-22 05:06 PM] Trask#2574
i think we underestimate the culture shift that took place in the late 90's, early 2000's

Yeah but almost all the people who fought in those wars had very little choice in the matter

[21-Mar-22 05:14 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
the Ukrainians have very little choice in this one as well. and helping those with no choice is not a bad thing


[21-Mar-22 05:15 PM] doctor#0002
Oh baby a triple


[21-Mar-22 05:18 PM] Trask#2574
Well tbh if I was a Ukrainian I would try to run away instead of be conscripted.


[21-Mar-22 05:19 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Depends on what exactly you mean by “helping”


[21-Mar-22 05:20 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
i probably would as well, but that it not a choice for all of them either


[21-Mar-22 05:21 PM] Trask#2574
If it ever happened in Australia I would just be a conscientious objector. But god knows what they are doing with those in Ukraine.


[21-Mar-22 05:21 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
i'd just really hope to never be in the situation where i have to choose


[21-Mar-22 05:22 PM] Trask#2574
there is no scenario in which I would ever pick up a gun and shoot at another human being


[21-Mar-22 05:23 PM] Viado Celtru#6988

[21-Mar-22 05:23 PM] Trask#2574

[21-Mar-22 05:26 PM] NGSpy#8096
didn't they try that in 'Nam and everyone hated it


[21-Mar-22 05:26 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Although alternative service isn't always provided in conscript countries


[21-Mar-22 05:26 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Like, South Korea didn't allow alternative service until 2014 I think


[21-Mar-22 05:26 PM] NGSpy#8096

American conscription was a yikes

deliberately not conscripting the national guard


[21-Mar-22 05:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
national guard being mainly white and middle class


[21-Mar-22 05:27 PM] NGSpy#8096

[21-Mar-22 05:27 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Australia has had conscription as well


[21-Mar-22 05:28 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Well, for WW2, not Vietnam


[21-Mar-22 05:28 PM] Trask#2574
Yeah they still did it though


[21-Mar-22 05:28 PM] Trask#2574
Bush talked about it for Iraq but they didn't actually need it


[21-Mar-22 05:29 PM] NGSpy#8096
they did do it, but it would be political suicide to do it now


[21-Mar-22 05:29 PM] NGSpy#8096
Australia did have the draft for Vietnam


[21-Mar-22 05:29 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Yes, I was incorrect


[21-Mar-22 05:29 PM] NGSpy#8096
that's why Whitlam got rid of it in 72


[21-Mar-22 05:35 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Conscription has always been for the underclass only


[21-Mar-22 05:36 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Besides, the smart ones enlisted before getting drafted so they could choose their occupation in the military


[21-Mar-22 05:36 PM] дётrivøre#5054
The draft was basically just to get poor and minority men to fight as grunts


[21-Mar-22 05:44 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Civil unrest can still occur but won't get drafted to put down a rebellion probably


[21-Mar-22 05:45 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's the old levy system


[21-Mar-22 05:45 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Not much difference from the feudalism of old in many ways


[21-Mar-22 05:45 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
They get their ideal group of soldiers, a smaller group of sickos who are after killing and butchering their fellow man


[21-Mar-22 05:45 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
And then when they need more they get everyone else in society

Africa (1.2 billion people) has not sanctioned, Russia
India (1.3 billion people), has not sanctioned Russia.
China  (1.4 billion people), has not sanctioned Russia.
USA (330m)+UK (62m)+France (67m) + others. =/=(1 billion)

> Some people say that the no-fly zone would reduce civilian casualties in Ukraine and drive Russia out of Ukraine faster. Others say that a no-fly zone would escalate the conflict with Russia, and risk massive death in a global nuclear war. Which position is closer to yours?

Ukraine reports 300 died in Russian strike on theater
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian authorities said Friday that about 300 people died when a Russian airstrike last week blew up a theater in Mariupol where hundreds of civilians were sheltering — a catastrophic loss of civilian life   that, if confirmed, is likely to further crank up pressure on Western nations to step up military aid.

Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy's address to the Greek parliament on Thursday caused an outrage from opposition parties after a man who identified himself as an ethnic Greek member of Ukraine's ultranationalist Azov battalion appeared on a video.

[16-Apr-22 02:38 PM] Trask#2574
The sinking of the General Belgrano was hardly an L when it was not even participating in combat and was streaming back to port outside the exclusion zone. Plus the only reason that the British were able to pinpoint its location at all is that Chile fed them the radar data they needed. Was just a totally unnecessary massacre.


[16-Apr-22 03:25 PM] Wanuke#5929
> outside the exclusion zone
You do realize that was irrelevant right. exclusion zones are declared for the benefit of neutral vessels. the TEZ was just the zone that the british would fire on any ship without warning if they entered, it was just to keep neutral ships out. The TEZ had no bearing on where the actual war was happening.


[16-Apr-22 03:31 PM] Trask#2574
This is fake news.


[16-Apr-22 03:32 PM] Trask#2574
The exclusion zone was the area in which the British said they would destroy any Argentine vessels using nuclear submarines.


[16-Apr-22 03:32 PM] Wanuke#5929
The Argentines litterally gave up the claim it was a war crime in the 90s


[16-Apr-22 03:32 PM] Trask#2574
I am not the Argentine government.


[16-Apr-22 03:33 PM] Wanuke#5929
nowhere in the declaration of the TEZ does it mention destroy any Argentine vessels using nuclear submarines
> In announcing the establishment of a Maritime Exclusion Zone around the Falkland Islands, Her Majesty's Government made it clear that this measure was without prejudice to the right of the United Kingdom to take whatever additional measures may be needed in the exercise of its right of self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. In this connection Her Majesty's Government now wishes to make clear that any approach on the part of Argentine warships, including submarines, naval auxiliaries or military aircraft, which could amount to a threat to interfere with the mission of British Forces in the South Atlantic will encounter the appropriate response. All Argentine aircraft, including civil aircraft engaged in surveillance of these British forces, will be regarded as hostile and are liable to be dealt with accordingly.[3]


[16-Apr-22 03:33 PM] Trask#2574
That doesn't concern the TEZ.


[16-Apr-22 03:35 PM] Wanuke#5929
right


[16-Apr-22 03:36 PM] Wanuke#5929
The attack on the belgrano was entirely legitimate, was it sailing away and was it morally reprehensible, yes, was it a war crime, no, international law is pretty clear that the heading and location of a belligerent naval vessel has no bearing on its status.


[16-Apr-22 03:49 PM] Trask#2574
Look not really concerned if it was a war crime under international law. They deliberately sunk the ship using two torpedoes when they could just have disabled it using one and ensured it went back to port. As a consequence hundreds of young men burned to death on the ship or froze to death as they waited more than a day for help (when the British knew full well where they were and could have informed the Argentine Navy). This is all while the Peruvians and Americans were trying to bring the British to the table to organize an end to hostilities.


[16-Apr-22 03:53 PM] Wanuke#5929
Great, we're in agreement then mostly. 

I disagree on the one torpedo strategy, that would have called in every anti submarine patrol aircraft and helicopter (The Belgrano had one on board) the argentines could throw into hunting the submarine.


[16-Apr-22 03:54 PM] Wanuke#5929
but, yes, obviously the british could have called in rescue, they were in no immediate danger


[16-Apr-22 03:54 PM] Trask#2574
Well the ship was basically sinking when the first torpedo hit. Anything that set off had nowhere to go.


[16-Apr-22 03:54 PM] Trask#2574
So yes, I guess theoretically they could have done a suicide mission.


[16-Apr-22 03:55 PM] Wanuke#5929
In case you didint know, the best weapon that is designed to kill attack submarines besides other attack submarines is helicopters with dipping sonar


[16-Apr-22 03:55 PM] Trask#2574
The captain has said since he could have gotten it back to port if it had just been the first hit, but he's backflipped so many times that I honestly don't believe much of what he says.


[16-Apr-22 03:56 PM] Wanuke#5929
🤷


[16-Apr-22 03:56 PM] Wanuke#5929
He definetly would have booked it


[16-Apr-22 03:56 PM] Wanuke#5929
no question there


[16-Apr-22 03:56 PM] Wanuke#5929
but, he also could have launched the helicopter given the chance, and they are suprisingly effective submarine killers


[16-Apr-22 03:57 PM] Wanuke#5929
the subs can't hit them, and they can drop sonar way further down than ships in motion since they can stay stationary


[16-Apr-22 03:57 PM] Wanuke#5929
and they can launch torpedos


[17-Apr-22 09:32 AM] BloodyChrome#8410
You know what would've saved the lives of young men? Not invading the Falklands

[17-Apr-22 12:41 PM] BloodyChrome#8410
Indeed but the blame is on the Argentine government


[17-Apr-22 04:32 PM] Trask#2574
Wasn't Argentina torpedoes that killed them

I mean everyone sane knew that from the start, NATO wasn't going to do anything that might start WW3, another 6 months and they'll let Putin back, especially the EU, they need Russia more than Russia needs them. Yeah they've started the process of not depending on them, but that's going to take years, if not decades. And as much as he's lashing out cause the war isn't going right for him, deep down Putin knows it. He just has to hold out to stop the oligarchs rebelling.

The Finnish did the same in the Winter War, as to not reveal the true extent of their casualties or how close they actually were to breaking. I don’t like it, but I’m more inclined towards believing it’s so the Russians don’t know how close they really are to collapsing.

Guys Erdogan still didn’t definitively say he would block Sweden and Finland’s accession to NATO. 

Still signalling. Underlying the sanctions. Beware.

Kind of shows what a joke NATO is. It's whole existence and strategic vision hinges on Turkey but they are a belligerent regional power whose interests directly contradict the US 9 times out of 10

Novus: Över hälften av svenskarna säger ja till Nato
Nästan sex av tio svenskar, 58 procent, säger sig vara för ett Natomedlemskap. Detta är första gången det är statistiskt säkerställt att över hälften av svenskarna ställer sig bakom ett medlemskap i den militära alliansen, enligt Novus.

> According to the latest survey, 58 percent of Swedes say yes to NATO, 23 percent say no and 19 percent are insecure. The measurements are made weekly.

Ergodan sees himself as the great negotiator, look how he's offered to host the "peace talks" between Ukraine and Russia. He knows all that but he'll play both sides of the field as long as possible, will probably force Sweden to disavow the PKK, maybe get a few extra jets out of the US, but ultimately he'll fall in line, he knows since he helped Ukraine militarily he's fucked if he stands alone and pisses off NATO.
