This is the thread where you apply for citizenship of the USSR, choose a Union Republic and are enrolled to vote. You can also ask to join a media organisation or the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Just comment which Union Republic you'd like to join down below, and any other requests. If populations need to be balanced there may be some negotiations necessary.

The Troika should be able to grant your requests as soon as possible.

When me and mum got home couldn't find one of our two cats, in particular the big dumb one. He's only allowed in the house or in the backyard. He was in neither. So we're really worried at this point, cause he's dumb. Like, really dumb. And if he got out the front, he would be gooooone. So we're out the front and I hear him meow. It came from the house, but we knew he wasn't in there. Turns out the meow was coming from a grille that connects to under the house. So then we go into our bathroom which is in the midst of renos and pull up the shower base our bloody uncle hasn't installed yet and call for him but he doesn't come. Then our other cat, the smart one, goes under the house too. He comes out again, then goes back in, then comes out again, face covered in black cobweb each time. Then, I have a bright idea. I go into the yard and lead the cat to the bathoom using the grilles. But then, he won't come out (even though we put the stepladder down there to make stairs for him). We use food, dangle a phone charger, anything to get him out, but no. So then we think, get him close to me and I can pull him out. Well, I was kneeling for so long waiting for him to get into position. Fuckin hurt my knees. Anyway, eventually we got him with a combination of dangling the charger and dropping biscuits and I scooped him up. What a bastard.

Yes
Polska strong
Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła,
Kiedy my żyjemy.
Co nam obca przemoc wzięła,
Szablą odbierzemy.
Marsz, marsz, Dąbrowski,
Z ziemi włoskiej do Polski.
Za twoim przewodem
Złączym się z narodem.
Przejdziem Wisłę, przejdziem Wartę,
Będziem Polakami.
Dał nam przykład Bonaparte,
Jak zwyciężać mamy.
Marsz, marsz...
Jak Czarniecki do Poznania
Po szwedzkim zaborze,
Dla ojczyzny ratowania
Wrócim się przez morze.
Marsz, marsz...
Już tam ojciec do swej Basi
Mówi zapłakany —
Słuchaj jeno, pono nasi
Biją w tarabany.
Marsz, marsz...

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Senate ballot paper. The structure is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the Single Transferable Vote most of the details will go over a typical voter’s head. There’s also Droop’s proportionality criterion, which is deftly woven into its details- the mechanism of counting draws heavily from Thomas Hare’s work, for instance. The psephologists understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these criteria, to realise that they’re not just democratic- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Single Transferable Vote truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth)’s existential long title “An Act to Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the Barton government’s classic epics, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 (Cth) and Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 (Cth). I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Antony Green’s genius methodology unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Mackerras pendulum tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the scrutineers’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 2PP percentage points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎 :runas:

As a consequence people who dislike the Single Transferable Vote truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth)’s existential long title “An Act to Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the Barton government’s classic epics, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 (Cth) and Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 (Cth). I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Antony Green’s genius methodology unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Mackerras pendulum tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the scrutineers’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 2PP percentage points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎 :runas:

Welcome! This is a model version of both houses of the Australian Parliament, where users can enrol to vote in the state/division of their residence/choice, join a political party, and run for either of the two chambers in Parliament. The simulation is based largely on real life, with the voting system and political parties taken from modern politics. Please scroll through the recent posts, and take a look at the links below. We hope you will stay and join us!

Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddit’s latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team’s efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our 2017 Transparency Report. This details government and law-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don’t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, decreased slightly for both types of requests. (You’ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years here.)

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court (Montagna), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules (County of Santa Clara v. FCC) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit (Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP).

I’d also like to give an update to my last post about the investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit. I’ve mentioned before that we’re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we’re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

Reddit's new signup experience (self.announcements)

submitted 10 months ago by simbawulf[A]

Hi folks,

TL;DR People creating new accounts won't be subscribed to 50 default subreddits, and we're adding subscribe buttons to Popular.

Many years ago, we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site. At the time, our best option was to select a set of communities to feature for all new users, which we called (creatively), “the defaults”.

Over the past few years we have seen a wealth of diverse and healthy communities grow across Reddit. The default communities have done a great job as the first face of Reddit, but at our size, we can showcase many more amazing communities and conversations. We recently launched r/popular as a start to improving the community discovery experience, with extremely positive results.

New users will land on “Home” and will be presented with a quick tutorial page on how to subscribe to communities.

On “Popular,” we’ve made subscribing easier by adding in-line subscription buttons that show up next to communities you’re not subscribed to.

To the communities formerly known as defaults - thank you. You were, and will continue to be, awesome. To our new users - we’re excited to show you the breadth and depth our communities!

Thanks,

Reddit

Many years ago, we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site. At the time, our best option was to select a set of communities to feature for all new users, which we called (creatively), “the defaults”.

Over the past few years we have seen a wealth of diverse and healthy communities grow across Reddit. The default communities have done a great job as the first face of Reddit, but at our size, we can showcase many more amazing communities and conversations. We recently launched r/popular as a start to improving the community discovery experience, with extremely positive results.

New users will land on “Home” and will be presented with a quick tutorial page on how to subscribe to communities.

On “Popular,” we’ve made subscribing easier by adding in-line subscription buttons that show up next to communities

totally false. everyone knows the fastest, most dangerous, intense sport in the world is curling. I've lost 4 friends in vicious curling accidents. you'd be surprised how dangerous those brooms are. there's always a risk one could brush gently against your skin and tickle you ever so slightly. then BOOM! dead. or you could end up on the wrong side of that stone sliding on the ice. then what? at max, you've got 20-30 seconds to move a foot or two in either direction before 15 pounds of polished stone softly bumps into your shoe. BAM! insta death. please, for the love of God, don't drink and curl people.

Thomas Cranmer was born on 2 July 1489 in Nottinghamshire. His parents were minor gentry. As his father only had enough land to give his eldest son, Thomas and his younger brother joined the clergy. Cranmer was given a fellowship at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1510, which he lost when he married the daughter of a local tavern-keeper. She died in childbirth, at which point he was re-accepted by the college and devoted himself to study. He took holy orders in 1523.
A plague forced Cranmer to leave Cambridge for Essex. He came to the attention of Henry VIII, who was staying nearby. The king and his councillors found Cranmer a willing advocate for Henry's desired divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Cranmer argued the case as part of the embassy to Rome in 1530, and in 1532 became ambassador to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Cranmer was sent to Germany to learn more about Lutheranism. Here he met Margaret Osiander, the niece of a Lutheran reformer, who he married.
In 1533, Cranmer was chosen to be archbishop of Canterbury and forced (for a time) to hide his married state. Once his appointment was approved by the pope, Cranmer declared Henry's marriage to Catherine void, and four months later married him to Anne Boleyn. With Thomas Cromwell, he supported the translation of the bible into English. In 1545, he wrote a litany that is still used in the church. Under the reign of Edward VI, Cranmer was allowed to make the doctrinal changes he thought necessary to the church. In 1549, he helped complete the book of common prayer.

to be fair


[12-Apr-18 10:34 PM] Dyno#3861
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Senate ballot paper. The structure is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the Single Transferable Vote most of the details will go over a typical voter’s head. There’s also Droop’s proportionality criterion, which is deftly woven into its details- the mechanism of counting draws heavily from Thomas Hare’s work, for instance. The psephologists understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these criteria, to realise that they’re not just democratic- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Single Transferable Vote truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth)’s existential long title “An Act to Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the Barton government’s classic epics, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 (Cth) and Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 (Cth). I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Antony Green’s genius methodology unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. :joy:

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Mackerras pendulum tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the scrutineers’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 2PP percentage points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid :sunglasses: :runas:

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little.

This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where?

camera pans from wide shot of a stage dead center in the Basin Reserve with large screens set all around the stadium, to a reporter from One News

"Hi guys, if you've just joined us, we're here this evening for a unique charity event being held by The ACTion Men, until today know to most in New Zealand as the ACT Party candidates. There have been several dance performances by various local dance groups but now it's time for the main event! The ACTion men will be performing a striptease, I've been told that there will no full monty at this stage so tough luck ladies!"

The music changes and tempo increases, the sold out stadium goes wild as the ACTion men make their way to the stage. Laughing and waving at the crowd

"Wow here they come and don't they look confident! I've heard they have been rehearsing this for the past few months let's see how they perform."

The ACTion Men have lined up on stage and as the music starts they begin to perform their routine, well timed and perfectly in sync with each other and the music. As they work done through their clothes the cheers from the crowd get louder and louder

"Wow, I'm blown away! Who would've thought politicians could be so suave and seductive, I'll tell you now ACT certainly aren't like other political parties and they definitely have my vote. The stadium is packed and I'm just getting a report now that at $5 per ticket ACT have raised $65,000 for local charities. Can you believe it."

As the ACTion Men finish their routine wearing nothing but barely there edible g-strings the crowd explodes in cheers and they cheekily tease the audience

"Well that's all from us tonight, I think if ACT lose this election they at least they have a fall back career to work on. The ladies in the crowd look ravenous I'm not sure they will even make it out alive"

How does the defeat of “Spartacus week” appear in the light of the above historical question? Was it a case of raging, uncontrollable revolutionary energy colliding with an insufficiently ripe situation, or was it a case of weak and indecisive action?

Both! The crisis had a dual nature. The contradiction between the powerful, decisive, aggressive offensive of the Berlin masses on the one hand and the indecisive, half-hearted vacillation of the Berlin leadership on the other is the mark of this latest episode. The leadership failed. But a new leadership can and must be created by the masses and from the masses. The masses are the crucial factor. They are the rock on which the ultimate victory of the revolution will be built. The masses were up to the challenge, and out of this “defeat” they have forged a link in the chain of historic defeats, which is the pride and strength of international socialism. That is why future victories will spring from this “defeat.”

“Order prevails in Berlin!” You foolish lackeys! Your “order” is built on sand. Tomorrow the revolution will “rise up again, clashing its weapons,” and to your horror it will proclaim with trumpets blazing:

I was, I am, I shall be!

Thank you very much Deputy Speaker and I rise to oppose the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. And in so doing I say to the Leader of the Opposition I will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. I will not. And the Government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. Not now, not ever.
The Leader of the Opposition says that people who hold sexist views and who are misogynists are not appropriate for high office. Well I hope the Leader of the Opposition has got a piece of paper and he is writing out his resignation. Because if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives, he needs a mirror. That's what he needs. Let's go through the Opposition Leader's repulsive double standards, repulsive double standards when it comes to misogyny and sexism. We are now supposed to take seriously that the Leader of the Opposition is offended by Mr Slipper's text messages, when this is the Leader of the Opposition who has said, and this was when he was a minister under the last government – not when he was a student, not when he was in high school – when he was a minister under the last government.
He has said, and I quote, in a discussion about women being under-represented in institutions of power in Australia, the interviewer was a man called Stavros. The Leader of the Opposition says “If it's true, Stavros, that men have more power generally speaking than women, is that a bad thing?”
And then a discussion ensues, and another person says “I want my daughter to have as much opportunity as my son.” To which the Leader of the Opposition says “Yeah, I completely agree, but what if men are by physiology or temperament, more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command?”

Thank you. Senator Hanson, no, we will not be banning the burka.

Senator Hanson, I am not going to pretend to ignore the stunt that you have tried to pull today by arriving in the Chamber dressed in a burka when we all know that you are not an adherent of the Islamic faith. I would caution and counsel you with respect to be very, very careful of the offence you may do to the religious sensibilities of other Australians.

We have about 500,000 Australians in this country of the Islamic faith. And the vast majority of them are law-abiding, good Australians. Senator Hanson, it is absolutely consistent with being a good, law-abiding Australian and being a strict, adherent Muslim.

Senator Hanson, for the last four years, I have had responsibility pre-eminently among the ministers subject to the Prime Minister for national security policy. And I can tell you, Senator Hanson, that it has been the advice of each director-general of security with whom I have worked and each commissioner of the Australian Federal Police with whom I have worked that it is vital for their intelligence and law-enforcement work that they work cooperatively with the Muslim community. And to ridicule that community, to drive it into a corner, to mock its religious garments is an appalling thing to do and I would ask you to reflect on what you have done.

Ladies and gentleman , well may we say God Save the Queen because nothing will save the Governor-General.

The proclamation which you have just heard read by the Governor-General’s official secretary was countersigned ‘Malcolm Fraser’ who will undoubtedly go down in Australian history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr’s cur.

They won’t silence the outskirts of Parliament House, even if the inside has been silenced for the next few weeks .

The Governor-General’s proclamation was signed after he already made an appointment to meet the Speaker at a quarter to five.

The House of Representatives had requested the Speaker to give the Governor-General its decision that Mr Fraser did not have the confidence of the House  and that the Governor-General should call me to form the Government. . . .

Maintain your rage and enthusiasm through the campaign for the election now to be held and until polling day.

The Representation of the People Act 2000 also introduced a new system of electoral registration, with 2 electoral registers, one for parliamentary elections, one for local elections:[121]

"A person is entitled to vote as an elector at a parliamentary election in any constituency if on the date of the poll he (...)(c) is either a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland"; "A person is entitled to be registered in the register of parliamentary electors for any constituency or part of a constituency if on the relevant date he (...) (c) is either a qualifying Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland"
"A person is entitled to vote as an elector at a local government election in any electoral area if on the date of the poll he (...)(c) is a Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or a relevant citizen of the Union"; "A person is entitled to be registered in the register of local government electors for any electoral area if on the relevant date he (...) (c) is a qualifying Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or a relevant citizen of the Union"
"In this section “qualifying Commonwealth citizen” means a Commonwealth citizen who either"
(a) is not a person who requires leave under the [1971 c. 77.] Immigration Act 1971 to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, or
(b) is such a person but for the time being has (or is, by virtue of any enactment, to be treated as having) any description of such leave"

The attorney-general throughout most of the 1930's, future prime minister Robert Menzies, visited Nazi Germany in 1938, and came home gushing about the “really spiritual quality in the willingness of the Germans to devote themselves to the service and well-being of the state”.

At the time of Menzies’ visit the Nuremberg laws had been in place for three years, meaning that Jews were no longer citizens and could neither vote in elections nor marry Germans. As late as 1939, prime minister Menzies was still declaring at public addresses: “History will label Hitler as one of the really great men of the century”.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Australia’s rulers found it easy to come to terms with dictatorial regimes, consciously endorsing repression and racism. Today, Turnbull isn’t just refusing to criticise the Trump administration for its racist new policies: he has sided with them.

An antifreeze is an additive which lowers the freezing point of a water-based liquid and increases its boiling point. An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments and also achieves boiling-point elevation ("anti-boil") to allow higher coolant temperature. Freezing and boiling points are colligative properties of a solution, which depend on the concentration of the dissolved substance.

Because water has good properties as a coolant, water plus antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes. Commercially, both the additive (pure concentrate) and the mixture (diluted solution) are called antifreeze, depending on the context. Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase, which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers.

Salts are frequently used for de-icing, but salt solutions are not used for cooling systems because they can cause severe corrosion to metals. Instead, non-corrosive antifreezes are commonly used for critical de-icing, such as for aircraft wings.

A LARGE NUMBER of high-profile MPs, Senators, media authorities, and government officials have become embroiled in the April Australiasim alternate account scandal dubbed ‘The Posideon Adventure’, as the undisclosed Royal Commission of Inquiry investigating the saga comes to a close.
The Australiasim Telegraph can reveal that the Commission, headed by experienced Commissioner and Greens member /u/LowKeyUsername has sat in secret since the day nearly 20 active participants of Australiasim simultaneously deleted their accounts leaving behind a plethora of unanswered questions from the shattered simulation. The Commission sat in secret so as not to jeopardise their investigations into persons known to delete their accounts under pressure.
The findings of the Commission have named numerous perpetrators directly and indirectly involved in the scandal; however, Commissioners such as /u/Dicky_Knee have said they are unlikely to face charges:
“There’s not a whole lot that our simulated government can do to those responsible…
“They are certainly never allowed to return, and we are working to warn other sims so that they cannot do this sort of thing again”.
A list of 17 names was examined by the Commission and a number of other names were linked. Despite this, the findings suggest that as little as four actual people were behind the scandal. The result of nearly 20 users disappearing has been devastating for Australiasim.
Commissioner /u/LowKeyUsername reported that it is likely that the culprits have done similar things to previous political simulations.
“I'm currently looking at 4 people connected, possibly a fifth…
“It’s clear that they like the electoral side of this stuff. They have never gone further than an election previously,” /u/LowKeyUsername said.

A LARGE NUMBER of high-profile MPs, Senators, media authorities, and government officials have become embroiled in the April Australiasim alternate account scandal dubbed ‘The Posideon Adventure’, as the undisclosed Royal Commission of Inquiry investigating the saga comes to a close.
The Australiasim Telegraph can reveal that the Commission, headed by experienced Commissioner and Greens member /u/LowKeyUsername has sat in secret since the day nearly 20 active participants of Australiasim simultaneously deleted their accounts leaving behind a plethora of unanswered questions from the shattered simulation. The Commission sat in secret so as not to jeopardise their investigations into persons known to delete their accounts under pressure.
The findings of the Commission have named numerous perpetrators directly and indirectly involved in the scandal; however, Commissioners such as /u/Dicky_Knee have said they are unlikely to face charges:
“There’s not a whole lot that our simulated government can do to those responsible…
“They are certainly never allowed to return, and we are working to warn other sims so that they cannot do this sort of thing again”.
A list of 17 names was examined by the Commission and a number of other names were linked. Despite this, the findings suggest that as little as four actual people were behind the scandal. The result of nearly 20 users disappearing has been devastating for Australiasim.
Commissioner /u/LowKeyUsername reported that it is likely that the culprits have done similar things to previous political simulations.
“I'm currently looking at 4 people connected, possibly a fifth…
“It’s clear that they like the electoral side of this stuff. They have never gone further than an election previously,” /u/LowKeyUsername said.

A LARGE NUMBER of high-profile MPs, Senators, media authorities, and government officials have become embroiled in the April Australiasim alternate account scandal dubbed ‘The Posideon Adventure’, as the undisclosed Royal Commission of Inquiry investigating the saga comes to a close.
The Australiasim Telegraph can reveal that the Commission, headed by experienced Commissioner and Greens member /u/LowKeyUsername has sat in secret since the day nearly 20 active participants of Australiasim simultaneously deleted their accounts leaving behind a plethora of unanswered questions from the shattered simulation. The Commission sat in secret so as not to jeopardise their investigations into persons known to delete their accounts under pressure.
The findings of the Commission have named numerous perpetrators directly and indirectly involved in the scandal; however, Commissioners such as /u/Dicky_Knee have said they are unlikely to face charges:
“There’s not a whole lot that our simulated government can do to those responsible…
“They are certainly never allowed to return, and we are working to warn other sims so that they cannot do this sort of thing again”.
A list of 17 names was examined by the Commission and a number of other names were linked. Despite this, the findings suggest that as little as four actual people were behind the scandal. The result of nearly 20 users disappearing has been devastating for Australiasim.
Commissioner /u/LowKeyUsername reported that it is likely that the culprits have done similar things to previous political simulations.
“I'm currently looking at 4 people connected, possibly a fifth…
“It’s clear that they like the electoral side of this stuff. They have never gone further than an election previously,” /u/LowKeyUsername said.

__**Baron Oats**__
Born Boris Obolensky, Baron Oats was an absolute unit, famous for his hunger for oats. He was a Social Democratic reformer, pressuring the Tsar to accept demands for liberalisation of the society and economy.
During the Russian Revolution of 1917, Baron Oats was executed by the Soviets for his gluttony and noble status.

__History__
*Early Life*
The Obolensky noble family (anglicised Oats) were a moderately powerful family in the Russian Empire. Their connections allowed Baron Oats to study at Moscow University, where he grew close to courtesans serving the Tsar. This allowed him significant influence, and in spite of his Pigged Face condition, he was able to become a member of the Tsar's inner circle in 1905.
*Death*
During the October Revolution, Oats was captured on the streets and forced to march by the Bolsheviks, who later executed him.

I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Liberal, is in fact, Liberal/National, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Liberal plus National. Liberal is not a stable government unto itself, but rather another political component of a fully functioning government made useful by the National voters, MPs and ministers comprising a full government as defined by the Constitution.

Many voters vote for a coalition version of the National Party every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of National which is widely seen today is often called “Liberal”, and many of its voters are not aware that it is basically the National Party, led by Michael McCormack. There really is a Liberal, and these voters are voting for it, but it is just a part of the coalition they support.

Liberal is the major partner: the centrepiece of the coalition that allocates the government’s ministries to the other MPs that you elect. The major partner is an essential part of a governing coalition, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete coalition. Liberal is normally used in combination with the National Party: the whole coalition is basically Liberal with National added, or Liberal/National. All the so-called “Liberal” voters are really supporters of Liberal/National.

So today in Spanish class, my teacher told us that we would be listening to a song in Spanish. Already, I began to tremble. I had a bad feeling about this. “Which one?” I ask shakily, not wanting to hear the answer. “Despacito” She responds. I begin to hyperventilate. My worst fears have been realized. I fade in and out of conciseness. I clamp my palms over my ears, but I know it’s futile. The song plays. I’m crying now, praying. God, Allah, Buddha please help me. I curl up on the floor. There’s nothing I can do now. And then it happens. The chorus plays. The girls in my class open their mouths. The screams of the damned, the shrieks of the tortured fill my ears and bounce around my skull. My eardrums rupture, blood leaking out. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I can only sit there, violently shaking as it happens to me. After what seems like hours, it’s finally over. I try to move, but I cannot make myself. My brain shuts down as my vision fades to black. I muster the last of my energy, uttering the accursed word.

“Despacito”

It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor has sat doing elections and shit on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of mankind by the will of the sim, and master of a million senate seats by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is an online personality writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Meme Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly get coc'd.

Yet even in his exam-studying state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Randoms cross the liberal-infested miasma of the discord, the only route between decent ideas, their way lit by the Astronomican, the words of the Emperor. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted channels. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Socialist Party, the left-wing, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Labor Party and countless sorta right wing people, the ever vigilant Wommel and the pagan-priests of the Vikings to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from alts, homophobes, LO - and worse.

To be a sim voter in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of democracy and Westminster for nobody runs in most places anymore. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only Dicky_Knee vs Rommel. There is no peace amongst the sim, only an eternity of memes and bi-elections, and the laughter of the thirsting Judiciary.

It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor has sat doing elections and shit on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the Master of mankind by the will of the sim, and master of a million senate seats by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is an online personality writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Meme Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly get coc'd.

Yet even in his exam-studying state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Randoms cross the liberal-infested miasma of the discord, the only route between decent ideas, their way lit by the Astronomican, the words of the Emperor. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted channels. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the Socialist Party, the left-wing, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Labor Party and countless sorta right wing people, the ever vigilant Wommel and the pagan-priests of the Vikings to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from alts, homophobes, LO - and worse.

To be a sim voter in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of democracy and Westminster for nobody runs in most places anymore. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only Dicky_Knee vs Rommel. There is no peace amongst the sim, only an eternity of memes and bi-elections, and the laughter of thirsting Judiciary.

@Deleted User Расцветали яблони и груши,

Поплыли туманы над рекой.

Выходила на берег Катюша,

На высокий берег на крутой.

Выходила, песню заводила

Про степного, сизого орла,

Про того, которого любила,

Про того, чьи письма берегла.

Ой ты, песня, песенка девичья,

Ты лети за ясным солнцем вслед.

И бойцу на дальнем пограничье

От Катюши передай привет.

Пусть он вспомнит девушку простую,

Пусть услышит, как она поет,

Пусть он землю бережет родную,

А любовь Катюша сбережет.

EXERPT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMPS DIARY:
"Dear Diary,
Today was a big day, I got to sit down with my crush one on one. Just the two of us. He was so big and powerful. I kept staring at the bulge in his pants. It was big. I wish he would grace me with the sight and let me suck it all night long. I would get mad at him for it, but I can't.
Mainly because he has a tape of Russian Hookers pissing on me in a Moscow hotel room.
Still, I want to have him to be mine and only mine. Whenever I'm around him, I feel so small and insignificant when I'm around such a big, strong man.

If only he would notice me.

Senpai.

Vladimir."

Delicious copypasta

I thank you for your question. We have cancelled a record number of visas, including for bikies, many of whom are involved on building sites, working for the CFMEU. They are the hired muscle. Everyone of course has a story of a CFMEU union thug turning up on a building site and running riot, but I heard an amazing story the other day. 

At a huge unit construction site in the city, a motorbike screeches to a halt outside the gates, the rider wearing his CFMEU-emblazoned jacket and a Rebels bikie tattoo across his forehead. He hops off and walks towards the lady on the stop and go sign at the entrance of the building site. She is a bit nervous, naturally enough, but tries to make him out; she left home in a rush that morning and could not find her contact lenses. 

'Julia!' the bikie says. She feels instant relief: it's Bill the bikie!

Julia is a part pensioner. She trusted her friend bikie Bill to find her this job after unexpectedly losing her last gig. It is two days a week, 150 grand a year—not a bad deal. The downside is that her CFMEU dues are $149,000 a year, which makes it a bit tight, but it helps to support her stay-at-home hubby. 

'You're doing a great job here, Julia', says Bill, sincerely. She feels secure because her friend bikie Bill has her back. But bikie Bill barges forward and sees his target: the foreman. It is Kevin the carpenter—as Kevin humbly says, 'Carpenter by trade, but future global leader by nature.'


[20-Aug-18 07:26 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
Anyway, Kevin is talking to a group of on-site workers—the cleaners. He is talking in Chinese, which is strange, because none of the workers in that group are Chinese. Bikie Bill knows the group well, because he did the deal for the cleaners' EBA: 5c an hour, he got for them. It makes things a bit tight for their families, but the cleaners are content, because they know that the balance of the $100 an hour in the pay deal that was done for them will go to the CFMEU professional development fund, which has millions—and growing—and that the US Teamsters training program will be properly funded to educate the new generation of CFMEU leadership in extortion and hand-to-hand combat. 

The moral of this story is that Julia can have a—Julia could not trust bikie Bill. Kevin could not trust bikie Bill. The workers could not trust bikie Bill. And let me tell you, the Australian people do not trust this Leader of the Opposition.

The river crab is a "harmonious" Mandarin homonym, a network language that comes out of the Chinese network. The Communist Party of China promotes a "harmonious society" policy. While shielding pornographic violence information, it also forcibly removes or blocks information that is not conducive to the rule of the Chinese Communist Party on the grounds of sabotaging social harmony and stability. For example, the special action of rectifying the Internet vulgarity [1] ]. In the database of Green Dam-Flower Escort, the political information required to be screened is nearly six times more than pornographic violence. [2] [3] If there is political sensitivity in the film, such as the taboo of the Republic of China flag, it will also be "harmonized."

A few minutes ago I spoke with Malcolm Turnbull to advise him I believed the majority of the party room no longer supported his leadership. Accordingly, I asked him to convene a party room meeting at which I would challenge for the leadership of the Parliamentary Liberal Party.

Last night, the PM left the liberal party and Sprite took over, greatly upsetting the right-left balance in the sim. This morning, Kaarian suddenly dissolved the RPA, and most RPA/ conservative figures left including Kaarian and Ikaora left the discord channel and deleted their reddit accounts.

Posideon then came on discord chat and told us he didn’t know what was going on, and he was investigating. He also randomly talked up Kaarrien’s eloquence. 

A short time later, he left the discord channel and no one can get a hold of him. 

The current theory is: Poseidon had Kaarrien, and other right-wing figures as his personal alt accounts and had secretly been fucking with all of us. This is unsubstantiated, and just a bunch of dicksheads speculating. Only a handful of people have left, but these are the mods and some party leaders/influential people, so everything is up in the air atm.

Since all mods have now left the sub, we are trying to reclaim ownership of the subreddits. However, Reddit is currently down, so we are unable to do so right now.

PREAMBLE

China is one of the countries with the longest histories in the world. The people of all nationalities in China have jointly created a splendid culture and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Feudal China was gradually reduced after 1840 to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. The Chinese people waged wave upon wave of heroic struggles for national independence and liberation and for democracy and freedom. Great and earth-shaking historical changes have taken place in China in the 20th century. The Revolution of 1911, led by Dr Sun Yat-sen, abolished the feudal monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China. But the Chinese people had yet to fulfil their historical task of overthrowing imperialism and feudalism. After waging hard, protracted and tortuous struggles, armed and otherwise, the Chinese people of all nationalities led by the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader ultimately, in 1949, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat capitalism, won the great victory of the new-democratic revolution and founded the People's Republic of China. Thereupon the Chinese people took state power into their own hands and became masters of the country.

After the founding of the People's Republic, the transition of Chinese society from a new- democratic to a socialist society was effected step by step. The socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production was completed, the system of exploitation of man by man eliminated and the socialist system established. The people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which is in essence the dictatorship of the proletariat, has been consolidated and developed.


[14-Oct-18 06:52 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have thwarted aggression, sabotage and armed provocations by imperialists and hegemonists,safeguarded China's national independence and security and strengthened its national defence. Major successes have been achieved in economic development. An independent and fairly comprehensive socialist system of industry has in the main been established. There has been a marked increase in agricultural production. Significant progress has been made in educational, scientific, cultural and other undertakings, and socialist ideological education has yielded noteworthy results. The living standards of the people have improved considerably. Both the victory of China's new-democratic revolution and the successes of its socialist cause have been achieved by the Chinese people of all nationalities under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and by upholding truth, correcting errors and overcoming numerous difficulties and hardships.

**The basic task of the nation in the years to come is to concentrate its effort on socialist modernization.** Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the guidance of Marxism- Leninism and Mao ZedongThought, the Chinese people of all nationalities will continue to adhere to the people's democratic dictatorship and follow the socialist road, steadily improve socialist institutions, develop socialist democracy, improve the socialist legal system and work hard and self-reliantly to modernize industry, agriculture, national defence and science and technology step by step to turn China into a socialist country with a high level of culture and democracy. The exploiting classes as such have been eliminated in our country.


[14-Oct-18 06:53 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
This united front will continue to be consolidated and developed. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a broadly representative organization of the united front, which has played a significant historical role and will continue to do so in the political and social life of the country, in promoting friendship with the people of other countries and in the struggle for socialist modernization and for the reunification and unity of the country. The People's Republic of China is a unitary multi-national state built up jointly by the people of all its nationalities. Socialist relations of equality, unity and mutual assistance have been established among them and will continue to be strengthened. In the struggle to safeguard the unity of the nationalities, it is necessary to combat big-nation chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism, and also necessary to combat local-national chauvinism. The state does its utmost to promote the common prosperity of all nationalities in the country. China's achievements in revolution and construction are inseparable from support by the people of the world. The future of China is closely linked with that of the whole world.

CHAPTER I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Article 1. The People's Republic of China is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. The socialist system is the basic system of the People's Republic of China. Sabotage of the socialist system by any organization or individual is prohibited.

Article 2. All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise state power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at different levels. The people administer state affairs and manage economic, cultural and social affairs through various channels and in various ways in accordance with the law.

Article 3. The state organs of the People's Republic of China apply the principle of democratic centralism. The National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at different levels are instituted through democratic election. They are responsible to the people and subject to their supervision. All administrative, judicial and procuratorial organs of the state are created by the people's congresses to which they are responsible and under whose supervision they operate. The division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs is guided by the principle of giving full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under the unified leadership of the central authorities.

The state helps the areas inhabited by minority nationalities speed up their economic and cultural development in accordance with the peculiarities and needs of the different minority nationalities. Regional autonomy is practised in areas where people of minority nationalities live in compact communities; in these areas organs of self- government are established for the exercise of the right of autonomy. All the national autonomous areas are inalienable parts of the People's Republic of China. The people of all nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages, and to preserve or reform their own ways and customs.

Article 5. The state upholds the uniformity and dignity of the socialist legal system. No law or administrative or local rules and regulations shall contravene the constitution.

utilitarianism is the normative ethical theory which views that the morality of an action is decided by the consequences of that action. An action is moral if it creates the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. Happiness is defined as pleasure and the absence of pain. This view is often expressed with the aphorism the ends justify the means.
Kantian Ethics is the normative ethical theory which views that the morality of an action is decided by the intention with which the action is performed and the nature of the action. the consequences are irrelevant. an action is good if the intention behind it is good. An intention is good if it comes from our sense of duty. Our duty is determined by our reason and should follow two basic principles. The principle of categorical imperative and the principle of never using another person as a means to an end. The principle of categorical imperative should pass the test of universalisability: "Act only according to maxims which you will to become universal law" and the principle of never using others as a means to an end is based on the idea that all human beings should be treated with respect as they are rational and free.
According to Kant, Tina's action is immoral. Her intention, to steal a handful of flowers from a public park (she did not own or pay for the flowers, and simply took them), is bad as it fails the test of universalisability. If everyone stole, the concept of property would cease to exist. 
According to a utilitarian, tina's action was moral. As the result of her action, more people benefit. The people who come to Tina's house will be viewing a more pleasant residence than if she hadn't taken the flowers to decorate her place, and the happiness they will get from it is greater than the unhappiness caused by the flowers being missing, as they may very well not be noticed or missed.

Its true. Sorry guys. My starboard score is no more, and with that my resolve is gone. 3,000 hours of work, grinding day in day out to get those stars. I worked so damn hard only to get a slap in the face from the one who birthed me. How fucking sad. I immediately dm’d FTMP asking for assistance, and was met with no response. I felt defeated. I felt worthless. The real world was too much for me and my stars were calling to me. My messages needed to be starred and my ego was crying in pain. Why did she damn me? Why would she do this to me, her own former co-leader? I feel betrayed. I know health man would never do this to me. Tonight I will summon Triangle in her room in hopes to scare her into submission. I need my life back.

I cured my son of the Big Gay. The other day, he came home for Christmas with his new partner. I was excited to meet her (and maybe MEAT her after my son fell asleep hehe), but imagine my horror when it turned out to be another man.

I immediately started to protest, but my son said "Dad, this is who I am. Zander and I are in love."

Without missing a beat, I turned around and said, "You forgot to say no homo."

But my boy simply scoffed at me and said, "Actually, dad, I AM a homosexual. That's right, your son is in love with another man." Then my son grabbed Zander's hand and looked at me defiantly.

For a second, I was utterly devastated. But then I thought to myself What would Trump do? So I stared straight at my son, penetrating his soul with my eyes (no homo), and said, "But that's gay."

As soon as I uttered those fateful words, my son began to convulse. He dropped to floor in some sort of manic state, spit pouring from his mouth as his eyes rolled back into his head. Zander tried to help him, but I pushed that dainty little queer away with my heteronormative strength.

After a full minute, my son opened his eyes and said, "Dad, you cured me of my homosexuality." Then, with manly tears of joy in his eyes, he pointed to Zander and exclaimed, "Let's get that homo!"

After we wiped Zander's blood off our hands and threw the little fairy into the cold, my son and I sat down with a beer and watched some football.

As we watched, my son turned to me and said, "Dad, I love you. No homo."

"No homo indeed, son," I replied. "No homo indeed."

On the morning of the 1st of January 2019, we lost former Queensland Young Nationals President, Paul Neville. Paul served Australia for 20 years as the Federal Member for Hinkler. 

He survived tight election after tight election and bucked every national swing. Paul understood that our side of politics is always about putting locals before Canberra and he was rewarded for doing so by his constituents at every election he contested. 

Vale Paul Neville. A great Australian with a famous patio - open for anyone who will stop by and listen to some of his favourite gags and stories. A loving husband to Margaret and an ever devoted father and grandfather, our thoughts are with his family during this difficult time.

PREAMBLE

China is one of the countries with the longest histories in the world. The people of all nationalities in China have jointly created a splendid culture and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Feudal China was gradually reduced after 1840 to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. The Chinese people waged wave upon wave of heroic struggles for national independence and liberation and for democracy and freedom. Great and earth-shaking historical changes have taken place in China in the 20th century. The Revolution of 1911, led by Dr Sun Yat-sen, abolished the feudal monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China. But the Chinese people had yet to fulfil their historical task of overthrowing imperialism and feudalism. After waging hard, protracted and tortuous struggles, armed and otherwise, the Chinese people of all nationalities led by the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader ultimately, in 1949, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat capitalism, won the great victory of the new-democratic revolution and founded the People's Republic of China. Thereupon the Chinese people took state power into their own hands and became masters of the country.

After the founding of the People's Republic, the transition of Chinese society from a new- democratic to a socialist society was effected step by step. The socialist transformation of the private ownership of the means of production was completed, the system of exploitation of man by man eliminated and the socialist system established. The people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, which is in essence the dictatorship of the proletariat, has been consolidated and developed.

Last night, the PM left the liberal party and Sprite took over, greatly upsetting the right-left balance in the sim. This morning, Kaarian suddenly dissolved the RPA, and most RPA/ conservative figures left including Kaarian and Ikaora left the discord channel and deleted their reddit accounts.

Posideon then came on discord chat and told us he didn’t know what was going on, and he was investigating. He also randomly talked up Kaarrien’s eloquence. 

A short time later, he left the discord channel and no one can get a hold of him. 

The current theory is: Poseidon had Kaarrien, and other right-wing figures as his personal alt accounts and had secretly been fucking with all of us. This is unsubstantiated, and just a bunch of dicksheads speculating. Only a handful of people have left, but these are the mods and some party leaders/influential people, so everything is up in the air atm.

Since all mods have now left the sub, we are trying to reclaim ownership of the subreddits. However, Reddit is currently down, so we are unable to do so right now.

I saw Bill Shorten in a grocery store in Melbourne today. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn't want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, "Oh, like you're doing now?"
I was taken aback, and all I could say was "Huh?" but he kept cutting me off and going "huh? huh? huh?" and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw Bill trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like "Sir, you need to pay for those first." At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually "to prevent any electrical infetterence," and then turned around and winked at me. I don't even think that's a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

"Your body is sacred & unique" You are far more precious than gold, diamonds and pearls, and you should be covered too."So he added that, if you keep your treasured mineral just like gold, diamond and pearls, deeply covered up, a reputable mining organization with the requisite machinery will fly down and conduct years of extensive exploration.
First, they will contact your government (family), sign professional contracts (wedding) and mine you professionally( legal marriage).But if you leave your precious minerals uncovered on the surface of the earth, you always attract a lot of illegal miners to come and mine you illegally. Everybody will just pick up their crude instruments and just have a dig on you just freely like that. Keep your bodies deeply covered so that it invite professional miners to chase you.

When I (male) was about 6 or 7 years old, my sister's (female) beagle jumped up and licked ("kissed") my face and on the lips. This was at a time when I thought kissing makes people pregnant. So naturally I thought I got pregnant. Need I remind you that I am male and it was a dog. So, I had my first pregnancy scare at 7. With a dog. And I'm male. I checked my poop every day for next few weeks looking for puppies.

Hang on, weren't you deputy leader of the exact same party you criticise here when you agreed to slash Migration? Your entire record is Right Wing, you were a previous Leader of the National Party, you were the most senior member of the second greatest in number party in a National-led Government, and yet here you are in the Labour Party, it seems that when you left Reform, you lost your honesty. Or perhaps you never had any to begin with. Sickening.

Ok so we can ~supposedly~ see the Great Wall of China from space even though it's only as wide as a footpath and yet six-lane highways cannot be seen from space. Something doesn't add up here and I feel like the Chinese may have something to do with it.

...prepared in innocence to meet our king of glory
And so we have this
You have it in your secret windows
And you're understanding to understand it and to bring it forth
It takes minute detail
It takes a holy life
It takes emotions
It takes dedication
It takes dedication
It takes a death
And only God can allow it
And you couldn't do it if you're not the seed of God
And so the path through the great corridors
These are corridors unto his perfection
That is which the prophet and the Urim and Thummim has penetrated
That through this great sea of blackness
That I penetrated through these corridors
And I went through that last segment
Where I went through these dark serpentines
I passed through that corridor
Where they sat, where they are
And when you penetrate to the most high God
You will believe you are mad
You will believe you've gone insane
But I tell you if you follow the secret window
And you die to the ego nature
You will penetrate this darkness
Oh yes there's many a man or woman
That's been put in the insane asylum
When this has happened to them
And they're sitting there today, people think they're insane
But they saw something that's real
And they see it when they're on drugs
The only thing is they see it
Not through the light of God, and the way I show you
I show you to see it through the light of God
And the understanding of God
Because when you see the face of God, you will die
And there will be nothing left of you
Except the God-man, the God-woman
The heavenly man, the heavenly woman
The heavenly child
There'll be prayer on your lips day and night
There'll be a song of jubilee waiting for your king
There will be nothing you will not be be looking for in this world
Except in for your god


[18-Jan-19 10:47 AM] silicon#4729
This is all a dream
A dream in death
And so I went through that window
And the tower of hell and the great serpentines of the highest order
And I went through that when I showed you chart #3
The question is asked and learned and someone who can turn this gift, this horrible gift of mine reclaimed
Or in front of me you can ask me a question
If it's asked, from the right being or the right soul out of Urim and Thummim
I can give you unspoken words that's never been spoken, it's not in your bible
Yet, it does clarify what is spoken in the bible...

It was Coney Island. They called Coney Island, "the playground of the world." There was no place like it, in the whole world, like Coney Island when I was a youngster. No place in the world like it, and it was so fabulous. Now it's shrunk down to almost nothing, you see. And, uh, I still remember in my mind how things used to be, and uh, you know, I feel very bad. But people from all over the world came here. From all over the world, it was the playground -- they called it the playground of the world, over here. Anyways, uh, I... uh... you know... I even got -- when I was very small, I even got lost at Coney Island, but they found me. On the, on the beach. And we used to sleep on the beach here, sleep overnight. They don't do that anymore. Things changed, you see. They don't sleep anymore on the beach

Madam speaker,

Australians know who I am and where I come from. They know I love my family and I love Australia.

In 1918 my father, at the age of nine, went to see a silent movie. By the time he was 14 he was producing and starring in his first movie. He went on to become the world’s youngest movie producer, as he was known in the United States. He returned to Australia to establish radio station 3AK in Melbourne and 7UV in Tasmania. Prime Minister Joseph Lyons, leader of the United Australia Party, opened 3AK and I still have the recording.

My mother was born in Penguin, Tasmania. She left in 1940 to work in ammunition production in Melbourne.

My family members have served this nation in the First and Second World Wars, some giving their life for Australian freedom. My nephew, squadron leader Martin Brewster, served with INTERFET in East Timor. All of them have done more than I could ever do.

Like half of all Australians, I lost my first partner Sue. Her love, our children Michael and Emily, sustain me every day. My wife Anna and my lovely five year old daughter Mary, or middle five, as she says, remind me every day what life is all about and the love we have for each other. I look forward to the coming weeks when I will again be a father.

I have a strong resolve to serve our nation. I have a strong resolve not to let the people of Fairfax down. Fairfax has been taken for granted for many years. My election is a reminder to major parties that they must truly serve all Australians.

We meet today in a city which in itself reconciled our people at difficult times in the nation’s history, a city which, in this century and the last, has been witness to the trials and tribulations of our people, at a time when the nation lacks direction and needs to set sail on a new course.

How long can parliament remain indifferent to Australians’ needs? How long can government be deaf to the everyday struggles of Australians? They must be on top of the agenda.


[18-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
On this small speck in the universe, planet Earth, we must do what we can to help each other. Our main concern needs to rest with how we can grow and expand our economy and create more wealth. Not wealth for the wealthy, but for all, even the least among us. As a wise man once said: “An injustice to a man anywhere, is an injustice to all men everywhere.”

We live in a nation where the roads are no longer safe, where ambulances remove the carnage from our highways, where the infant mortality rate of our indigenous people is twice that of the Australian community, where the life expectancy of many of our poorer and downtrodden citizens is less than it should be, where health services are declining, where our elderly and veterans are forgotten, where the tyranny of distance separates the hopes and aspirations of remote Australia, where despair of the homeless and unemployed robs the nation of the productivity of our citizens. Tasmanians feel abandoned by mainland Australia.

The ghosts of the Anzacs call us to action.

To stimulate our economic activity we must ignite the creativity of all our citizens. Chairman Mao once said that “women hold up half the sky.” Women received the vote in 1902 but prejudice still remains. Leadership, not complacency, is our need today. In parliament, in Cabinet, we need more women.

The nation needs a strong economy with efficient production. Australia still has a triple-A credit rating. The decline in Queensland’s credit rating has been followed by a decline in services. Our citizens need to live a civilized life. Government is not business. It’s about creating the environment to allow our economy to flourish, to grow revenue, to sustain the nation and to provide income and security to all Australians. Confidence is low. Our standard of living has declined. We must use resources better.


[18-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
We are not prisoners to the world economy, drifting helplessly on a sea of despair. The problems we have were made by Australians, and can be solved by Australians. We should not accept defeat by just cutting and slashing, lest the reaper reaps more than he can sow. Borrowing to avoid the day is not a solution.

Let’s set a national agenda for growth and a goal for all of us.

When the day comes, and it most surely will, when citizens elected by the people take proper and full responsibility for the welfare of their fellow citizens, when we treat other Australians as we would want them to treat us, then we can surely know that we do God’s will.

Public service has no reward other than the service of others. It’s the legacy we leave future generations. History is our real judge. Let us work together, not as opponents but as colleagues joined by time and space to serve the nation.

Australians have lost hope in the future. Change is certain. Success reflects our ability to adapt to change. It’s not individuals or personalities that are important. It’s not demeaning comments about those who have offered to serve. The challenge is what we can do to make life better.

At the last election the Palmer United Party won 5.5 per cent of the vote, becoming Australia’s fourth largest party. The Prime Minister became Prime Minister because the Coalition received Palmer United preferences. Palmer United outpolled the Nationals. Palmer United had one member elected in the House of Representatives and three Senators, only to have the AEC lose ballot boxes to deny Dio Wang election in Western Australia. The Palmer United Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party will hold the balance of power in the Senate. In WA our polling is showing we will win two senators if an election is held. In Fairfax, Palmer United received one of the largest swings in the nation’s history of 50.03 per cent.


[18-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Murdoch’s Newspoll showed “others” as being 12.4 per cent, consistent with our own polling of 10 per cent, nearly twice as much as we received at the election. Many Australians believed that a vote for the Palmer United Party was a wasted vote. Now our party vote has solidified.

I want to thank all 150 candidates who stood in every seat available in the House of Representatives and our Senate teams, and our party members in every state and territory.

Political courage is one of the rarest commodities. Our Queensland leader, Dr Alex Douglas, and his deputy, Carl Judge, have defended freedom and the rights of Australians by putting principle before political expediency.

The entrenchment of the two party system in this country not only threatens democracy, it destroys the creativity of the nation. It robs from all of us the benefit of each other’s ideas and innovation.

The forward estimates for August 2013 projected provisional tax receipts for 2014 would exceed $70 billion. Instead of companies paying tax quarterly based on an estimate we need to let them pay it yearly on companies and businesses’ actual results. If we keep $70 billion in enterprises’ hands they can spend it better than the Government. Australia will create real demand, massive job growth, reduce unemployment and turbo charge our economy. If $70 billion is spent by individual taxpayers, the Government receives 10 per cent GST. The Government receives $7 billion every time it’s spent by our citizens. The Government will receive the $70 billion at the end of each year. This means more hospitals, schools and a rising living standard. Increased wealth and revenue means we can make Australians’ lives better. At a current interest rate it will cost around $800 million a year but generate billions of dollars each year for the nation. We must stimulate domestic demand.


[18-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Government is the top petitioner of bankruptcy and company liquidations. As a result of business closures employees lose their jobs. We lose group tax, company tax, exports and GST. Stop Government driving business to the wall. Let’s keep people employed. Transferring people from gainful employment to unemployment just guarantees misery. Let’s find a better way, such as Chapter 11 in the US. The loss of only one year’s income due to unemployment is more than the total cost of five years education through high school. To neglect education performance is not only bad policy, it is bad economics.

Our army, navy and air force personnel protect and defend us all. We must link all service pensions to male total average earnings, expand all gold card benefits to peacekeepers and gold card benefits to spouses.

We need to support regional Australia by reintroducing a zonal taxation system. Regional areas need doctors and professionals. Regional industries benefit all of Australia. We have to end the discrimination against rural industries allowing them to compete.

If Australians are satisfied that what their Government is doing now is enough, is adequate, for Australia and our future, Australians can accept their lot. But as Australia’s future, security and freedoms steadily erode, we have to act. This nation has the strength and the potential to live out its heritage, to fulfil the dreams of the Anzacs, to return Australia to a lucky country, to restore our economy, to reclaim our national heritage.

Many people say they care, but they don’t. Parliament should be about the needs of others, but sometimes it’s not. In Queensland the Mulga is dying, drought and flood have combined to wreak havoc on the families of the region. How can we not act? How can we complain about animal welfare overseas when we let thousands of cattle die a slow and painful death? How can we let Australian families suffer?


[18-Jan-19 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Are we so indifferent to our fellow Australians? It’s our responsibility to be the last sentry at the gate to protect the rights and freedoms of all Australians.

Australia needs a revolution in the way we think, in the way we boost our wealth and economy for all our citizens.

We have to re-establish confidence. We need to believe we can lift our economy to a better future. We need to have a positive attitude. We may not win. We may not get there. But nothing is surer that we will fail if we don’t project positively.

Public service and political life must be the highest calling. The catch cry in this place needs to be respect for ideas. Great debate always demands its victim and truth is the only winner. But we are all winners when truth prevails over injustice. The content of our character is more important than how much money we have.

We need to praise the incorruptibility of our public officials, the integrity of our marriages and the worth of our people.

It’s ideas that matter. Governments may come and go, ideas go on forever. It’s ideas that will shape the nation. Ideas endure through time, when we are gone and forgotten. In history, in commerce, in politics, it’s ideas that capture the conscience of the nation. It’s ideas that endure when all else is gone.

Let us unite to serve the nation we love, to discover our future, to share our trials and tribulations, to overcome adversity, to pull together for our common good under the Southern Cross, and to know as a great man once said: “that on this earth God’s work must truly be our own.”

The existence of the N-word pass is proof of the violation of human rights and freedom of speech in our current generation. People, regardless of ethnicity, race, skin colour, political and socio-economic status should hold the right to say the N-word despite it being restricted to only those with a dark skin tone. Why should the amount of melanin present in someones skin at birth dictate whether they are born with the "n-word" privilege at birth? In the past it was unthinkable to think that women should be allowed to vote, and gay couples were in hiding in fear of becoming disowned by society, but all that has changed in just the past 100 years. Now I am not saying by all means you should target black people, as a violent protest would only regress us back to the times where we would basically fall as low as KKK-Clansmen scum, but a peaceful protest so all types of people can exist in a world where everyone can say the N-word in a non-malicious context similar to how we call people with red-heads "gingers" in our present day. Thank you for listening to my speech. I hope this helps uplift humanity into a greater generation of peace and prosperity.

Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.

To hit, or not to hit. Dost thou ever miss? I suppose it not. You have a male love interest, yet I would wager he does not kiss thee (Ye olde mwah). Furthermore; he will find another lass like he won't miss thee. And at the end of it all. He is going to skrrt, and he will hit that dab, as if he were the man known by the name of Wiz Khalifa

Guys I really wanted to believe that Virginia Western was not the cesspool of morons all my fellow biology faculty told me it would be. Unfortunately your finals, which I purposely made as easy as humanly possible, tanked harder than a Kardashian marriage. I personally apologise for expecting the bare minimum from you as students. If you look at your grade book you will notice that you all have gotten a 50 point grade bump as 'extra credit' and no this was not because any of you deserved it but it was infact so I don't get my ass fired when the dean asks me 'hey why the fuck did 50% of your class fail an introductory biology class' to whom I will reply 'hmm I don't know maybe its because these klingons are 18 years old and still giggle every time I say the term 'phagocytosis'. I'd like to add that in fact one of you got a 5/100 on this exam for which I salute you. Considering this was 100% multiple choice and the statistical probability of you missing more than 90% GUESSING is actually higher than your chances of getting laid, which for this student would be an act of God (please stay out of the gene pool you know who you are). I could have actually taken a shit on the scantron, wiped it off on the grass, and I am pretty certain my feces could have picked up more correct answers than you deliberately bubbled in. So congratulations, on making me lose faith in the public school system, and in humanity.

I fucking hate Stuart Little. I know what you’re thinking, this is some kind of funny joke, but no. Stuart Little is a piece of shit. A damn rat got picked over actual children at an orphanage and he’s supposed to be a hero? And I can’t even tell you how many damn times I’ve seen a great parking space only to turn the corner and realise Stuart Little is already parked there in his stupid little fucking convertible. He took my wife and the kids and my house and my job. I swear to fucking god, I’m going to kill myself and take that goddamn rodent to hell with me. Stuart Little has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable mouse in the street, and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking rat gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the mousefucker didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the white devil that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Stuart. All the people you’ve wronged will rise against you.

What pisses me the fuck of about it is how fucking nonsensical the lyrics are, the guy is saying that he wants different characters and the girl is saying that she already is ALL the characters that the guy suggests, how in the everloving fuck does that make sense?? You can't be several characters at once! Or is the girl supposed to be different people every time she answers?? And another thing, when he suggests Bastion, she says that they should NERF Bastion which implies that he is an OP character, which would be a reason FOR picking Bastion, not the other way around. It's such fucking nonsense and it pisses me off

Howdy, my name is Rawhide Kobayashi. I'm a 27 year old Japanese Japamerican (western culture fan for you foreigners). I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle's hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!

We all know Gru is the godly height of 14.5 feet tall and can move at a speed of 200 Meters per second. Based on average dick size, Gru’s penis is around 14 inches long. Also, Gru’s dick would weigh around 2 pounds considering the average weight of a dick is .77 lbs. If he swung his dick in a circular manner, it would have the centripetal acceleration of 72.57 meters per second. This means that gru can dickslap with the immense energy of 11,421 pounds per sq inch at a tip speed greater than 584415.58336974 MPH. In conclusion, Gru’s dickslap has enough energy to smash through 6” reinforced concrete and will cause a thunderclap as his dick breaks the sound barrier. I rest my case.

Jk, I further my case by pointing out The avg speed of ejaculate is 28 mph. This means that gru can ejaculate at a speed of roughly 70 MPH when standing still. If he decides to fling his ejaculate by swinging his dick in a circular fashion, it will travel at 584415.5*70= 40,909,085 mph. This means Gru’s ejaculate travels at a speed greater than 24 thousand times the speed of a bullet. Considering the average mass of ejaculate, 3.5 g, gru’s semen will impact the target with the energy of 1.715e9 Jouls, or roughly the amount of energy released in 667 pounds of TNT. In conclusion, if gru decided to weaponize his penis, he could easily conquer the world.

Now I rest my case

Today I attempted to insert a whole cantaloupe melon into my anus because the local shops had run out of apricots (I buy a lot). Using about a gallon of butter, breathing techniques and a few hours I managed to finally get it inside. However it was too uncomfortable so I tried to shit it back out.

This is where things got confusing because rather than a melon sliding out half a dozen apricots did. Now there is a chance that I just blacked out upon excreting the cantaloupe and it rolled away somewhere and that I happened to have a dozen or so left over apricots lying around my rectum from earlier but I cannot for the life of me find the melon anywhere.

I think I may have the power to anally turn melons into apricots. Further experimentation will be required of course (once my rectum has recovered) but if this turns out to be true then I may be able to solve world hunger.

I laughed, and proceeded to name all 802 Pokemon, what levels they evolve at, when they learn all of their moves, what all of the moves do, every Pokédex entry and their current most meta smogon build. With every new fact his body decomposed at a faster and faster rate, until he was nothing more than a pound of dirt. But I was not feeling merciful that day. I used a max revive on him, and proceeded to cause every one of not only his bones, but everyone within 18 generations of him’s bones to dissolve into a fine powder (including mine) He begged me to stop but I kept going. I recounted every piece of rule 34 Pokemon art to date, along with its exact time of creation and what specific fetishes it appeals to, no matter how niche. I then proceeded to jerk off to each and every one right there in front of him. So yeah I guess you could say I’m a Pokémon master. 😎

Domminate the room, do what i do, get one of those 15L water cooler bottles and bring it to class slung over one shoulder, slam that motherfucker on the ground in the aisle.

Everytime you feel a little thirsty stand up, lift the bottle to your mouth with both arms, make sure you spill plenty of water over yourself and the floor every time you do, also, let out a deep, loud, exhalation of satisfaction after every sip, then finish the routine by slamming the bottle on the ground again before loudly saying, "pfew, I needed that, I was getting a bit THIRSTY" yell thirsty as loud as you can.

When class finishes, pick up the bottle in such a way that the remainder pours out as you leave the room.

Let's say for argument's sake, Thanos cannot just use the stones to get rid of poop in his intestine or magically clean his ass. Most people wouldn't be comfortable using their non dominant hand to wipe their ass. It would be too awkward. Using his left hand is a no-no in this scanario. Would he wipe with the gauntlet on? What if the toilet paper breaks? Thanos would walk around with poop hands. The infinity poop gauntlet. Ew. The hulk would laugh at him.

Let's say he takes off the gauntlet and puts it on the counter. That would make him vulnerable, wouldn't it? Maybe this was the one outcome that Dr. Strange saw in 14,000,605. Spiderman swoops in, steals the gauntlet and toodles out of there without getting a sniff of Thanos poop. The rest of the Avengers cast would then swoop in and beat him senseless atop the toilet bowl. Ass unwiped.

What happens in the other 14,000,604 possibilities though? Thanos could own a japanese styled bidet toilet seat. The kind that would jet your ass with lukewarm water warmed to your body's temperature, then dry your ass with the loving warmth of a mother. Thanos would never have to take of his glove to wipe his ass. His ass would be sparkly clean without him needing to lift a finger. To think that Japanese technology would be the undoing of the avengers. Who woulda thunk it.

Step 1: Go into YouTube and turn on Dark Theme This is very important guys. You always want to have Dark Theme on.

Step 2: Go to the White House Mr. Obama will be waiting for you at the White House. Don't take Public Transit. Take a car like a fucking normal person

Step 3: Recieve the N Word Pass Yep. You've done it. You've got the N word pass. Now you can say the n word whenever you want. Good job

Thanks everyone for watching. Please like and subscribe and turn on the notification bell to be part of my super amazing wowie-you-did-it notification constipation situation squad. I hope this worked. Please write down in the comments if it didn't

Thank you 😉

I had just got done randomly browsing the internet where I'd come across some weird articles on how to make clothing out of plastic grocery bags. Things like this or this. I remember thinking, "Wow. How trashy." and didn't think much else of it. Later that night, I was browsing some of Reddit's various GoneWild subs. If you are unfamiliar, those are subs where Redditors can post nudes of themselves. That's all you really need to know about it. Obviously, they are NSFW which is why I'm not linking to any of them. One girl in particular I found incredibly adorable and wrote her a comment on her picture. I like to comment on GoneWild posts because complimenting the girls is a self-esteem boost for them and sometimes they reply and we have fun little conversations. It's an all around good time as long as you're respectful and aren't a creep about it. So anyhow, I go to comment on this girl's picture and I immediately flashback to the plastic bag clothing. I thought to myself, "This girl is so adorably cute that I bet she could wear those plastic bag dresses and it would take nothing away from her." Instead, what I actually posted was "You would look cute even wrapped in plastic bags."

I could end this right there. The words speak for themselves. That's enough of a TIFU, I think. But it got worse. She replied with something along the lines of "That's not terrifying or anything." and I immediately realized my fuck up. I tried explaining the plastic clothing to her and I don't think she was buying it. The next day I saw that she had deleted her entire Reddit account. I've not seen her back under a new username. I really must have scared her off.

For as long as I can remember ive always enjoyed growing my nails, only to peel them off again. Ive always thought that they would be tasty, and ive tried eating them both raw and cooked(although i never ate the cooked ones; the smell put me off) I didnt really like the taste and whenever I say "toenails" or whatever out loud it seems disgusting, but they seem tasty in my head for example: melting them down and drinking them, i think of what they would taste like and how delicous they are. 

once i had a huge pile of them sitting next to my bed. the longest one ive had so far was a about half an inch. 

I try to grow them as long as possible while withstanding the urge to peel them. I usually focus on my large toes toenail, as that seems to yield the most reward. And i get sudden urges to cut them(my saliva tastes different, i cant stop thinking about peeling my toenails, it clogs up my mind) especially the cutting and peeling part, just writing this is making the bile in my mouth taste like what i would think the nails would taste like. but even if ive cut all my nails down to the point there almost bleeding i still have a need to cut them. 

Can anyone relate to this or help me stop needing to constantly peel them. (certain words like peel give me a need to cut them).

You’re poisoning this young girl’s mind by bringing her to politically charged events. Your confession came loud and clear: I indoctrinated my daughter to the point where she thinks being straight is a bad thing. I hope you know you’ve fucked up any hope she has of becoming a functioning member of society, and that your political leniencies will only create more problems for her than good.

Q gets up on the stage, and addresses the audience Good morning everyone. I would like to ask everyone to face the direction of the ocean. Go ahead, do it. I want you to look at the waves as they crash on the sand. Those waves are going to sallow this city one day. And that “some day” is going to come a lot sooner than we think if we don’t take action against it. Here is the fact of the matter: climate change is real, and it’s going to affect everyone one. And it’s going to take everyone take care of it. You, the people, have been asked to take responsibility for the global warming crisis. You have been forced to take up the responsibility of “doing your part”. But what about large industry? What about the government? Has they truly been doing their part to tackle this crisis? No. No they have not. It’s time to end this foolishness. It’s time to hold those in power accountable. It’s time to stop calling for action, and to take action! It’s time for a green, efficient Australia. It’s time to expand the job market. It’s time for a Global Green Deal! A deal that we Australians will lead! Thank you. Leaves Stage

imagine being suddenly buried alive, your just sitting there and suddenly your pushed to the ground probably in an uncomfortable position with some snapped limbs depending how you fell, but that doesnt matter because the compression and weight are pushing down on you, you exhale but you cant inhale, you cant breath even if you wanted to, you cant move anything your surrounded by 2 tons of blackness, you cant stop the grit and sand fall down into your nostrils and mouth as your life ebbs away from you, you have an intense primal need to struggle but you cant even twitch as you die.

The Division of Cowper is an Australian electoral division in New South Wales. It was created for the March 2019 election. By far the largest electorate in the state and taking up most of the area west of the Great Dividing Range, many consider it the successor to the abolished Division of Lyne. The division is named after Charles Cowper, 2nd Premier of New South Wales.

It's largest population centre is Tweed Heads, on the far north coast. It also contains the towns of Dubbo, Lismore, Ballina, Coffs Harbour, Tamworth, Mildura, Broken Hill, Grafton and others.

Holy shit you just grossly misunderstood me
the idea that you should cause harm to reduce future harm is utilitarian and grossly shitty. I am literally arguing that if you have to engage in the behaviour you're trying to stop in order to stop said bad behaviour it's fundamentally fucked. You can judge a persons unsalavaglability by listening to what I said, if they can't be civilised and see reason through conventional methods (ie not being a dick to them) then they are not worth your effort at that moment in time. And to further prove my point you raise an excellent example! People who you once regarded as dicks you can now have conversations with because rather than be shitty to them until they reformed, you went off, they got more receptive to being reasonable, you came back and were polite and you can now have informed, reasonable and polite conversations with them.

1) then you dont understand the debates about fully simmed at all


[03-Apr-19 08:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
2) advocates of fully simmed have said repeatedly they want it because it will exclude non-centrists and make it harder for them to get seats

Now I'm no scientist but I've always wondered why he's so fast and after studying his races for 6 weeks I've come to the conclusion that its because he runs with a boner and here's why. So aerodynamically speaking a boner cuts through the wind resistance better than a flabby dick a flabby dick acts almost like a parachute adding wind resistance to the runner thus slowing him down. But Usain runs with boner thus acting like a spear cutting through the wind making the wind have the smallest affect on him. Where as his opponents flabby dicks slow them down. I do believe he uses performance enhancing drugs (viagra) to get and keep these race winning boners. Thank you for taking the time to read my research paper

Lmao. This is a discord server where young people come here to talk about politics. I am happy to sit down with a moderator if you think that I had anything to do with a journalist finding your details but don’t be too surprised, your running for a public position and it is expected. Like I said, I haven’t done anything wrong, I’ve never contacted any media nor will I do so and I won’t be apologizing for the actions of journalism

So after the events of infinity war Thanos returned to his 'garden', that place that was visible in infinity war when he described what he'd do after he finished his work. The remaining Avengers decide to get revenge and take the fight to him. What they didn't expect though: When they arrived on that garden planet, they found Thanos completely nude. He decided to put up his armor as a scarecrow in the garden. He was cheerfully jacking it while watering the plants when the Avengers arrived. When I saw that scene in the cinema, I must say, I was shocked at the realism of Thanos' computer generated cock. Honestly, it was unreal. You could see his veins and shit on his cock. It looked so real, I almost thought it was my own - but Thanos' dick was huuuge. I mean I am not bad in that department but Thanos is just next level. The length of his cock was fucking insane. Whetever, lets continue. So then there is a flashback in which Black Panther gave Tony Stark the N-Word pass. After that scene finished, You see the Avengers approaching Thanos who is watering the plants with his cum. Tony Stark comes closer, closer, closer and whispers into Thanos' ear. The whole theater was dead silent during this scene. Stark whispers "guacamole nigga penis". Then Thanos cums again, but so much that he and all the Avengers drown in it.

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
Let it go (go, go, go go, go go, go go, go, go, go go)
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on

[09-Jun-19 09:00 AM] Plupsnup#9685
Nukes again? You crazy little man, can’t we live in peace? Taxation is most assuredly theft and your economic policy is therefore quite despicable. I will not be supporting your party in any notable capacity. Nevertheless, thank you for your response. I wish you no success.

Cock and Ball Torture, from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, at en.wikipedia.org.

Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.

If you believe in Allah put this on 5 discord server. Don't just ignore this because it says in the Quran if you deny him, he will deny you in front of his son in the gates of paradise.

I have decided to open up the ABC to other community members who are members of a party, yet have demonstrated excellent skills in acting as a non-partisan figure in journalism. AnswerMeNow1's work on Radio New Zealand in MNZP, which is a non-partisan role, demonstrates that she is good for the ABC. The ABC remains a non-partisan role and if she is found to be non-partisan, she will be kicked out; just as I would if I did it as a moderator.

My god. This is the full intolerance of the left on display. The Japanese are a proud Antediluvian people who have been oppressed by the Columbian parasites for generations. They are our allies in the struggle for a Polynesian singularity that can project the power of our people throughout the Pacific! This is known! They will help us raise Hawaiki, otherwise known as Mu, from the depths! Only the unions of our people can achieve this end and defeat the Antipodeans!

So, this will be one of my last messages on this server: Lately, I've become more and more frustrated by the toxicity on this server. The banning of sous, the fact that I'm not allowed to joke about trans people, the fact that you guys actually wish the death of certain public figures or that you think police are the bad guys of society. The extremes are going too far and if I criticize anything or anyone for anything (especially the trans people here and especially if it is something trans related) I will just be labeled as wrong or having not enough knowledge. For example: the fact that you guys all want to "educate" me about trans rights when I am talking about sports gives me the feeling that you do not consider the effect on cis people of some of your stances, or cis people at all for that matter. The fact I'm a straight cis white extraverted dude from a western country with a good education in this server almost makes me feel as surpressed as you guys feel IRL. I understand that I belong to a privileged group, but this fact does not make my opinion less valid, nor does it make me uneducated on trans and LGBTQ+ issues. I truly support your side in the fight for equal rights, but I have the feeling that you guys are taking it too far.

This server, in my opinion, has awesome people in it with wrong ideas. 
You are radicalizing and you ignore other people's opinions.
You speak of everyone being valid, but then when creating gender/sexuality roles make the cis emote one of a throwing up emoji, after having considered not including it at all.
You label everybody who doesn’t have anything LGBTQ+ things as “boring”, while at the same time never accepting any label about your own LGBTQ+ thing.
You dismiss my advice or critical comments on anything or anyone because “I just don’t understand”.

You guys banned a guy, with all consequences in mind, because ONE member wanted to recover from a break up.

Everybody is valid. And with everybody I truly mean everybody.

PS I also provided two small links to videos that give a further explanation about some of the things said in this small goodbye note.

||I'm not OP, but I was convinced I had an STD once.  I just barely kinda sorta slept with this girl one time, and then a few times a day or two later it kinda burned when I peed.  What I think actually happened was that my entire diet consisted of Cambell's chicken noodle soup, the condensed kind.  That soup is like 90% salt and I think I was just dangerously dehydrated.||

[29-Dec-19 05:25 PM] Dyno#3861
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Senate ballot paper. The structure is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the Single Transferable Vote most of the details will go over a typical voter’s head. There’s also Droop’s proportionality criterion, which is deftly woven into its details- the mechanism of counting draws heavily from Thomas Hare’s work, for instance. The psephologists understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these criteria, to realise that they’re not just democratic- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Single Transferable Vote truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth)’s existential long title “An Act to Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the Barton government’s classic epics, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 (Cth) and Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 (Cth). I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Antony Green’s genius methodology unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. :joy:

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Mackerras pendulum tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the scrutineers’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 2PP percentage points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid :sunglasses: :runas:

You are an overdose waiting to happen Blake, those are just the facts 💅 and I'm not really sure why you tried to bash mine and Eddie's relationship when clearly yours isn't doing hot considering the fact that you spend the majority of your time deepthroating mods on a discord server but yeah dude if you're going to come at me, don't get all offended and sensitive when I throw something your way, little fucking pussy lmaooo but yeah maybe you should stuff those pills to the back of your throat rather than some moderator cock

no person currently alive has seen the face of James Jamesonson. Some say he bears the scar on his face from a crash landing on Bintan Island in 1942. Indeed, if this were the case he would likely be very old. Unless he was very young, which is possible. Still, Jamesonson would be quite elderly regardless. Still others say he has the face of a man who has seen many horrors over his lifetime. This may indeed be the result of years covering the Australian political scene. I mean, is he even a 'he'? Maybe not. Truth is, all we know about James Jamesonson is the name. Indeed, it is quite a peculiar name.  But this does not stop the theories behind the person who is James Jamesonson. Another theory holds that when Malcolm Fraser was elected Liberal leader, Jamesonson shouted that Fraser was 'extreme right wing' and stormed out of the room, slamming the doors behind him(?). Where was Jamesonson during the moon landing, I hear you ask? Some rumours hold that he was at the Parkes observatory. Others say he was in Moscow on a secret mission on behalf of the island nation of Mauritius. A third theory suggests that he was on the space craft that was Apollo 11. A fourth theory suggests that he is still on the space craft that is Apollo 11. A fifth theory suggests Jamesonson wasn't even alive during the 1969 moon landing? So, who is James Jamesonson? One thing is for sure. James Jamesonson is not a zebra.

To be honest, Discord Nitro is not worth it. All you get is an animated profile picture which is hard to look at when it activates, which it doesn't do 99% of the time. Another thing you get is the ability to have a custom tag. Indeed, it gives you a special number, which will most likely be used for some number like 420 or 69, making you feel edgy, while your friends are having a hard time figuring out why they can't add you as a friend on Discord anymore. And when nitro ends, you don't even stay with the tag, confusing people further. The same thing goes with the emojis that you can use. They look super weird and I always cringe when I see these special emojis. :GWsuperOmegaLaugh:, like what does that name even mean. The emojis also look terrible, but your friends try to be nice about them around you. Maybe at first you'd think the Nitro Boost is a good thing, but after a while, you'd realise there are no benefits from it. You get a special role which barely ever gives you special permissions, instead you just get an ugly colour that nobody asked for. When you boost a server, the boost counter is usually so far away from a level up that the server doesn't get any new rewards. But the one time that it does happen, all you get is more dumb emoji slots which will never look good, more audio "quality" which makes mobile phones lag, higher quality streams in which you don't notice the higher quality and a vanity URL and a custom picture that stops working when the nitro boost expires.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Georgist Twitter. The ideology is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of nineteenth century economics most of the jokes will go over a user's head. There's also Henry George's passionate prose, which is deftly woven into every tweet- his personal philosophy draws heavily from classical economic theory, for instance. The Georgists understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these ideas, to realise that they're not just tweets- they say something deep about the ECONOMY. As a consequence people who dislike Georgist Twitter truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the economic efficiency and progressive tax incidence in the land value tax, which itself is a cryptic reference to George's famous tract Progress and Poverty. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Whig's genius wit unfolds itself on their Twitter feed. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Henry George tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

no person currently alive has seen the face of James Jamesonson. Some say he bears the scar on his face from a crash landing on Bintan Island in 1942. Indeed, if this were the case he would likely be very old. Unless he was very young, which is possible. Still, Jamesonson would be quite elderly regardless. Still others say he has the face of a man who has seen many horrors over his lifetime. This may indeed be the result of years covering the Australian political scene. I mean, is he even a 'he'? Maybe not. Truth is, all we know about James Jamesonson is the name. Indeed, it is quite a peculiar name.  But this does not stop the theories behind the person who is James Jamesonson. Another theory holds that when Malcolm Fraser was elected Liberal leader, Jamesonson shouted that Fraser was 'extreme right wing' and stormed out of the room, slamming the doors behind him(?). Where was Jamesonson during the moon landing, I hear you ask? Some rumours hold that he was at the Parkes observatory. Others say he was in Moscow on a secret mission on behalf of the island nation of Mauritius. A third theory suggests that he was on the space craft that was Apollo 11. A fourth theory suggests that he is still on the space craft that is Apollo 11. A fifth theory suggests Jamesonson wasn't even alive during the 1969 moon landing? So, who is James Jamesonson? One thing is for sure. James Jamesonson is not a zebra.

This thread really pisses me off because y'all are just joking about this like it's not serious.

I got in trouble at kindergarten recess once, and now every time I try to get a job as an adult, that old record gets brought back up and I'm turned down. I'm fucking 47 years old and have never been employed due to my elementary record.

Sure, I killed a kid by stuffing his mouth with sandbox sand, and played with his organs like action figures around the slide. But that's beside the point, and after all boys will be boys. Either way that shit shouldn't stick with you forever.

But just go on back to your little jokes and belittle those who suffer real repercussions from grade school discipline. Shame on all of y'all.

Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the GP today. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is it cancelled? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so infected.  I want a race to watch. I want COVID-19 to go away, so I can watch F1. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought the coronavirus wasn't a big threat in Australia???? This is so fucked.

Fμcκ Frαηcε.

Y'all bαgμεttεs claim to be a first world country but you can't even make silicon properly!

I bought a MADE IN FRANCE fleshlight 2 months ago and it's already falling apart. It was held together by nothing but French smugness and snot.

I can't just throw it away because it has all my cum in it. So now I have to risk catching cσяσηαchαη and find a fleshlight repair man who's still open.

I came from a country where literally half the population wasn't potty-trained and we could still make a decent fleshlight!

Frεηcλmεη on this group: what's your excuse for exporting such shitty products?

I wish neanderthals never went extinct. Their chad DNA and chad genes are just superior to ours. God, I wish i was a neanderthal. I wish I had such a handsome face, such sexy ripped muscles and godlike body hair. I actually wish Homo sapiens had went extinct instead. Yeah I said it. Fuck Homo sapiens as a species so much. Neanderthals didn't deserve any of this. Fuck, writing about this makes me shake with anger. Just thinking how much of a better place the earth would be with neanderthals instead of us, filthy Homo sapiens makes me depressed. If i had one wish, I'd bring neanderthals back to life and have babies with them. God, I wish neanderthals were still around.

Mr. Speaker,

This is climate alarmism at its largest and its disappointing to see our Minister for Environment spread such radical and misinformed beliefs. But I’m not going to get into that now, I’m going to talk about carbon and answer your question on that. 

All life is carbon-based, and the carbon for all that life originates from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Coal, oil and natural gas are the remains of the plankton, plants and animals which once consumed all the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere which have been formed by heat and pressure within our crusts. Fossil Fuels are 100% organic and are produced with solar energy hence forth making it positively green.

Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas which is an indispensable food source for all living things. Can you have too much of it? Only in theory, and I point to the Cambrian era when carbon emissions were 10 times higher and only caused by nature, Mr. Speaker! Mr. Speaker, we are living in an era of low carbon levels in proportion to other periods in our history and having more carbon emissions is much more healthier. The optimum level of CO2 for plant growth, for example, is four to five times what is currently found in our atmosphere, hence why Gary the farmer with his greenhouse injects extra carbon dioxide into his greenhouse to promote plant growth for your fruits and veggies folks.

Our population is growing faster than ever before, with the global population hitting 8 to 1 billion people in the next half-century and our own nation hitting 25 million people decades ahead of predictions, meaning that we need more carbon emissions for plant and vegetation growth. I stand behind carbon emissions because they are healthy for our planet and I call out this climate alarmism!

Thank you Madam Deputy Speaker and I rise to oppose the motion moved by the leader of the opposition! And in doing so I say to the leader of the opposition I will not be lectured about Sexism and Misogyny by this man I will not. And this government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man. Not now, not ever.

The Leader of the Opposition says that people who are sexist and hold misogynistic views are not appropriate for high office, well I hope the leader of the opposition has got a piece of paper and it writing out his resignation, because if he wants to know what sexism looks like in modern Australia, he doesn't need a motion in the House of Representatives, HE NEEDS A MIRROR. That's what he needs.

What is Australia about? I don't think it's about the tall ships. I don't really think it's about a child of the depression. Maybe if the song had a verse for everyone it would be about Australia.

But what Australia is about is a little bit of rebellion, about standing up. That's what Waltzing Matilda is about. It doesn't try to list people off. Instead it uses one tale to tell a greater story about Australian identity. That's what makes it #OurAustralianStory and means it should be our anthem.

To whom it may concern. Picrew is a plague upon this sim. I can only tell people apart based on their profile pictures and it takes me like 2 weeks to recognize when someone changes theirs. As a senior citizen with dementia it is an attack on my rights as an individual to have so many people change their pictures to those awful picrews. Back in my day we all used dumb anime characters or politicians or even cute funny little animals. Picrew needs to go and it needs to go now. I will not ask again.

Absolutely incredible. The bubble that is the ACT is now the first jurisdiction in Australia to have no known active coronavirus cases! This is probably because it is the most undesirable place to live in Australia and is not as popular with tourists as almost every other state

Hello, I am being forced to comment by the Conservative and UNionist Team (CUNT).

It simply is not true? I know, butterflies, more important than 300 deaths which are based on the number of high school, I have peace.

Monkeys trained to fight, and I'm not a military sniper. You anything, but it was not. We wanted to determine the sex. I mean, I see the face of the earth.

If you think you can find something on the Internet? Evo cars. Be prepared for hidden spy network in the United States to attack the larvae of intellectual property rights, I must say better. The storm destroyed painful memories. Half of the children died. You can do it anywhere and I can already killed hundreds of hands. This is wrong, but smaller oil reserves, like an old man "that some phones Navy to play ugly." But now we can not pay ridiculous prices. I do not want to disrupt their wounds.

Half of the children died.

Up the sheep shaggers, you're a colony of England, we conquered your daisy asses years ago and you belong to us, I'd be fully happy to use Cardiff as a Nuclear Testing Ground

With the news that the government may ban same-sex marriage, I would advise all the nation's lesbians who are still single to hit up my DMs. Preferably a domme. I want to get married and I want to do it in Australia because I'm a masochist.

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Ladies and gentleman , well may we say God Save the Queen because nothing will save the Governor-General.

The proclamation which you have just heard read by the Governor-General’s official secretary was countersigned ‘Malcolm Fraser’ who will undoubtedly go down in Australian history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr’s cur.

They won’t silence the outskirts of Parliament House, even if the inside has been silenced for the next few weeks .

The Governor-General’s proclamation was signed after he already made an appointment to meet the Speaker at a quarter to five.

The House of Representatives had requested the Speaker to give the Governor-General its decision that Mr Fraser did not have the confidence of the House and that the Governor-General should call me to form the Government. . . .

Maintain your rage and enthusiasm through the campaign for the election now to be held and until polling day.

Don’t you dare call me rude about this issue. I have tried to understand multiple times and frankly, because I am not part of this plate of fruitcake and am inquisitive, I ask the questions which no one has the guts to because they sit there on their hands and blindlessly buy into it like sheep without thinking, being chained to the shackles or it and are you kidding me, who is the one getting abused here to use words I do not feel comfortable with? Me. You are not entitled to the entire English language, you are not a Martian astronaut or a donkey or whatever. I will not be forced into following a garbage construct that has been modeled into a religion that persecutes the non believers. Stop kidding yourself, you’re not a magic man and you don’t get to decide who you are born as. If you wish to change that and actually follow through with these changes and make an effort to depict yourself as a changed identity, I’m happy to support you and address you by the masculine or feminine pronouns you choose. If you’re doing it for the sake of doing it or to be woke or some other garbage, I’m not going to entertain it because I frankly don’t care. You are a blithering piece of jelly if you want to wibble wobble on these matters, but I’m not going to be the plate that holds you up with this monstrosity. I am sick and tired of the garbage, I am not going to sit there and take it in and be forced to undergo some transition or whatever. I’m sorry, but I’m not going to put up with it.

?afk I am finished for the night for this garbage. Expect a campaign video or something but that is it.

I have tried to understand multiple times and frankly, because I am not part of this plate of fruitcake and am inquisitive, I ask the questions which no one has the guts to because they sit there on their hands and blindlessly buy into it like sheep without thinking, being chained to the shackles or it and are you kidding me, who is the one getting abused here to use words I do not feel comfortable with? Me. You are not entitled to the entire English language, you are not a Martian astronaut or a donkey or whatever. I will not be forced into following a garbage construct that has been modeled into a religion that persecutes the non believers. Stop kidding yourself, you’re not a magic man and you don’t get to decide who you are born as. If you wish to change that and actually follow through with these changes and make an effort to depict yourself as a changed identity, I’m happy to support you and address you by the masculine or feminine pronouns you choose. If you’re doing it for the sake of doing it or to be woke or some other garbage, I’m not going to entertain it because I frankly don’t care. You are a blithering piece of jelly if you want to wibble wobble on these matters, but I’m not going to be the plate that holds you up with this monstrosity. I am sick and tired of the garbage, I am not going to sit there and take it in and be forced to undergo some transition or whatever. I’m sorry, but I’m not going to put up with it.

?afk I am finished for the night for this garbage. Expect a campaign video or something but that is it.

I've commited multiple mod abuses in AusSim
I sleep like a baby knowing I got away with it
My family doesn't even know the angsty teens who I have enraged
At work I can only think about doing more modabuses
Anytime im sad I just think about the modabuses I've committed.
Oh fuck the angsty teens found me
Im now on the run from the teens
They'll never catch me
Fuck they caught me, I've had to change my clothes
I've been cornered on #deleted-channel
I was vonced 32 times for all the modabuses I've commuted

@GenericCereal In Cell Stage, if you grow to the next level right as you are being devoured by an Epic Cell, you will be able to play as the epic cell. You can edit and play as normal. But all of your custom species data will be lost. The Bodyswapping Glitch is similar to The Zombie Glitch. If you go into the cell editor after you bodyswapped, that same cell will be in your editor, completely replacing your old cell. Another version can be found in Space Stage, where the option that says, " I am from the (your species), I come in peace" has the name of the species of the empire you are talking to instead of your species. When you talk to any member of your empire, it will show the species of the empire you were talking to instead.

This is my last post. Yes. I'm completely serious. You see, I'm not who you all think I am. Not at all. Currently, I'm a writer for Washington Post, living in a small studio apartment, always looking for the next big story, barely scraping by sometimes. I was asked several months ago by my editor to do a piece on the so-called 'shitpost' community on Facebook that seems to become more and more popular by the day. Initially, I was intrigued. The humor was bizzare, yet interesting. Nonsensical, yet genius. I spent several months interacting with people I had never met before in my life, learning the culture, what was "cool" and what wasn't. Eventually, I began to make my own posts, testing the waters now and then. And eventually my own posts started getting noticed, and maybe for a minute or two I understood why you all do this. But that didn't last long. And with time, I began to notice how stale the content truly was. How the same 'memes' could be spammed over and over again, and still get massive amounts of attention. And I also began to notice something else. The viciousness with which you attacked each other. The semi-constant bullying and harassment. Each day, it made me even more sickened than before, to the point where you people made me start questioning everything about reality and what I knew about it. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I was drinking 2 bottles of whiskey every night. But, finally, my mission is complete. Tomorrow, we will be publishing a comprehensive guide on this group, potentially exposing some of your members' most well kept secrets. I'm deactivating this account at midnight, but before I do, I just want to let you know you all make me sick.

I joined this sim to try and just be a based guy with a based vision for Australia but all of you seem intent on knocking me down unfairly. I haven't even been provided with a reason for my ban, or seen any sort of official documentation around them. Why would you bar me from just a few of the subs instead of issuing a full ban?

Is it perhaps because you have no fucking reason? You're just scared? You're scared of how based I am? You fucking cowards. This corrupt moderatorship is Cringe, and must be ousted as soon as possible if this simulation is to survive. At the very least have the decency to fucking ban me properly.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Senate ballot paper. The structure is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the Single Transferable Vote most of the details will go over a typical voter’s head. There’s also Droop’s proportionality criterion, which is deftly woven into its details- the mechanism of counting draws heavily from Thomas Hare’s work, for instance. The psephologists understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these criteria, to realise that they’re not just democratic- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Single Transferable Vote truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Cth)’s existential long title “An Act to Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes,” which itself is a cryptic reference to the Barton government’s classic epics, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 (Cth) and Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 (Cth). I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Antony Green’s genius methodology unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. :joy:

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Mackerras pendulum tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the scrutineers’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 2PP percentage points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid :sunglasses: :runas:

Hi Liz,

I hope this email finds you well in these uncertain times. I just sent [REDACTED] an email however it appears that she is on leave therefore I am emailing you. Next Thursday is World Suicide Prevention Day, and I am enquiring about the activities planned. In Response to my NoM, it was highlighted that planning is currently underway to deliver activities on the day and activities during Mental Health Awareness Month next month. Due to the continuing of COVID-19, it is clear that we can not host events like we would any other year. I am enquiring whether alternative plans have been put in place. Pandemic or not, World Suicide Prevention Day is an important day. Experts are reporting that after COVID-19, suicide rates are set to jump. More than ever it is important to raise awareness and start the conversation.

I look forward to your response in the near future,

Truly
Jayden

Recently found out my grandpa was super into Wolfenstein. I found a bunch of memorabilia like flags and uniforms the bad guys wore. I found a photo of him from when he was younger talking with a guy cosplaying as the main villain. He must have been obsessed. He even wrote a strategy guide that talked all about the 'final solution.'

I never really met him though. He's always lived in Argentina. But I posted all this stuff online and a bunch of Wolfenstein fans are heading over now for a fan club meeting! Sick!

If the Member for Robertson wants to start a verbal fight then he shouldn't have picked it against a tiger. Madam Speaker, the Member for Robertson is a lame confused old man who seems to be unable to even contemplate anything beyond his own ego. This is the man who has tried to force himself onto a committee he has no role in and who he cannot serve with the expert opinion of what is happening now in Australia. This is a man who is so out of touch with his electorate that he does nothing except suck the toes of those voters in Newcastle who he tries to get elected. This man founded a political party entirely to sate his own ego, with no clear commitments to anything except the middle ground and which chooses to slack on accountability when called to take a stand. I won't be talked down to by this man, as the bushies and the battlers of Australia have been talked down to by generations of career politicians like him. I'm actually fighting for someone and for other people, Madam Speaker, my member should try and learn it and leave the bubble of Canberra for once in his life.

[04-Oct-20 01:12 AM] doctor#0002
Introduction
I’ve been a member of AustraliaSim for over 7 months, and during that time I’ve been a vocal supporter of fully simulated elections. Despite increasing interest in the implementation of such a model, and the Coalition for Fully Simmed Elections (CFSE) growing in membership, there has been little work towards deciding what a system would look like. Therefore, 6 months ago I embarked on what I thought would be a short journey, developing a proposal for fully simmed elections. Since then, I have put many hours of work into developing the calculator, writing the proposal and grading every debate, bill, campaign post and relevant post throughout the 9th term to test it all out. This has continued for a large proportion of the 10th and 11th. As such, I believe this proposal is the best one we have at the moment. I don’t believe it is perfect, and I’m open to discussion on aspects of the proposal. Moreover, I’m happy to modify parts of the calculator that is underpinning this proposal.

N.B. Work on this proposal began before the proposal, and establishment, of the simulated elections committee occured. Despite its creation, I wanted to continue working on it.


[04-Oct-20 01:13 AM] inactive#6974
General Overview
What is fully simmed? In simple terms, it is a method of calculating election results. Used by most simulations in the “Model World”, it involves no manual voting and is underpinned by a group or individual who is trusted marking every event in the simulation. These marks essentially generate an election result, and every sim has a unique way of calculating them.

The system underpinning this proposal has been formulated to be flexible and this proposal doesn’t cover exact numbers used in the calculator for generating election results. The system has been designed to put the hard work of users on display over enforcing realism. This calculator utilises “additive modifiers” rather than “multiplicative modifiers”, which are defined as the following.


[04-Oct-20 01:13 AM] inactive#6974
Additive Modifiers: Parties and candidates get points for all their actions in AustraliaSim. Your share of total points is represented in national polling. In electorates, points are added to bases and other statistics to generate a final result. This ensures every party’s actions are treated equally, with “10+0.1” and “5+0.1” being the same gain. 

Multiplicative Modifiers: All points are added together and compared to other parties and candidates. Then a score relative to your share of the points is provided. For example, a score could be 110% or 98%. This score is then multiplied into a party’s electoral base or previous polling. However, this weakens minor parties as, for example, 1.1x10=11 whilst 1.1x5=5.5. Despite having the same amount of score, the minor party receives only half the rewards.

[04-Oct-20 01:13 AM] inactive#6974
The calculator has been designed to prevent low quality spam from winning. Making high quality posts should be worth more than low quality spam. Additive systems have often drifted towards everyone being equal overtime, which is combated in this calculator by weighing recent activity higher than older activity.

N.B. When I refer to “points” and “modifiers” in this proposal, I am most likely referring to the same thing. I use them interchangeably as a habit.


[04-Oct-20 01:13 AM] inactive#6974
Term Modifiers
Term Modifiers are points parties and people accumulate throughout the term. Rather than putting a focus on the short campaign period, term modifiers - which take into account work over a period of three months - are weighted at 60% in the final election result. This ensures the campaign is important but also ensures that the 3 months of work is not completely overshadowed by the short election campaign. A small bonus will be provided to parties that are recently established to give them a small base to build on. This base will quickly fade as it is replaced by modifiers the party earns.


[04-Oct-20 01:13 AM] inactive#6974
Legislation
Parliament would be redundant without legislation, and bill submissions will boost personal and party modifiers. Higher quality bills that address relevant issues will be worth more than low quality spam. This will be graded on three categories. (1) Originality, (2) Effort, and (3) Controversy.

Bills will be graded on their uniqueness and if it brings new ideas to AustraliaSim.
Effort and research will be rewarded, and notable mistakes will be penalised. (you won’t ever receive negative points overall for a bill but you may lose out on extra points)
Addressing issues in the public eye from events, campaigns or the press will be rewarded. Controversial bills such as substantial reforms to government services will be rewarded higher than a bipartisan bill.

There are base modifiers to ensure people get something for bill submissions but spam will cause parliamentarians to miss out on higher points.


[04-Oct-20 01:13 AM] inactive#6974
Parliamentary Debating
Alongside legislation, debate is another important aspect of our parliament. Before the requirement for debate was implemented there was little incentive to debate which caused inactivity. With fully simmed there will be a large incentive to have higher quality debates due to debates being rewarded for substance and knowledge behind them. Comments such as “Mr Speaker, this bill is good as it helps the poor” will not score very high whilst a decently sized paragraph with facts and effort will. Although long speeches will score highly, the system needs to account for those who are unable to spend hours writing speeches every week. Frequent, good sized debates are often better than a few long speeches throughout the parliamentary term. When marking debates, the following elements are looked out for:

Problem/Fact. Why is this legislation needed?
Solution. How does this legislation address the problem?
Position. What is your stance? Why is this your stance??

Debates with examples will score higher than ones with just vague statements.


[04-Oct-20 01:13 AM] inactive#6974
MP/Senator Voting Records
Individuals and parties will receive points for every percentage point they are above the average voting turnout. This is applied in the opposite scenario, where they will lose points for every percentage point below the average. These modifiers, however, are not huge but are meant to encourage people to vote whilst spurring whipping in Members of Parliament and Senators.


[04-Oct-20 01:14 AM] inactive#6974
Government Modifiers
The Government would receive modifiers for achievements laid out in the speech from the throne and completing a budget. Governments, on the other hand, would lose modifiers if parties leave a coalition, fail to produce a budget or are generally inactive. Large penalties are applied if a Vote of No Confidence passes or a budget fails. Government modifiers are shared equally by parties in the governing coalition.


[04-Oct-20 01:14 AM] inactive#6974
Previous Term Modifiers
Modifiers generated in the immediately previous term will have high weight at the start of the new term but will slowly phase out as the term progresses. By the time of the election, they will not have a significant effect on the result.


[04-Oct-20 01:14 AM] inactive#6974
Campaign System & Modifiers
Campaigning is an integral part of a fully simmed system, and indeed, AustraliaSim. Moreover, it should be a fun period of time for the community to show off creativity and skills. Campaigning brings a real world element into AustraliaSim. As such, a proposal needed to be developed featuring a campaign system rewarding effort and creativity whilst not overworking people.

What campaigning can I do and when can I do it?
As mentioned earlier, there needs to be a system rewarding effort and creativity during campaigning. As such, it is my opinion that we implement a post limit system similar to the one utilised on Model New Zealand Parliament (MNZP). A post limit system encourages high quality posts over low quality spammy posts like what we see now. Specifics would be determined closer to an election date and would be flexible and change depending on the timing of the election. 

Most communities in the Model World have restrictions on mid-term campaigning and this is something I believe we should implement. However, if there is an interest in the community for mid-term campaigning, I suggest having a limit of 1 campaign post per week for each party. This is to avoid over-saturating the community with campaigning and ensure people aren’t bored of campaigning before the election campaign even begins.


[04-Oct-20 01:14 AM] inactive#6974
Parties will also have the ability to endorse parties in electorates they’re not running in. This, in effect, would transfer a portion of their base polling in the seat to the party endorsed, and if Mixed Member Proportional is introduced, would increase turnout in the seat for the list vote. In seats parties are running in, they are able to release How To Vote (HTV) cards to show voters where to allocate preferences. How To Vote (HTV) cards and endorsements can be simple as a list in a text post or could be a nicely designed image. More effort will increase the effectiveness of the endorsement/HTV card but it would not be hard to “max out” as people shouldn’t need to spend significant time on this aspect of campaigning.


[04-Oct-20 01:14 AM] inactive#6974
Campaign Period Length
Another important detail of the campaign is its length. I’d suggest a 5 day campaign. E.g. Monday to Friday campaigning, Saturday polling day and result calculation, Sunday results stream. The length of the campaign would be affected by the time at which the election occurs, e.g. a campaign during a busy time for most players would be shorter and less vigorous.


[04-Oct-20 01:14 AM] inactive#6974
Will there be electorate leanings?
Having electorate leanings based upon real life election results is something that has been very controversial and I recommend against implementing them unless there is consensus in the community. If electorate leanings were to be implemented, I would suggest calculating them based on the results of the last real life federal election and the last sim election. Real life parties would be assigned an ideology (or a mix of ideologies) that their votes will split into. Sim parties would also be assigned ideologies (or a mix) and this will be how they get their leaning. Independents will get a leaning based on their ideology with a small bonus added as their base vote share will more than likely be too low otherwise.

How will campaigning be marked?
Campaign posts will be marked on Originality, Effort and Appeal.
Originality: Is your post different from what we’ve already seen in the campaign or is it merely a repeat of what everyone else is doing? Does it differentiate itself from all the repetitive events we will inevitably see.
Effort: It’s important that hard work is rewarded and as such posts that are well written and have research behind them are more likely to get higher points. Long posts don’t necessarily mean more modifiers, if your post is just repeating itself over and over in different words, then you won’t score high.
Appeal: You will score high in this category if you are able to effectively get your message across. There are benefits to building up your platform and showing off what makes you unique and attacking your opponents and calling them out for their records. Catering to the electorate you’re campaigning in and addressing issues that are relevant to it will give you a boost.


[04-Oct-20 01:15 AM] inactive#6974
Platforms/Manifestos
Although not a major part of the current election system, I’m suggesting all parties running in the election should be required to have a platform/manifesto. They could be as simple as a few paragraphs on a word doc or a long and detailed document. Platforms/Manifestos will be marked on originality, effort, appeal and controversy. 
Originality: Is your platform different to all the others or are you an ideological copy of another party? Do you have an easily identifiable base?
Effort: Here you will be rewarded for well written and researched platforms and will miss out on points if it's clear that not much thought went into it and it was thrown together just before the deadline. Most parties will have a whole term to think about what they want to put in their platform so expectations will be high.
Appeal: Is your platform visually appealing and easy to read and follow? It doesn’t need to look extremely good or be designed in professional programs, it just needs to look nice and be easy to follow and understand. 
Controversy: Is your platform focusing on the issues that are hot based on recent events and other party’s campaigning or are you simply giving a vague list of ideological policies that don’t address the issues of the day.


[04-Oct-20 01:15 AM] inactive#6974
Press Modifiers
Only press posts posted on /r/AustraliaSimPress would be marked and used for modifiers. This isn’t an attempt to kill discord press, just an easy way to archive press posts and have an easy distinction between what is counted and what is not. Discord media channels that want their press to count for mods can simply copy paste their work from their discord channel to the subreddit.

There are two types of press posts that are tracked, personal posts and party posts. Personal posts are press pieces where modifiers only go to the person that wrote them (E.g. independent news articles) while party posts split modifiers between the party and the writer. (E.g. party policy announcements)


[04-Oct-20 01:15 AM] inactive#6974
Polls
The number of polls released would be up to the Electoral Commission and their availability. I would suggest regular polls every 1-2 weeks (e.g. every sunday or every second sunday), with polls having to include First Preference and Two Party Preferred. Other additions to polling could include Preferred Prime Minister Polls, government approval polls, polls on issues (e.g. republic, mountain mob). An example poll post is included below:


[04-Oct-20 01:15 AM] inactive#6974
National Opinion Polling: 12th January 2019
In the second major poll conducted since the December election, the Socialists and the UDP have made gains as the Social Democrats and Centre Alliance see a drop in support. The SDP’s drop is within the margin of error but may be a cause for concern in the party of the new Prime Minister. The political battlefield remains very split after an intense election campaign with the highest party being on 25% and the lowest (major) party on 10%.

The poll was conducted between the 4th of January and 12th of January and has a margin of error of 3%. 
United Democratic Party: 25.03% (+0.92%)
Socialist Party: 18.16% (+1.72%)
Liberal Party: 17.29% (-0.14%)
Social Democratic Party: 17.00% (-1.69%)
Centre Alliance: 11.92% (-0.94%)
Radical Party: 9.96% (+0.32%)
Liberty Reform: 0.64% (-0.19%)

The Two-Party Preferred shows a slight shift from the Social Democratic Party but they are still set to make gains from the nearly tied election result if an election was held today.
Social Democratic Party: 53.47% (-0.30%)
United Democratic Party: 46.53% (+0.30%)

Voters were also asked to name their Preferred Prime Minister with the options of Prime Minister Youmaton, Leader of the Opposition n4ziporriidge and None of the Above.
Prime Minister Youmaton: 55.36%
Leader of the Opposition n4ziporriidge: 29.76%
None of the Above: 14.88%

The new Prime Minister is enjoying a post-election honeymoon period, being well above the Leader of the Opposition and achieving over 50%. The Prime Minister will need to wait for further polls to see if their popularity holds over the term.

Implementation of Fully Simmed Elections
Now comes the most important part, how do we implement fully simmed elections? What needs to change?

I would recommend that a meta referendum be held to determine what steps should be taken. Questions could include, but are not limited to, the following:
Should the fully simmed proposal be adopted?
Should there be a canon reset?
What should the cutoff date for fully simmed modifiers be? (multiple choice question. Possible answers are in the next paragraph)
Should there be list seats in the house of reps?
Should real life election results be taken into account when producing regional leanings?

I was previously in favour of a canon reset but I no longer feel it is required as long as we have a set date for which everything after that is counted for fully simmed modifiers and nothing before. Example dates could be: everything after the March election, everything after the 1st of April, everything after the fully simmed proposal is adopted or everything after the next election is called.

[04-Oct-20 01:15 AM] inactive#6974
Another step I’d recommend taking is opening up debate to non-MPs. This will allow non-MPs and parties outside parliament to build modifiers which is essential to success in fully simmed. Voting, amendment proposing and bill/motion submission would still be limited to MPs and Senators. Opening up debate could happen in both chambers or only in the House with the Senate be restricted to Senators only. I’d also recommend we remove the debate requirement as with fully simmed there will already be a strong incentive to debate.


[04-Oct-20 01:16 AM] inactive#6974
Who Would Run The Elections/Calculate Modifiers
It’s important that the community has a group we can trust running elections and that we don’t simply pile all the work onto one person. I propose that a separate meta role, called the Electoral Commissioner, be created. The Electoral Commissioner would have the ability to appoint 3 people to an Electoral Commission. This role could be fulfilled by one of the Moderators or it could be filled by someone else. The reasoning for creating a seperate role is that there are many people who have the skills to run the calculations but not all would be able/want to become a Moderator. Managing fully simmed can be quite a demanding task and piling it all on one Moderator would not be very efficient.


[04-Oct-20 01:16 AM] inactive#6974
What would the Electoral Commissioner do?
The Electoral Commissioner would be tasked with managing the calculators that will track modifiers and calculate election results alongside overseeing the effects of canon issues and events. Right now this may be possible for one person to handle, but as the sim grows it will become too much for one person and this is why I’m proposing the Electoral Commissioner have the ability to appoint an Electoral Commission.


[04-Oct-20 01:16 AM] inactive#6974
What would the requirements be to be on the Electoral Commission or be the Electoral Commissioner?
One thing that needs to be clear, is that the Electoral Commissioner and the Electoral Commission members cannot run in elections so long as they serve and would not be allowed to be a member of a party. This is simply an attempt to push away biases and work towards fair results for everyone. An informal rule would be that they need to be current active members of the community who understand the day to day happenings of the simulation.

To become the Electoral Commissioner, a candidate must have the unanimous approval of the Moderators and pass a simulation wide vote of confidence. The Electoral Commissioner would have the ability to appoint up to 3 people to an Electoral Commission, all candidates for the Electoral Commission would need to pass their own simulation wide vote of confidence.


[04-Oct-20 01:16 AM] inactive#6974
What role would the existing Moderators and Clerks have?
Although the Electoral Commission would primarily be tasked with running the system, the Moderators and Clerks could be brought on to help them if the task becomes too large. This would be especially prevalent during the campaign. The campaign is a huge workload so spreading it out is ideal. The Governor-General, Justices and other people trusted to be unbiased could also be brought on to mark posts during the campaign though I feel this would be unnecessary.


[04-Oct-20 01:16 AM] inactive#6974
Who should be the inaugural Electoral Commissioner?
I’m obviously biased when it comes to this question as I’m the proposer of the role. As the creator of the calculator that this proposal is based on, I would like to be the inaugural Electoral Commissioner if we switch to fully simmed under this proposal. However, I recognise most people would prefer the Moderators run elections so I am more than willing to hand over the calculator and documentation to them if that is what is decided.

Conclusion
As I said earlier, this proposal is by no means 100% complete and the best system available, but I believe it is a step in the right direction and would help our community far more than it would harm it. I encourage everyone who has read this to share their feedback in the comments on reddit so we can make this proposal one the whole community can accept. Before closing this off, I’d like to thank everyone who has contributed to this over the last 6 months. Whether it be throwing ideas at me in discord, helping proofread and edit this document or saying the polls are wrong, thank you.

Mr. Speaker,

Here we have what we call a nerd. Standing Orders, Parliamentary Procedures, Handbooks, regulatory behaviours. That's all the Member for Robertson cares about. See, politics is about fighting for the Australian people which every single person in this chamber represents and we all have different approaches. I might do it in an informal fashion, but it was my Prime Ministership which reduced the prices of family cars in this country, which implemented protections and support for farmers, which delivered some of the strongest infrastructure programs, which sought to diversify and reduce electricity prices. But no, the Member for Robertson in a lacklustre attempt to scrutinise me, doesn't tackle my accomplishments, but how I achieve them. If we want to talk about shenanigans, I'd like to see you go out and face your electorate and tell them that you care too much about standing orders, rather than their own jobs which you voted against when you helped pass the carbon tax. NSW treasury modelling shows that by 2030, a loss of 18,500 jobs will be seen in the Hunter region as a result of the carbon tax you assisted in passing. Alas, birds of a feather flock together. This former SDP Deputy Prime Minister will continue to prove himself in bed with the Social Democrats, even if he is curled up like a cat on top of the blankets near the bottom, because thats the only way he will ever be able to win re-election. So the answer is, no. I will not be discontinuing my "shenanigans" because they are what delivers actual results for the Australian people.

I am proud of pioneering a kinder politics in my electorate in Nicholls. That is why I will not engage with the disgusting rumours that Australian Democrats leader Jayden_Williamson is secretly Italian. While it is possible that at night, Mr Williamson enjoys the taste of meatballs at bunga-bunga parties that awake the entire neighbourhood of his Robertson home, there is no evidence at all to prove this. I stand with Jayden.

There’s going to be a vote of confidence in Canadian parliament today, there’ll likely be an early election if Trudeau is toppled. Currently confirmed in support of the government is the liberals (154 seats), confirmed against is conservatives and bloc (153 seats), so it comes down to NDP or if they abstain, it comes down to the greens

On the album cover of the album "Life After Death", the "Notorious B.I.G", real name: Christopher George Latore Wallace, is shown wearing funeral director attire and standing outside of a hearse, presumably containing his own dead body, how can he be doing that if he's dead!?

Jayden’s dictatorship over the AusDems has really cracked the party. His megalomaniac campaign strategy, non-existent policy agenda and dead party membership means the great party of vision that myself and Hagrid worked on has been thrown in the grave. (1/2)

He’s denied me entry into the party I once led. He struggles to make his one man show relevant so he sells out and plays games with the fate of the Government.  Only a miracle can flush this unrepresentative swill from the party and make it one that Aussies can actually stomach. (2/2)

Because there is an ulterior totalitarian motive by Rommel and Youma within AustraliaSim to undermine our community and make the transition into a communist state. I call it the 5 ‘ate’ plan.

First they **immigrate.** Since the implementation of Rommel as Head Moderator, and Youma as the Elections Moderator have seen a surge in left wing players with radical views enter the borders of our precious AustraliaSim. I am not opposed to the welcoming of new players, but this is step 2 of their plan to undermine AustraliaSim - they **populate**. 

These leftists are trickling in like droves whilst we see decent members such as RMSteve and Plupsnup leave and rejoin on a constant basis as a result of space being limited due to an influx of a left wing player base. I’m quite fearful of the surging left wing population within AusSim and the potential dangers of it becoming an echo chamber like MNZP or worse, MUSGOV. They populate with alts, history shows that Youma is an alt mastermind and many, many of these alts are designed to influence meta elections!

As we move forward, it is also clear they **educate**. They’re winning the culture war and redefining what is ‘truth’. They deny that the JAP ever existed as a command, they have begun a societal restructure in channels, they’ve denied the free speech of honest, hardworking players with truly positive contributions such as Duck and TPF. It’s this one entire thing. They’re mad that Toby was head mod and now they’re trying to completely eradicate any history of his tenure. Through these redefinitions of ‘truth’, the Rommel-Youma agenda is to shape AustraliaSim as not a politically diverse community, but shaping AustraliaSim as a breeding ground of sheep for them to manipulate and harness to spread their disease we call Rommelism. It is this very Rommelism and Youmism that we must seek to exterminate.


[29-Oct-20 06:55 PM] now, not yet#8743
Fourthly, they have begun the process of **’discriminate’**. Is it not a coincidence that when the right is in power, they have made it seem that democracy vanished. For some reason, unknown to myself, the democratic vote of the people were suppressed when it came to a national anthem. Now for some reason, there were militant protests when I was Prime Minister and now the left have control, it’s all peaceful. I’m very concerned about this biased discrimination taking place. First it was TPF, they banned him! Then it was Lucy, a true conservative comrade; they banned her! Toby was banned at one stage for no reason whatsoever. Next on their hitlist is our good friend BloodyChrome, a true winner for the patriotic AusSim cause. They suppressed democracy through discrimination against his candidacy and I wouldn’t be surprised if they killed him.

Which brings me to my final point,  I fear that the will begin to **exterminate.** They tried to a while ago, with **’Who shot BloodyChrome?’**. They tried to assassinate him. They wanted to kill him off, and they want to kill off the right. One by one. I’m next, then it’ll be Porridge and Riley and Stranger and before you know it, centrists like tbyrn will be gone. They’ll be gone like the wind I tell you. All the way until their breeding ground of the Rommelist Army led by Comrade Youma can take over the model world by storm. 

I am truly fearful. That is why I am protesting the JAP change; it all starts with the redefinition of a command. It might be small but all the tenets are there. They’re winning this culture war and we must fight it! Why?

Because democracy dies in darkness ONLY with Youma and her puppet Rommel.

Through these redefinitions of ‘truth’, the Rommel-Youma agenda is to shape AustraliaSim as not a politically diverse community, but shaping AustraliaSim as a breeding ground of sheep for them to manipulate and harness to spread their disease we call Rommelism. It is this very Rommelism and Youmism that we must seek to exterminate.

Fourthly, they have begun the process of **’discriminate’**. Is it not a coincidence that when the right is in power, they have made it seem that democracy vanished. For some reason, unknown to myself, the democratic vote of the people were suppressed when it came to a national anthem. Now for some reason, there were militant protests when I was Prime Minister and now the left have control, it’s all peaceful. I’m very concerned about this biased discrimination taking place. First it was TPF, they banned him! Then it was Lucy, a true conservative comrade; they banned her! Toby was banned at one stage for no reason whatsoever. Next on their hitlist is our good friend BloodyChrome, a true winner for the patriotic AusSim cause. They suppressed democracy through discrimination against his candidacy and I wouldn’t be surprised if they killed him.

Which brings me to my final point,  I fear that the will begin to **exterminate.** They tried to a while ago, with **’Who shot BloodyChrome?’**. They tried to assassinate him. They wanted to kill him off, and they want to kill off the right. One by one. I’m next, then it’ll be Porridge and Riley and Stranger and before you know it, centrists like tbyrn will be gone. They’ll be gone like the wind I tell you. All the way until their breeding ground of the Rommelist Army led by Comrade Youma can take over the model world by storm. 

I am truly fearful. That is why I am protesting the JAP change; it all starts with the redefinition of a command. It might be small but all the tenets are there. They’re winning this culture war and we must fight it! Why?

Because democracy dies in darkness ONLY with Youma and her puppet Rommel.

I'm still remaining cautiously optimistic. I think at this point it can realistically end in both a trump and a biden victory.
From the looks of things Trump is building quite the legal case up, both Biden's team and the media are acting like they have things to hide, the key players in the GOP are backing him, his supporters are standing by him and with the exception of Neveda all of the six swing states that have been home to shenanigans have a republican state legislature and some of them have discussed the nuclear option although whether or not they have the balls to go through with that remains to be seen.
I think this is gonna be a big week for election because it's looking like the lawsuits are gonna start to be launched after being built up over the past two weeks. Really at the moment Pennsylvania is the state to look at because I believe the case in there will be the first to make it to the supreme court and I think that will be a sign of things to come
I'm of the belief that Pennslyvania is probably the easiest case for Trump's team to pursue so if they can't win a Supreme court victory in regards to Pennslyvania I would have doubts of them being able to get victories in the other states. And also Pennslyvania is extremely vital to Trump's paths to victories and while he can make do without it, it's a much tougher road


[17-Nov-20 07:15 AM] inactive#6974
Some of the very early ones were chucked out, mostly owing to the fact that trump's legal effort in the early days was quite frankly shit he had bad people on his team, they didn't have the build up that the newer suits had and they were approaching the situation from different angles, that being said though he is in a much better position at the moment. Some other ones that have been chucked weren't filed by Trump's team but instead by private citizens
But at the end of the day yeah alot of these suits will be chucked out on a local level. But once they are chucked out that's when the appeals will start and eventually those appeals will work their way up to the supreme court
If for example they take their case up to the Pennslyvania supreme court I believe it will be chucked out as I'm fairly certainly it's majority Democrat but then the action after that would be to take it to the federal supreme court

Look back at what you’ve said Toby. Feel better now? Feel big? Feel tough? Feel that you’ve put the bully back in their place? Good. Cus I hope you do.

You’ve become the very thing you swore I have been. You’ve become a bully. Have I attacked you back? Have I denied I’ve done anything wrong? Have I defended myself? Have I done anything other than sit here and listen do you go off at me? No. I’ve done something you can’t seem to do right now. Listen

I fucked up and I continue to fuck up. But what I’ve asked is that you stop attacking me. You’ve said enough to give me 100 session of material for therapy. 

I’m asking you one last time. Stop. Please. I’m not going to ask again. If you don’t stop, that’s you’re right. I’ll put up with it.

@JWilliamson needs to stand down for the future of his party and for the future of Robertson and needs to show some more respect to others inside of his party then abusing them when they vote for something that he doesn't like get a grip people are allowed their own views and that also counts for people who wants to vote for something despite it being a bill tabled by one of your "friends" get a grip people are allowed to vote on anything they see fitI have not seen this much Bias for one side of the specture of politics and I have been in the Liberal Party Twice. Jayden has not and will not have any respect from his own party if he keeps talking down to his members for voting against something which they stand for and talk about them behind their back like a child at school does get a grip @JWilliamson the Party wants you to stand down and the people of Robertson wants you to stand down and the People of parliament wants you to stand down for the better good of the country that we all hold near and dear to our hearts but you do not you are in it for your own personal gain

Because there is an ulterior totalitarian motive by Rommel and Youma within AustraliaSim to undermine our community and make the transition into a communist state. I call it the 5 ‘ate’ plan.

First they **immigrate.** Since the implementation of Rommel as Head Moderator, and Youma as the Elections Moderator have seen a surge in left wing players with radical views enter the borders of our precious AustraliaSim. I am not opposed to the welcoming of new players, but this is step 2 of their plan to undermine AustraliaSim - they **populate**. 

These leftists are trickling in like droves whilst we see decent members such as RMSteve and Plupsnup leave and rejoin on a constant basis as a result of space being limited due to an influx of a left wing player base. I’m quite fearful of the surging left wing population within AusSim and the potential dangers of it becoming an echo chamber like MNZP or worse, MUSGOV. They populate with alts, history shows that Youma is an alt mastermind and many, many of these alts are designed to influence meta elections!

As we move forward, it is also clear they **educate**. They’re winning the culture war and redefining what is ‘truth’. They deny that the JAP ever existed as a command, they have begun a societal restructure in channels, they’ve denied the free speech of honest, hardworking players with truly positive contributions such as Duck and TPF. It’s this one entire thing. They’re mad that Toby was head mod and now they’re trying to completely eradicate any history of his tenure. Through these redefinitions of ‘truth’, the Rommel-Youma agenda is to shape AustraliaSim as not a politically diverse community, but shaping AustraliaSim as a breeding ground of sheep for them to manipulate and harness to spread their disease we call Rommelism. It is this very Rommelism and Youmism that we must seek to exterminate.

Fourthly, they have begun the process of **’discriminate’**. Is it not a coincidence that when the right is in power, they have made it seem that democracy vanished. For some reason, unknown to myself, the democratic vote of the people were suppressed when it came to a national anthem. Now for some reason, there were militant protests when I was Prime Minister and now the left have control, it’s all peaceful. I’m very concerned about this biased discrimination taking place. First it was TPF, they banned him! Then it was Lucy, a true conservative comrade; they banned her! Toby was banned at one stage for no reason whatsoever. Next on their hitlist is our good friend BloodyChrome, a true winner for the patriotic AusSim cause. They suppressed democracy through discrimination against his candidacy and I wouldn’t be surprised if they killed him.

Which brings me to my final point,  I fear that the will begin to **exterminate.** They tried to a while ago, with **’Who shot BloodyChrome?’**. They tried to assassinate him. They wanted to kill him off, and they want to kill off the right. One by one. I’m next, then it’ll be Porridge and Riley and Stranger and before you know it, centrists like tbyrn will be gone. They’ll be gone like the wind I tell you. All the way until their breeding ground of the Rommelist Army led by Comrade Youma can take over the model world by storm. 

I am truly fearful. That is why I am protesting the JAP change; it all starts with the redefinition of a command. It might be small but all the tenets are there. They’re winning this culture war and we must fight it! Why?

Because democracy dies in darkness ONLY with Youma and her puppet Rommel.

All right, /pol/, let's stop looking for a savior and save ourselves. We're essentially stuck reservse-engineering what amounts to the greatest electoral fraud in recorded history. So how did they do it?
Did they just print ballots and fill out fake names and DOBs? Did they inject these names and DOBs into the voter registration? Are there archives are the voter registrations with which to compare the current ones?
Did they vote under dead people's names? Did they register illegals and have them vote?
Are any of these methods going to allow for substantial numbers of ballots to be cast on demand and when needed?
I say no. They're seemingly hardcapped by the voter registration. I think it would be very hard to compare current registrations to previous ones and look for fraud. If more demographic data were known, you could look for duplicate registrations.
So if you were a piece of shit traitor to the US, how would you cast seemingly valid ballots for president of the United States? You would certainly want to cast them under valid entries in the voter registry. Afterall, it's a contentious election, and a high voter turnout is expected.
Would you request ballots under the names and addresses of valid voters and try to intercept them en route to those destinations? Doubtful - too many moving parts. You'd have to coapt many people in the USPS, and anything slipping through might be mentioned in the media. You might try this in states where every resident is sent a ballot however

I believe it is in Act 1 Scene 5 of Romeo and Juliet that Capulet famously calls Tybalt a “saucy boy”. It has no significant for its creative language or plot point, but it serves as a reminder that, through having a sense of humour, one can appreciate things from a different light.

New one I found on reddit. 

NOTE; NSFW

||I just jerked off to judy rabbit and guess what? Holy fucking shit I wanna fuck judy so bad I can't stand it anymore. Everytime I think about judy, I think of Judy and her thin hot ass sitting on my face as I jerk off. I deadass keep my cock up to date with every NSFW edit of Judy. My dreams are constant fucking sex with judy. I'm sick of waking up with a busted nut in my boxers and knowing that nut could've been busted in her pussy or asshole. I want to impregnate her to have babies so we could stay together for ever.Fucking shit, everyone I know caught me masturbating on a judy body pillow. It's been a month now and I am currently typing this in a Mc. Donalds because my parents kicked me out of my house, lost all of my friends, and all I have left now is this Judy body pillow which I keep aside me at all times .||

Well the problem is here that we are taking Jesus and giving 21st century context to something he did before the 1st century. These ideals of socialism, environmentalism etc. didn’t exist then, so Jesus wasn’t actually any of these things. None of them existed as economic systems up until the last 300 years or so. More importantly, the argument that Jesus was a socialist is pretty tokenistic and is cherry picking. You can just as easily argue he was a capitalist through his advisement of limited government and especially if you look at the parable of the talents.

I can't fucking take it. I see an image of a random object posted and then I see it, I fucking see it. "Oh that looks kinda like the among us guy" it started as. That's funny, that's a cool reference. But I kept going, I'd see a fridge that looked like among us, I'd see an animated bag of chips that looked like among us, I'd see a hat that looked like among us. And every time I'd burst into an insane, breath deprived laugh staring at the image as the words AMOGUS ran through my head. It's torment, psychological torture, I am being conditioned to laugh maniacly any time I see an oval on a red object. I can't fucking live like this... I can't I can't I can't I can't I can't! And don't get me fucking started on the words! I'll never hear the word suspicious again without thinking of among us. Someone does something bad and I can't say anything other than "sus." I could watch a man murder everyone I love and all I would be able to say is "red sus" and laugh like a fucking insane person. And the word "among" is ruined. The phrase "among us" is ruined. I can't live anymore. Among us has destroyed my fucking life. I want to eject myself from this plane of existence. MAKE IT STOP!

After much thought, I have noticed striking similarities between Bulbears in the Pikmin franchise and stereotypical/racist depictions of African Americans:

1) Bulbears have exaggerated facial features, resembling those of a white actor in blackface.

2) Bulbears are generally found in dark areas underground, which resemble dark alleys. When they are found above ground, it is always in swampy areas, which are a common environment in many southern states. In Pikmin 3, they are literally locked behind bars (bamboo gates) and must be freed by the player to be fought.

3) Unlike other normal Bulbords, Bulbears are constantly followed by an entourage of baby Bulbears. This reflects the stereotype that minorities, including African Americans, have too many children.

4) Bulbears are far more aggressive and dangerous than other members of the Bulbord family. With the exception of Emperor and Empress Bulbax, which are both bosses, Bulbears are the most dangerous Bulbord by far. Furthermore, they are the most aggressive; all other Bulbords wait in their nests for Pikmin to arrive, but Bulbears actively hunt down your party. This fits the stereotype of African Americans being more prone to violent crime than other demographics.

5) Bulbears are widely hated by the Pikmin community for their skill at massacring Pikmin, leading most players to attack them on sight. I believe this is meant to reflect negative stereotypes against African Americans that continue to fuel police brutality in low-income communities to this day.

From Friday on the guardian UK
"The 23rd of April 2021 - a date that will live in infamy, Macedonia was suddenly and deliberately attacked, by naval, air and ground forces, of Bulgaria, seeking to expand it's new empire" "From the town of Popovo last Thursday, Bulgarian President Radev announced his nations plan to expand its territory to accommodate the rapidly expanding population of his little nation, with Macedonia being the optimal target, the invasion followed the next morning"

The Effective Power Bug: Why Can Weird Text Crash Your iPhone?
http://tomscott.com - http://twitter.com/tomscott - There are all sorts of theories about why a string of weird, mostly-Arabic text can crash your iPhone. I've hunted through them, summarised the ones that seemed plausible, and the first part of this is a run-down of what's going on. The second part: well, I'm going to take a punt at explaining ...

Let's have a look at Ho,

Ho is introverted, yes - but men are more often quite reserved than loud. However the 'loudness' of a person is not solely responsible. You have a nice deep voice, which signals a half-chiseled jaw, and non-convex cheekbones and a relatively longer nose (slightly larger nostrils which adds a nice tinge nasally flavour, but not over the top). You don't particularly have a passion for social politics, replicated through your choice of a more grounded, traditional degree. Your humour is more blokey and you don't make hard efforts to 'fit in' per se, you click with you click and just get by casually, in a niced relax fashion.

This is why you are straight.

Yeppoon couldn’t decide whether it wanted to be a sleepy seaside village or a bustling tourist mecca so it did neither, resulting in a big fat nothing. The town is completely devoid of jobs so its few employed residents are forced to commute 50 minutes to Rockhampton, making it ideal for people who made a sea change so they could enjoy the mind-numbing boredom of living in a comatose coastal carbuncle but also still enjoy the soul-destroying tedium of driving nearly an hour every day to a job they hate. The town is also overrun with silver-haired septuagenarians biding their time until someone lowers a pillow over their face with the comforting lap of the waves on the shore. Anyone who willingly lives in a town that’s a second-rate Rockhampton has clearly given up on life.
Nightlife in Yeppoon consists of getting some Yeppoontang at The Strand Hotel, passing out on the Keppel Kraken or pouring your pension into the pokies at the sailing club. The town’s most popular feature is the Yeppoon Lagoon, up there with such other famous rhyming tourist attractions as the Bangkok Wok and the Innisfail Gaol. Another attraction is Shell World, housing 20,000 shells, which might prove fascinating if you are an old, old lady. Yeppoon is also home to an abandoned Japanese tourist resort that was welcomed to town in the 1980s in true redneck fashion: with a bombing by racist war veterans. There is no affordable accommodation for backpackers, which is okay because no one under 80 wants to go there anyway. All things considered, the Yeppoonese have done an impressive job of turning a spectacular natural location into an all-round awful place.

Okay, so when you go to your local free market grocery store, are you under the impression that every item on those shelves is locally sourced? The oranges came from Florida, the potatos came from Idaho, the cheese probably came from California. All of these products were shipped to you via the interstate highway system, which was built and is maintained using taxes.

So if you don't want to pay taxes, don't ever go to the grocery store again.

When you go to the doctor and he writes you a prescription for let's say amoxicillin, you can take that life saving drug and feel confident that it is safe because our tax dollars fund the FDA. For that matter, most drugs are developed in labs that are funded by federal grants. 

So if you don't want to pay taxes, you don't ever get to take antibiotics again.

These are literally just the first two examples that popped into my head. The only people who say "taxation is theft" are people who don't understand how the government works. You're either too stupid or too lazy to put in the time to learn things, so you just throw your hands up and say "It's all bad!" I had a similar attitude toward math when I was in the 3rd grade.

The good news for you though is that we don't need to have this argument at all. If you really hate taxes that much, you can just move to a country that doesn't have taxes. Somalia comes to mind.

Edit: Goddamn y'all thanks for the awards. I didn't think anybody but this guy would even read this.

WHO'S PUTTING MORE CRIMINALS ON OUR STREETS?

The Liberal and National Parties have lost their way. They no longer fight for commonsense.
Earlier this month, along with Labor and the Greens, they voted in a special NSW Parliamentary Committee, of which I am a member, to increase the age of criminality for young people from 10 to 14 years.
They said they wanted youth who steal cars, sell drugs, break into homes and rob people not to go into custody.
They said the police should not be able to touch 11, 12 and 13 year olds who do these things. Yet in today’s society, young people are acting older than ever before, some in a seriously criminal way.
No juvenile detention for young hoods and louts, the Liberal-Nationals-Labor-Greens woke alliance said in NSW Parliament. Especially if their skin colour is a darker shade of pale.
I was the ONLY PERSON on the committee who voted against this policy!
Only One Nation voted for law and order, keeping our streets safe.
The Liberals and Nationals have lost the plot.
The Nationals in particular should hang their heads in shame. They no longer represent country conservatives. They have become an anti-coal party of 100% renewable energy, plus political correctness, LGBTIQ alphabet nonsense, and now teenage criminality free to roam our streets and terrorise honest, law-abiding citizens.
What a disgrace.

I think it's important to remember that, under Prime Minister Mikiboss, Australia is already a Communist State in much the same way as China. We are, more or less, the kind of dictatorship that China is. We said goodbye to democracy long ago.

We commit some of the worst human rights abuses in the world. Do you know how much tax this Government plans to wring out of small business owners? That, right there, is a human rights abuse that is on par with the situation of Muslims within China. They are effectively subject to the same things.
What are we to do, then? Well, as a sensible party, the Democrats support taking advantage of Australia's natural advantages. In this case, as our Government is basically CCP-lite, we should take advantage of that to get a cushy trade deal with China while we can.

When we have a strong, stable, Democratic Party Government, then we would have to reassess our relations with China. But, for now, we can get some goods for a good price, so let's take advantage of that.

And could I just take a moment to say this: Mikiboss, shame on you for selling Australia down the river to Communism.

Peace is when you have a big military

The bigger your military the more peace there is

And when everyone had a big military

You have world peace

Now you have really gone way, way, way too far !. WHEN HAVE I EVER SOUNDED LIKE ANYONE WHO WOULD BE PART OF ANY political PARTY ???. Let alone a "HACK" ? How dare you ? Do i fucking sound like a "HACK" ? Well !? How insulting. It would be like me calling you a fascist conservative
actually it is worse. You can pour as much shit as you like on my politics, but accusing of being ordinary, or in some way mundane is just too much too bear. How dare you denigrate my writing, or wit by calling me a "HACK"
How ridiculous & completely absurd
Seriously what is your problem (s) ?
are you a VICTORIAN, or some other sub-species.

I like the left wing and don't want them to get banned, so #bussy or #pavism is a better bet. @Gregor The Beggar you know Bussy is one thing why I support a state sponsored monopoly so capitalists like you would not create copies of my original joke. Further @Adithyansoccer you american scum, trying to profit out of my invention. @RMSteve I wish you don't worry on Adith, worry about you and bussy.

Dude
Why did he do that
Our polling next week is gonna be wayyyyyy down
Unless I write a tonne of press
I just want griffo to come back
Because I honestly hate the Liberals rn
I've been doing the fucking heavy lifting
Organising the Sydney campaign and his senate replacement
Writing press
..that isn't about 6 month old shit
And then without warming me or telling me
He goes and fucking condemns me
He said to me that my comments were fine as long as I didn't shit on a desk
And now he's fucked both of us

You probably have quite a few opinions about what's going on in the news cycle right now, but it's important to remember one thing: you're wrong. Here's why. To start, you're completely missing the point and everything you think is actually at odds with reality when you look at the data. In fact, you're nowhere close to being accurate. It's simple to understand when you stop for a second and actually look at the issues. Once you open your eyes, you'll see that you're wrong about each and every one of them, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. "But what about this other thing I heard?" No, if the past is any indication of the future, not only is there no chance that you'll ever be right, all signs suggest you will never even come close once in your lifetime. The only way you'll ever be right is to repeat everything I say word-for-word to every single person you know. Until then, you're wrong.﻿

You probably have quite a few opinions about what's going on in the news cycle right now, but it's important to remember one thing: you're wrong. Here's why. To start, you're completely missing the point and everything you think is actually at odds with reality when you look at the data. In fact, you're nowhere close to being accurate. It's simple to understand when you stop for a second and actually look at the issues. Once you open your eyes, you'll see that you're wrong about each and every one of them, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. "But what about this other thing I heard?" No, if the past is any indication of the future, not only is there no chance that you'll ever be right, all signs suggest you will never even come close once in your lifetime. The only way you'll ever be right is to repeat everything I say word-for-word to every single person you know. Until then, you're wrong.﻿

Whoa there buddy. You need to save some of this for your valedictorian speech when you graduate from Buzzkill University with that double PhD in Unnecessary Negativity and Taking Things Too Seriously.
Also, if you're practicing for the Ruin The Fun Contest, don't bother because they won't let professionals compete, let alone multiple Olympic gold-winning medalists

Mr speaker, can i put my balls in yo jaw. (yo jaw). Ball ins you jaw. Cani can i cani put my balls in your jaw.

Uwu ligma balls hehehehe cum in me mummy

Mr president, this gouvmt is quite strong because unlike the soft beta male/female cucks known as the socualsts and the gedrnss the commonwealth party is a party of big cock alpha males who will dominate the submissive and breedable socialists. Mr president, i strongly believe that maxwild (me) should be pr ime minister because lucy has a greyhound which i will be promptly executing (known professionally as model-bug) and 

First of all that brings us to the economy. Now naturally since this is a left wing dominated government the economy will take a nosedive immediately after we are all sworn in. i do not care about thee economy currently  ecaue we can solve this with the commonwealth party policy of killing the poor. Lining them all up for them to be shot. Speaking of which merrily ptrid is the salt of the earth and she should die. 

Now national security. We will “restirct immigration to stop overpopulation (too many ethnics)” and continue policy of  blowing up refugees . boat.s

Next we move on to education. Now republics are shit and they are all shit so we should bring back the monarchy by insittuing monarchist education, as middle finger to gregor_the_beggar and his homosexual agenda.
