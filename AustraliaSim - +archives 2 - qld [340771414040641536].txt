[19-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'd call it a bag, although port was often used by the adults


[19-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and it was a 'port rack'


[19-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed was reading something today about it and that schoolbags are called port by Queenslanders maybe an older term


[19-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
port is common but mostly in the teachers to refer to it
