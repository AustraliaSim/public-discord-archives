[02-May-21 06:02 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
hello Ellie


[02-May-21 06:02 PM] Inactive#5702
Hello, Timothee


[02-May-21 06:02 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Tonight is shaping up to be one that will shock and surprise many


[02-May-21 06:02 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
With no polling, as it seems all polling companies have taken annual leave


[02-May-21 06:02 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
We actually have no idea about what is going on in the hearts and minds of voters


[02-May-21 06:03 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
There are many seats where the results will most likely shock us


[02-May-21 06:03 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
And the home seat of our office, the Division of Nicholls, will be a hard fought contest, that will it seems, come down completely to the line


[02-May-21 06:04 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
There are few safe seats, where we definitely know the results


[02-May-21 06:04 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
And it seems with a resurgent SDP, anything is possible in this new era


[02-May-21 06:04 PM] Inactive#5702
Nicholls is certainly a constituency where the fighting between parties has been made obvious.


[02-May-21 06:05 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Entirely so, it really showcased the worst in Green Left Co-Leader and sitting MP, Kyosanto and Democrats Leader and former Deputy Prime Minister Matthias Caesar


[02-May-21 06:05 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Which is surprising considering such cordial relations prior to this


[02-May-21 06:05 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It was absolutely a shock to me to hear that Matthias was running in Nicholls, what are your thoughts Ellie?


[02-May-21 06:06 PM] Inactive#5702
I think it's a continuation of the seat changing that is quite common in this era of Australian politics. We see it all the time, usually under that similar guise of "returning home". I think however it was a poor move for the leader if he wishes to remain in Parliament.


[02-May-21 06:08 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I agree entirely, if Matt loses, which is possible tonight, he‚Äôll have made the worst political choice of his life. With the Democrats losing perhaps their best Leader in history. Matthias really took the Democrats out of the status of minor party, and catapulted them into major party status, and put themselves ahead of the SDP and GLP in being the only possible opposition


[02-May-21 06:09 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I think the best choice that could have been made was to instead stay in Canberra, and run the campaign from there, with a much higher chance of winning more seats, and gaining the premier status as largest party


[02-May-21 06:09 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
This also would have prevented the bad blood that now exists, and would perhaps have seen the Green Left preferencing the Nationals last instead in the Senate


[02-May-21 06:09 PM] Inactive#5702
I certainly agree.


[02-May-21 06:09 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
If Green Left Co-Leader loses, it will be interesting to see what path the GLP takes


[02-May-21 06:10 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Will TheTrashMan take the reigns of Leader in the House?


[02-May-21 06:10 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Only time will tell, and many pundits are predicting that Trash won‚Äôt win


[02-May-21 06:11 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
This could truly be the death of the Green Left party, a far left experiment that failed to capitalise on their murder of the Social Democrats, and assert themselves ahead of the SDP.


[02-May-21 06:11 PM] Inactive#5702
This election is a reality check for several of the parties, having their leader on the line due to poor strategy and fighting.


[02-May-21 06:12 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Very true, it seems that only the SDP have learnt the lesson of connecting with voters and building strong connections in local areas, meaning that they win comfortable every time.


[02-May-21 06:12 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
While Ky≈çsant≈ç has promised to not leave Nicholls if not re-elected, is this really a promise someone in this climate can keep?


[02-May-21 06:12 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Now to look at the two other candidates, the ones we endorsed!


[02-May-21 06:13 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Frod and Merrily, originally written off as unimportant in a race between two leaders, they‚Äôve demonstrated strong clean campaigning


[02-May-21 06:13 PM] Inactive#5702
Surprising that one of the most controversial people on the Twitter-sphere has created an influential campaign in Nicholls.


[02-May-21 06:14 PM] inactive#6974
*surfs in*


[02-May-21 06:14 PM] inactive#6974
*surfs out*


[02-May-21 06:14 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It truly is, someone known for their controversial, homophobic and sometimes racist tweets is now seen as a real progressive choice. Perhaps voters just don‚Äôt care enough about social media rants these days and the cancel culture that exists around them


[02-May-21 06:15 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I honestly would not be all surprised if Merrily or Frod won Nicholls


[02-May-21 06:15 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
But enough about Nicholls I think


[02-May-21 06:15 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Let‚Äôs look at the National picture


[02-May-21 06:16 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Which seemingly lacks a lot of strong Nationals house candidates


[02-May-21 06:16 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
A complete strategy reversal of them to focus solely on the senate


[02-May-21 06:17 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
However, this strategy seeks to exist as one of revenge, demanding total right wing control of the senate to deny any legislation passing


[02-May-21 06:17 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
and also allowed Griffonomics to scamper out of Denison when the heat got too hot!


[02-May-21 06:17 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
What do you think Ellie @Inactive


[02-May-21 06:18 PM] Inactive#5702
It seems to be sacrificing a position in Government for a position where they have influence in deciding the agenda of the Parliament. It is interesting, but I'm not sure it is one that is wise. It has the risk of easily falling on its head if they don't manage to reach the required Senate quota.


[02-May-21 06:18 PM] Inactive#5702
Putting all your eggs in one basket is never the way to go.


[02-May-21 06:19 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I agree, however, this Senate campaign has been intriguing


[02-May-21 06:19 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Almost nothing from the Liberals, SDP or CLP, it seems to be a fight between the Aus Dems, Nationals and Green Left, all parties that don‚Äôt particularly get along, and are all selling themselves away here


[02-May-21 06:20 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
My prediction is


[02-May-21 06:20 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It‚Äôs impossible for any of us to know to be honest


[02-May-21 06:20 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I have no idea


[02-May-21 06:21 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
At the very least we should see Griffonomics win a seat and Slater be re-elected


[02-May-21 06:21 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
But even then


[02-May-21 06:21 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
We‚Äôre not too sure


[02-May-21 06:22 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
The only definitive things in this election campaign have been, 
1. Inter party fighting
2. Back room deals of selling out
3. Poor choices from leadership of all parties


[02-May-21 06:23 PM] Inactive#5702
I agree entirely.


[02-May-21 06:23 PM] Inactive#5702
It is a poor showing in Nicholls for public trust in parties.


[02-May-21 06:23 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Yup.


[02-May-21 06:24 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I doubt that we‚Äôll see much happiness and joy from voters in regards to that


[02-May-21 06:24 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
But with 5 minutes to go until results are released, we won‚Äôt have to wait too long


[02-May-21 06:24 PM] Inactive#5702
Indeed.


[02-May-21 06:25 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I‚Äôm sure there will at the very least, be a lot of sad and angry candidates, and a few incumbents losing.


[02-May-21 06:25 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
But


[02-May-21 06:25 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
All shall be revealed in due time I assume


[02-May-21 06:25 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Any final predictions from yourself Ellie?


[02-May-21 06:26 PM] Inactive#5702
Not from me.


[02-May-21 06:26 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Well


[02-May-21 06:26 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It‚Äôs hard to do so


[02-May-21 06:27 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
There is a great chance the Times of Ballarat predictions will end up in some online cringe compilation of sorts


[02-May-21 06:27 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Goodnight from myself, and thanks to Ellie Cavendish for coming on tonight


[02-May-21 06:28 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087

Original name I know


[09-May-21 09:37 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
So in the last week we saw an election, an expected result, and the return of the same faces to parliament, the loss of one big one, and a scattering of new ones


[09-May-21 09:37 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
So what exactly did happen?


[09-May-21 09:39 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Well, as everyone knows by down, the ploy by the Nationals to move all their funding to an upper house campaign was less than ideal for the benefits of a democratic nation, and resulted in a left wing majority, now this  would have normally resulted in a left wing coalition, and a return to style and past for the centrist parties as they reassert themselves as the opposition the right can‚Äôt be


[09-May-21 09:40 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Alas, this did not occur, as we now see the SDP Right factional warlord, Mikiboss as Prime Minister, and broadly understand to be an Aus Dem Left member, Hagrid as Deputy Prime Minister


[09-May-21 09:41 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
A sort of middle ground coalition to appeal to what may soon become a hostile Senate


[09-May-21 09:41 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Though, it seems Mikiboss chose this path as the only way to avoid both National and Democrat opposition in the Senate which would have crushed any legislation


[09-May-21 09:43 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
We have one message coming on our SMS like (DM @ky≈çsant≈ç ) saying 

> ‚Äúit‚Äôs ironic that a campaign against the left wing by Hagrid in both Hotham and Denison has ended up in him propping up a left wing government, continuously at the behest of a far left party.‚Äù

What an absolutely intriguing comment... üòê


[09-May-21 09:43 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
‚ÄúSo true‚Äù as many people might put it


[09-May-21 09:44 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Now this may be hypocrisy, but alas, it‚Äôs the usual hypocrisy from politicians


[09-May-21 09:44 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
And we as voters should expect no less


[09-May-21 09:44 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
The Democrats once a party above the rest, has since fallen to the tried and true method of infighting and factionalism, which is true of most parties


[09-May-21 09:46 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
The SDP since losing a good chunk of their left wing faction, as had a much easier time negotiating with otherwise ideological opposites, however with a return of ARTB to parliament will we see a resurgence in left wing opposition to the current status quo? Remains to be seen.


[09-May-21 09:47 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
So, what will happen this term?


[09-May-21 09:47 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Times of Ballarat prediction:
Not much.


[09-May-21 09:47 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
We will see moderate changes made and moderate reforms passed, nothing to the left of SDP Right, and nothing to the right of Aus Dem Left.


[09-May-21 09:48 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Circling back, we now have a Green Left opposition. Now how exactly this will work, is unknown, the Green Left Party doesn‚Äôt really oppose the SDP or the Aus Dems that much, besides for some slight backstabbing and shittalking, but alas, that is as many people are saying, water under the bridge.


[09-May-21 09:50 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
So what can one expect then, besides minimal opposition? Not a whole lot.


[09-May-21 09:51 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
There are some vocal fat Left voices in the Green Left Party, but the moderate leadership, who are largely at odds with the wills and wants of membership, are expected to probably keep this under wraps


[09-May-21 09:52 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
With access to some leaked documents we know that an SDP-GL coalition would‚Äôve seen Senator Slater as Deputy Prime Minister, instead of the Member for Nicholls, who would‚Äôve been relegated to Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.


[09-May-21 09:53 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
This interesting document contains a lot of, interesting choices, seen in a way to appease the Democrats after a bitter backstabbing


[09-May-21 09:55 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It seems that outside of this, there have been no attempts by Matthias Caesar to apologise for his apparent jump to unseat the Leader of Green Left, though we make ask, is this something we should expect?


[09-May-21 09:56 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It seems every election in Nicholls, there is a concerted effort by someone to unseat or stop Ky≈çsant≈ç, all of three of which have been unsuccessful


[09-May-21 09:56 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Is there perhaps an underlying secret behind all this, or do people like taking advantage of a Member so open about his struggles with mental illness?


[09-May-21 09:58 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
This has happened before, with former Member for Robertson and Democrats Leader Jayden Williamson facing a backstabbing, a member also known for being an outspoken advocate for mental illness and better access to mental health services


[09-May-21 09:59 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Perhaps this is correlation without causation and preying on the vulnerable people in parliament is a complete accident


[09-May-21 09:59 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Who knows !


[09-May-21 10:01 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
However


[09-May-21 10:01 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
We do know that this Parliament will be extremely underwhelming


[09-May-21 10:01 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It will be a rubber stamp, do things by the book Government


[09-May-21 10:01 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
and there will be little in the way of controversy and issue


[09-May-21 10:02 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It‚Äôs doubtful that this term will seen an *event* like the last two did that so shockingly impacted things


[09-May-21 10:03 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
The most vocal anti-Government voices are currently locked in litigation as they try to say the election was illegitimate, not unlike a certain United States president !


[09-May-21 10:04 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
However, I truly doubt we will see any popular action taken to overthrow or overcome this Government. With little chance of a rally going rogue


[09-May-21 10:07 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
We‚Äôll now open the line (m: DM me) for any comments or questions


[09-May-21 10:12 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087

From a poor election performance in January to a stunning result in May, the Social Democrats will be happy with this.

[01-Jun-21 09:00 PM] inactive#6974
I don't know where this surge in support for the Liberals has come from, considering their 1 MP is in a city electorate in Queensland. Horror-HQ was elected as a Liberal in July 2020, and immediately defected to the Social Democrats, so have the closet Liberal voters been hiding?


[01-Jun-21 09:00 PM] inactive#6974
Could this be due to the strong stance in support of coal and nuclear the Liberals have taken?


[01-Jun-21 09:01 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Well, quite possibly...


[01-Jun-21 09:01 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087

Nicholls has enjoyed the representation of model-ky≈çsant≈ç since November 2020, ending a period of instability with Horror-HQ and Edenhopestan.
It's not a surprise to see a strong result, and considering these was once seen as a battleground seat, model-ky≈çsant≈ç should be able to have some breathing room for next election, given preferences would likely flow from Country Labor and the Social Democrats.


[01-Jun-21 09:03 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087

[04-Jul-21 08:08 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
The announcement of a new Public Hospital was welcomed by the local communities, as the fast growing area, which will be home to 500,000 people in the next 20 years, lacks many services as suburban sprawl outpaces government ability to accurately give services to the region.

The hospital is expected to begin construction sometime before the middle of 2022, and be fully operational by 2026. Currently the 160,000 Melton residents are forced to use the scandal ridden Bacchus Marsh Hospital, or nearby Sunshine Hospital, which both involve longer commutes, and high ambulance response times.

> This is a great step forward, and I am hopeful that it can be delivered ahead of schedule, the fast growing region is in dire need of more services, and if the State Governments can barely keep up, the the Federal Government needs to be stepping in. I hope that the SDP will look into allocating money towards this project so that it can be fast tracked, and deliver essential services to this community.

While poor planning is something that plagues the Western Suburbs, Melton especially has been unable to cope with its fast growth, with the town centre inadequate, and detached single family homes making up the vast majority of housing in the area, and stores largely located in a singular shopping centre surrounded by car parks, there is also a severe lack of transport options.

With Ballarat Line V/Line services now serving more and more Melton area stations since the opening of Cobblebank, which will serve the new Hospital. Many people have been calling out for quadruplication to Melton, and electrification, so that frequent and higher capacity Metro services can serve the fast growing city.

It‚Äôs obvious that more needs to be done regarding the allocation of services, however, it seems that this issue will largely remain ignored so long as Melton is stigmatised in the media and with the general public as being a home of extreme poverty and drug addiction.

The political scene so far has been dominated by the Governments plan to impeach the entire High Court bench, which has been widely praised by Parliamentarians; but does it resonate with the general public, we remain unsure. 
There has also been grassroots campaigns placed against Member for Brisbane 12MaxWild and his backflipping on the JobKeeper extension, as well as Senator Dyljam regarding Nuclear energy.

[08-Aug-21 08:01 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Whether these campaigns which seem to have the backing of a large group that once campaigned heavily against Country Labor, the Rural Australians Against the Nationals (RAAN) whereby now they are using what seems to be large amounts of funds and volunteer effort to put up posters in public to campaign against these two Parliamentarians. Whether this will have an actual impact will be unknown for the time being, as Senator Dyljam has made no comment on Nuclear Energy and the billboards placed up against him.

[08-Aug-21 08:03 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Besides this, a large campaign has appeared in Nicholls regarding Rosedale Shire Restoration, with a Bill being introduced into Parliament on the behalf of former Nicholls candidate @MerrilyPutrid


[08-Aug-21 08:04 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Whether Parliament believes that it‚Äôs their job to be restoring councils remains to be seen‚Ä¶

[08-Aug-21 08:10 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Another question is actually whether Parliament can do that!


[08-Aug-21 08:12 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Which is why I am inviting supposed legal expert and former Prime Minister, long serving Member of Parliament, and r*ral, @mikiboss on to discuss whether it‚Äôs possible!


[08-Aug-21 08:12 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087

[08-Aug-21 08:13 PM] mikiboss#2416
Spoiler alert: as it stands, they can't.


[08-Aug-21 08:13 PM] mikiboss#2416
And thank you for inviting me


[08-Aug-21 08:13 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Now that‚Äôs a blow to the current Bill in Parliament


[08-Aug-21 08:14 PM] mikiboss#2416
As it stands, the issue isn't really whether or not the amalgamation of councils is a good thing or not, I think we remember the condemnation of amalgamation in Queensland in the late 2000's, but local government being left out of the Constitution makes this question relatively easy to answer.


[08-Aug-21 08:17 PM] mikiboss#2416
It is one of the responsibilities which is seen as a uniquely internal issue, and one which the states themselves have the power to control, legislate, and regulate. Not only are the boundaries within a state, but their operation according to state construction and planning laws, financial frameworks, and method of election makes it, as it stands, an issue for the states, and one which has been seen as so for a while now.


[08-Aug-21 08:20 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
This is an issue it seems that is being rectified with SB2102 however, where the Government is moving to recognise local government in the Constitution. What the Government plans to do with powers regarding Local Government seems obvious considering their other Bill which is the Rosedale Shire Restoration one. 

I think it‚Äôs weird that there is such a movement towards such action, and also this Bill before Parliament which seeks to re-instate a local council, despite an inability to do so. Is this more of a vanity project perhaps?


[08-Aug-21 08:21 PM] mikiboss#2416
For me, I see this is less a vanity project, but one that does raise an interesting issue for the public by making an example of it. Should the commonwealth have the power to regulate and support local councils?

This has been an area of concern for a while now, particularly with some states taking moves in councils seen either as cost cutting, or as stacking councils, with the former being seen in some areas of New South Wales, and the Victorian Reforms in 2019-20. Reforms include giving the commonwealth the power to grant funding to councils, or to insert a section to checks the power of the states to decide on the structure of local government. All such reforms however hasn't manifested, or have been defeated at a referendum, such as in 88.


[08-Aug-21 08:22 PM] mikiboss#2416
I myself must admit, I think the proposal for local government recognition is a very solid debate, and while other constitutional questions remain central to everyday life, such as recognition of indigenous people and a Voice from the heart, it may be one speaking great interest for the future of our Federation.


[08-Aug-21 08:24 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I do from a personal aspect believe that Local Government is a very important function of our democratic institutions that is very often overlooked, however, is this referendum that the Greens are proposing the right way to do this?

This term seems to be the one involving a lot of constitutional alterations on the horizons, with the Infrastructure Bill from NGSpy, and then this Local Government one, so we might see quite the large referendum campaign and debate on these future and federation shaping issues.


[08-Aug-21 08:26 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
However I do note that there is quite the discrepancy between councils in differing states, with WA local councils being quite small, Queensland ones quite large, Victorian ones having an absolute mishmash of voting systems and NSW councils facing constant amalgamations and de-amalgamations.


[08-Aug-21 08:27 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
and that there is quite the argument to be made whether federal management of the issue is one way to unify the councils, and perhaps even the implementation of cross border councils is something we may see occur. Albury-Wodonga being an example that springs to mind where joint services already exist and a joint council could be very beneficial


[08-Aug-21 08:27 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
anyway, that‚Äôs all our time for tonight, as the newspoll awaits us on the horizon. (Unless you wanna say anything more Miki)

Look, obviously I have my personal thoughts on the matter, and the Greens ran a strong anti-nuclear campaign which was clearly highlighted. This poster does fail to recognise that there are more than one reason people may vote for a party. The use of the vote in Nicholls combined vote share of the Greens, Country Labor and model-putrid, and Hotham uses SprinklyDinks and the Greens.

While voters voted for anti-nuclear candidates, they aren't strictly voting for anti nuclear, but it is a policy that such candidates held and voters do accept this at the ballot box.

So completely unfair? No. Is it the most honest of posters? Also no.


[09-Aug-21 08:58 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087

The existence of TIG reflects embarrassingly on the SDP. Washed up former Prime Minister Youmaton, who is forever eclipsed by their Deputy Drunk_King_Robert, is somebody who has always been associated with the SDP vanity project. However, even now, they would rather start a new party than join Rohanite's Hashtag Clown Coterie

I must agree, it is quite weird that such iconic figures from the SDP have not returned to them once they come back from the wilderness


[09-Aug-21 09:07 PM] inactive#6974
TIG claims to be anti establishment and end party politics, unable to cite any cause for this, when party politics has proven positive in many cases and it's clear that they are now sitting on the base of the Australian Democrats polling and will soon see a significant drop as they rely on failed former bignames


[09-Aug-21 09:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
But essentially,  The Independent Group are not Independents. They are not a group, either. They are a party. Except they're a party without a coherent ideology, or policy, or plan, so essentially,  they exist as a vehicle to get members elected. Except, if you look at the polling, actual Independents poll higher!

Essentially, TIG has no reason to exist, and I am looking forward to thumping any of their members that run in Canberra next election.

The problem with the Socialist Party is, while it maintained remarkable influence throughout its existence, it only ever had two capable leaders. With them gone, all that remained was a soft membership who immediately sold out on principles.

[09-Aug-21 09:10 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And it was a rather strange decision to sell out in this way,  considering Bsharri and DKR both proved explicitly communist politicians could become Prime Minister

How do you think this differs from the centrism of the Australian Democrats who have flopped like Cardi?

The Australian Democrats had some good policies, but unfortunately their membership was made up of the most annoying people alive. This was alienating and led to their downfall.

People got  behind the slater train : üöÜ


[09-Aug-21 09:14 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I now invite TIG Leader, @Youmaton on to discuss their independent group party


[09-Aug-21 09:15 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Wow this studio is getting packed! Much like the High Court Bench after Prime Minister Slater is done.


[09-Aug-21 09:16 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Whether they click on the Zoom link or not I don‚Äôt know!


[09-Aug-21 09:16 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Now; do you endorse the Slater Government‚Äôs plan to fire the High Court Justices?


[09-Aug-21 09:16 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Yes.


[09-Aug-21 09:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Former PMs ought to be starting vanity political parties, not sitting on the Bench.


[09-Aug-21 09:17 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Too true!


[09-Aug-21 09:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Or, as a compromise, there could be some consistency, and Slater could appoint every former PM to the High Court


[09-Aug-21 09:18 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I think that may be an intriguing route to take !


[09-Aug-21 09:18 PM] inactive#6974
I will shit myself before the likes of Griffonomics holds any power in our judiciary and that's a promise


[09-Aug-21 09:20 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
So true besties!


[09-Aug-21 09:20 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Well


[09-Aug-21 09:20 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
We are wrapping this up


[09-Aug-21 09:20 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087

[09-Aug-21 09:21 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
What


[09-Aug-21 09:22 PM] Youmaton#1190
Oh?


[09-Aug-21 09:23 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Youma would you like to talk about the Independent Group?


[09-Aug-21 09:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
It seems that a certain someone has spent far too much time on this show attacking The Independent Group instead of supporting our local community. The Independent Group exists to give a platform for Independents to work together to get elected and work for their local communities. The fact we have achieved 10% in our first poll, only 8% behind the opposition, is incredible, and compounds further when you see the total independent voting support now sits at an incredible and record breaking 21%!


[09-Aug-21 09:27 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I would be inclined to agree, it does seem that there is perhaps some disagreements that relate more to personal issues from the past than policy disagreements!


[09-Aug-21 09:27 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Considering your great polling performance so far, do you believe there is a real chance for the Independent Group to excel in certain regions of Australia that are screaming out for a Independent to stand up to the establishment?


[09-Aug-21 09:27 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
This is false


[09-Aug-21 09:28 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Independents do not poll at 21%


[09-Aug-21 09:28 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
This is due to the fact that TIG is a party.


[09-Aug-21 09:28 PM] Youmaton#1190
You certainly don't, you poll far below that


[09-Aug-21 09:29 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You do not appear on the PPM at all


[09-Aug-21 09:30 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Whereas 7% of Australians would like me in the Lodge


[09-Aug-21 09:30 PM] Youmaton#1190
The Independent Group offers Independents an incredible platform to build their local campaigns, oust party politicians, and restore accountability to parliament. Be it Moncrieff, be it Mayo, be it Canberra, we are already starting to scare politicians, and we've only had a single poll.


[09-Aug-21 09:30 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And more Australians would vote for Independents over "Independents"


[09-Aug-21 09:30 PM] inactive#6974
Fun fact: TSC is the most popular independent in terms of PPM in a long time


[09-Aug-21 09:30 PM] inactive#6974
a long time possibly being ever


[09-Aug-21 09:30 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The fact that your party is only 2% ahead of me *personally* is a shocking condemnation of your vanity project party


[09-Aug-21 09:31 PM] Youmaton#1190
I believe Showstealer, Rommel and Explosivo obtained higher polls


[09-Aug-21 09:31 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
It seems Lucy has disconnected from the Zoom?


[09-Aug-21 09:31 PM] inactive#6974
explosivo reached 10% I apologise


[09-Aug-21 09:32 PM] inactive#6974
Rommel I can only find at 6%


[09-Aug-21 09:32 PM] Youmaton#1190
She was #NotReady for the feedback


[09-Aug-21 09:32 PM] inactive#6974
Showstealer was at 12% in 2019


[09-Aug-21 09:32 PM] Youmaton#1190
(m: why on earth did that reply to that message)


[09-Aug-21 09:32 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Now, Youma, this move largely comes as a retirement plan of sorts, whereas you used to be quite prominent in the SDP, why didn‚Äôt you want to return to the SDP?


[09-Aug-21 09:33 PM] Youmaton#1190
I disagree with the current direction of the SDP, particularly around its abandonment of its anti-nuclear founding stance.


[09-Aug-21 09:34 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Now, that‚Äôs quite the stance considering you are I believe the 2nd longest serving SDP Leader?


[09-Aug-21 09:35 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Oh hello NGSpy! How did you get the Zoom link


[09-Aug-21 09:35 PM] NGSpy#8096
Some associates sent them to me. Hello everyone.


[09-Aug-21 09:35 PM] NGSpy#8096
I hope you're all doing well.


[09-Aug-21 09:35 PM] Youmaton#1190
It was not a decision I wished to ever make, but one I knew I had to. Only a strong message such as a former Leaders condemnation can begin to heal the mess within the SDP as current


[09-Aug-21 09:37 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
NGSpy, while you‚Äôre here, do you have any comments regarding what Youma has said on the direction of the SDP?


[09-Aug-21 09:41 PM] NGSpy#8096
First of all, I shall ensure those watching that I will personally ensure that my constituents are represented through minor and major legislation and my votes. If I find something extremely damaging to my electorate then I shall seek to put it right. Many members voted against the redistribution of GST to be fairer on WA, which was not great. Most policies that the SDP introduced were reactionary to the needs of the people, and I will always put that as my priority. I think that the direction of the SDP has always been pro-people, and ultimately if the Victorian people do not want nuclear power then the Victorian government can represent that view.


[09-Aug-21 09:41 PM] NGSpy#8096
This goes with other states as well


[09-Aug-21 09:42 PM] NGSpy#8096
I do fundamentally believe in autonomy and having options, even if we don't necessarily exercise them for various reasons, like the people not wanting it.


[09-Aug-21 09:43 PM] NGSpy#8096
The SDP never voted for the imposition of nuclear power plants, just the allowance of them to happen. It's quite different if you think about it.


[09-Aug-21 09:44 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
But regarding Youma‚Äôs condemnation of the direction of the SDP, what sort of image do you think that paints of the modern SDP?


[09-Aug-21 09:45 PM] NGSpy#8096
Ultimately a condemnation does not make the entire view. Despite the SDP being condemned time and time again we have ensured policy is made for the people, and my electorate consistently vote for it. Ultimately it's accountability as well. We need it in our system.


[09-Aug-21 09:46 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Now, NGSpy, on a personal note, do you believe that your time in politics is coming to an end?


[09-Aug-21 09:47 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
There have been a wide number of rumblings regarding a nomination to the High Court, to the Presidency, what do you make of these, and would you accept such a thing?


[09-Aug-21 09:47 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I also ask the reverse question to @Youmaton , do you believe your time in politics (again) is just beginning?


[09-Aug-21 09:49 PM] Youmaton#1190
My time in politics is an ever-changing variable, and I will remain in the public scene as long as I believe it necessary to move our nation forward.


[09-Aug-21 09:53 PM] NGSpy#8096
I have been thinking about moving on for a while. I have been the longest serving MP consecutively since the incident of 2017 and I do really enjoy representing the people of Pearce in parliament and see it as a duty that I ensure their voice is heard. I have legislated to ensure that miners in Western Australia have a means to transition, and I have ensured that they are not neglected in the chambers.

I would not accept a nomination to the High Court of Australia, as I am not a legal expert and do not want to contribute to partisanship. I feel that the Presidency would have to depend on how I feel as an MP: is it right for the people of Pearce to rely on me for so long or do they need new blood and new ideas, ya know? I am also quite old for a penguin! üòõ


[09-Aug-21 09:54 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
I would say that you should both be proud of your contributions but sometimes there does need to be an end.


[09-Aug-21 09:54 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
NGSpy do you worry that if you eventually leave the political scene that the SDP may collapse upon itself?


[09-Aug-21 09:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
Indeed. I'll give it my all this term and fix things up that I need to. ACOM-HELP and ensuring that health infrastructure is spread out shall come soon!


[09-Aug-21 09:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
I think that Rohanite will be able to continue the message of the SDP quite adequately, as long as he listens to his colleagues opinions and the people's.


[09-Aug-21 09:56 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Anyway, as NGSpy has turned off his camera, I believe it‚Äôs time to wrap this up.


[09-Aug-21 09:57 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Goodnight Western Victoria, and the approximately 300,000 people who had the ability to tune in tonight, including the cities of Ballarat, Ararat and Warrnambool.

The Social Democrats have never had a formalised factional structure unlike their predecessor Labor, which had 3 factions, that battled it out. However since NGSpy took the leadership reigns, it‚Äôs become clear how they‚Äôve shaped out, despite their unofficial-ness.
