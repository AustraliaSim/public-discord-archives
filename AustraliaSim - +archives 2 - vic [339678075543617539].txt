how many seats do the greens get before Labor need them for c and s


[18-Nov-17 10:10 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
and how many til the greens start demanding a coalition

your thoughts @RunasSudo @showstealer1829 @Deleted User @Harold


[18-Nov-17 10:12 PM] RunasSudo#2416
in a surprise twist, One Nation forms government before either of those things happens 👀


[18-Nov-17 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
with this one I think Labor have a seat majority or something?

the Greens are winning at Labor's expense


[18-Nov-17 10:15 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
largely


[18-Nov-17 10:16 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I don't think there's any doubt they'll will Brunswick, and they seem a shoe-in for Richmond too. Prahran might be a little trickier: the Libs are unpopular rn but it is Prahran we're talking about.


[18-Nov-17 10:17 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
But if they got all 3, that'd give them 5/88 seats.


[18-Nov-17 10:22 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I think that it's more than likely that this current Labor government will be the last one they ever have without the Greens giving them c and s/coalition.

Victorian restaurants fined $354,504 for food safety breaches
Utensils smeared with remnants of past patron's meals, dingy, dark kitchens, and contaminated food – these are just some of the convictions recorded against some of Victoria's worst offending restaurants.

VCE discussion space is a mess aha - It’s alright now with the new set of Year 12s asking Q’s, textbooks being sold and Uni offers coming out. But during the year that place was toxic. I must admit however, I did enjoy all the memes that were posted following exams and the GAT. Any Uni FB groups?

It crashed a couple of times. Yeah it was mainly about finding where to park the car, and then walking through the campus to South One Theatre and Menzies building (the two of which were pretty close to one another). As we parked the car towards the top of the campus it was just about getting down


[19-Jan-18 03:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
ooo yeah, in the multistory park?

You say that, but La Trobe is lovely. Big campus with all manner of facilities and a **moat**. If you have to go to a not-academically-renowned university, you may as well go to a pretty one.

La Trobe is my closest uni, been there countless times (VCE revision lectures) and where a chunk of my mates have gone. But after orientation yesterday I’m more than happy with Monash atm 😛

Hello all. I have a cold and cannot make it to two shows at the comedy festival tonight, and my mum refuses to go alone. Subsequently, I have 2x tickets to Lawrence Mooney's A Evening with Malcolm Turnbull at 5:45 in the Athenaeum and 2x tickets to Phil Wang's Kinabalu at 7:15 in the Melbourne Town Hall that I can't use. Do any of you want them?


[08-Apr-18 04:00 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I offer 4 free goddamn tickets to comedy shows, and do I get any responses?


[08-Apr-18 04:00 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
No.

fun fact: last week I was ill, this week mum is ill

therefore, I have a ticket to see Lano and Woodley and 7:30, but you'll have to see it with me

this has happened before, I took runas to see Black Panther and I didn't even bite any of his limbs off

Attention Victorians @CircleSongIsDank#9960 @Harold @Electrum @Rat @LuSing My Religion @RunasSudo @TheMontyJohnson @Gesman5000 @AnswerMeNow2 

I am appearing in a production of The Mikado in July at some theatre in Preston, in which I will dress in Japanese clothing and sing poorly. If any of you would like to be there, let me know and I can get you tickets for cheap (until May 31st). Students $24, under 16s $18. 

These are the dates:
Thursday 19th July 8:00pm
Friday 20th July 8:00pm
Saturday 21st July 2:00pm
Saturday 21st July 8:00pm
Sunday 22nd July 2:00pm

The best part it is you can attend anonymously and I won't know it's you, so no doxxing. Hooray!


[27-May-18 12:25 AM] Hoog#6115
we should figure out the date that works for most of us so we can go together

@Electrum @Harold @Hoog @Rat @RunasSudo hello chums,

Electrums is a bitch and can't do weekends so can we do a week day? If so, I think it can be pretty much any day for the rest of June apart from maybe Hoog's exam days on the 12th, 19th, and 21st, is that right Hoog?


[10-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Hoog#6115
aye, that be right


[10-Jun-18 08:42 PM] RunasSudo#2416
12th and 14th are bad days for me


[10-Jun-18 08:42 PM] RunasSudo#2416
And I'm leaving on the 16th so rip me


[10-Jun-18 08:43 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

[15-Jun-18 05:42 PM] Hoog#6115
Need to get that first


[15-Jun-18 05:43 PM] Hoog#6115
And you'd have to allow trucks still


[15-Jun-18 05:44 PM] Hoog#6115
and you'd need significant improvements to all our metro stations


[15-Jun-18 05:45 PM] Hoog#6115
Including more parking spaces at outer suburb stations


[15-Jun-18 05:45 PM] Hoog#6115

Attention Victhots: 2 of my friends can't go to my musical on Friday at 8pm until 11pm so there are now 2 free concessions up for grabalitos. PM me if you're interested.

@Rat interesting theory on the false flag, in times of instability people will tend to vote for the incumbent party so you may be right that it was done to shore up votes

Did you get your mandatory $1.6k fine today loyal citizen. Remember, don't criticise Comrade Andrews, he will send you to die in the oil fields in the country if you're not compliant.

Glen Eira is a good area. A few one bedroom apartments around that are about 200 pw.

They're not flash, but they provide shelter from the poor people.

I find it interesting that PC is looking at a Federation House when he graduates when a year after grad I am potentially going to have to enlist leaving my three pets to die without me being there because I need to support my family.


[15-Apr-20 10:45 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
well not a whole house


[15-Apr-20 10:45 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
I would imagine that Melbourne subdivides houses like that


[15-Apr-20 10:45 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
they do that sometimes in Brisbane


[15-Apr-20 10:46 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Plus I would probably rent with someone to cut costs


[15-Apr-20 10:46 PM] SocialistAcid#2094

[15-Apr-20 10:47 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
You’re an engineer too right ?


[15-Apr-20 10:47 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
environmental engineering is epic


[15-Apr-20 10:49 PM] SocialistAcid#2094
Nope. Policy specialist after my postgraduate studies. However, I am becoming dissolutioned with my course as most of what my lecturer says is, 'the conservatives destroyed this planet, so let's look into this dusty tome to find their secrets.'


[15-Apr-20 10:50 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244

I will be looking for council and government jobs when I finish.

I would imagine you could do something niche as post grad


[15-Apr-20 10:50 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244

Are they charging you for being born?


[15-Apr-20 10:59 PM] mikiboss#2416
well the difference could be several hundred thousand dollars, so good thing to clear it up


[15-Apr-20 10:59 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244

It’s absolutely trash for JAFFYs


[20-Apr-20 04:34 PM] mikiboss#2416
Yeah, but us Jaffys deserve it


[20-Apr-20 04:34 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
They should be given an opt in if they get good grades


[20-Apr-20 04:35 PM] Hoog#6115
Yeah but it’s an understandable compromise


[20-Apr-20 04:36 PM] Hoog#6115
Unis are shit on this issue


[20-Apr-20 04:36 PM] Hoog#6115
We had a really good proposal go to academic board and it got voted down


[20-Apr-20 04:37 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
I doubt it would be hard for UniMelb do accept the possibility to make a WAM benchmark for a JAFFY

Apparently the 4 officer that perished on the Eastern Freeway were, 1 female, 3 males. There was a trainee amongst them.
The Police are pursuing questions from the Truck driver that failed to observe the 40km/h rule.


[23-Apr-20 09:26 AM] RMSteve#7137
Wait, so how did it happen?


[23-Apr-20 09:26 AM] RMSteve#7137
Was it the truck driver's fault?


[23-Apr-20 09:26 AM] RMSteve#7137
Or someone else's?


[23-Apr-20 10:15 AM] SocialistAcid#2094
I heard he went into the emergency lane and failed to stop. The 3 officer and one trainee were crushed.


[23-Apr-20 10:16 AM] SocialistAcid#2094
I hope the trainee is posthumously promoted.

Bella is a beautiful girl, unbelievably sweet and loving. She is so easy to handle and a joy to have around. She is a super smart lady. Bella is awesome on the lead. Bella is also a bit of a water baby.  She would be a perfect companion for someone who likes to be active. Her new home must have lots of toys and balls. Bella is obsessed with them.  They keep her entertained and make her happy. Bella will also expect you to enjoy them as well. She is known to beg and plead with her gorgeous brown eyes until you give in.

Council chastised for use of ratepayer funds on espresso martinis, ...
Victoria's Ombudsman says senior managers at Warrnambool City Council "could and should" have done more after learning of credit card misuse to purchase alcohol, massages and "travel coinciding with football games".

[20-May-21 01:50 AM] doctor#0002
What’s the difference


[20-May-21 01:52 AM] mikiboss#2416
> A senior source close to the planning for the second safe-injecting room, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said proponents had learnt lessons from the state’s first medically supervised safe-injecting room in North Richmond.
> 
> “[The CBD facility] will be discreet,” they said. “This is a service where the injecting component within it is less than 10 per cent of the floor space.”
> 
> The North Richmond centre, nestled between Richmond West Primary School and a public housing estate, has attracted passionate protests from school parents and neighbours. In separate incidents in March, a man’s body was found near the grounds of the school and another man allegedly entered the site with a knife.
> 
> But it has also been credited with being a public health success story. In the first 18 months of the trial, 300 people were screened for hepatitis C and some were treated after testing positive. Staff made about 13,000 referrals to services such as the Fitzroy Legal Service in the same period.


[20-May-21 01:55 AM] doctor#0002
So basically smaller


[20-May-21 01:55 AM] mikiboss#2416
> Melbourne’s second safe-injecting room on Flinders Street is likely to be modelled on Sydney’s smaller, discreet facility and, along with measures to win over local traders, will include community health services.
literally first line smh


[20-May-21 01:56 AM] doctor#0002

[20-May-21 01:57 AM] mikiboss#2416

[20-May-21 02:20 AM] doctor#0002
Instead of a big green building that’s basically begging users to come inside


[20-May-21 02:20 AM] doctor#0002
especially for a city area


[20-May-21 02:20 AM] doctor#0002
hope it doesn’t get too busy considering it’s smaller and in a busy area


[20-May-21 02:24 AM] mikiboss#2416
Truth be told I lean more towards the Richmond proposal, because I think it's a situation where you kinda have to bite the bullet and go big on it
