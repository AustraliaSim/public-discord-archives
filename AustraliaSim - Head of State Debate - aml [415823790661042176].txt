It seems that the republicans are planning something


[24-Feb-18 09:15 PM] Ash#8178
They could be trying to force a referendum

I believe Forza joined the coalition initially because they promised republicanism, so I heard anyway


[24-Feb-18 09:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Republicanism could be quite disastrous...

Hence why everyone needs to run a strong campaign. All current MPs and Senators need to be active in the house get those modifiers

So ehat are the delegates doing to prevent this?


[13-May-18 06:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not going to lie am disappointed with those of you in the convention. More than just Dicky in there as well


[13-May-18 06:37 PM] Ash#8178
I was quite busy during the weekend


[13-May-18 06:37 PM] Ash#8178
I apologise for not attending the vote


[13-May-18 06:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah ok but did any of you make opening speeches as well? Is there an automatic ping?


[13-May-18 06:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because if you don't get pinged then that should be raised


[13-May-18 06:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's a big issue


[13-May-18 06:55 PM] Ash#8178
We did get a ping


[13-May-18 06:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok


[13-May-18 06:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh well plenty of time to delay, discourage and push for something that ensures as little change as possible and one that does not have the President with head mod powers


[13-May-18 07:05 PM] Ash#8178
If the bill doesn’t pass the house, will the convention restart all business?


[13-May-18 07:05 PM] Ash#8178
@Deleted User


[13-May-18 07:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
No that will be the end


[13-May-18 07:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
They could start a new convention though


[13-May-18 07:06 PM] Ash#8178
We might have the numbers in the house


[13-May-18 07:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
I doubt it


[13-May-18 07:07 PM] Ash#8178
2 govt members + 5 opposition members + 1 CA member


[13-May-18 07:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah ok maybe


[13-May-18 07:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then the aim is to get a ridiculous bill to propose


[13-May-18 07:08 PM] Ash#8178
I’m not completely sure about Viado or Electrums though


[13-May-18 07:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Viado surely wouldn't Electrums could go either way


[13-May-18 10:12 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
iirc Electrum is a monarchist


[13-May-18 10:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
cool


[14-May-18 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
should we try to stall the convention as much as possible?

Motion doesn't force the government to do anything


[06-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Ash#8178
@Deleted User pc did promise a republic if the motion passed


[06-Jul-18 06:07 PM] Ash#8178
*referendum


[06-Jul-18 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
It means he will be breaking another promise

[24-Jul-18 08:06 PM] Ash#8178
Why @PineappleCrusher_


[24-Jul-18 08:06 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
He voted against the strict party line

He isn't in the cabinet anymore


[24-Jul-18 08:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
We can ignore it


[24-Jul-18 08:07 PM] Ash#8178
It would’ve gotten a majority anyway


[24-Jul-18 08:07 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
there was a parliamentary motion


[24-Jul-18 08:07 PM] Ash#8178
It doesn’t matter


[24-Jul-18 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Motions don't force anyone to do anything


[24-Jul-18 08:07 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
We could say that the senate didn’t agree to it


[24-Jul-18 08:07 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
And block it there

[27-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
I agree, the monarchy not only was recently tested in that referendum, but if one is to happen, I would assume that would be around the time Prince Charles becomes king, thus skewing the result away from a monarchist referendum, into a popularity contest


[27-Jan-19 05:30 PM] Harold#5441

[27-Jan-19 05:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Eh, at least with an election you can argue that *some* people will vote along policy lines. Less so with a poll about Charles


[27-Jan-19 05:34 PM] Harold#5441
I'd vote for a republic, but I'm not sure what system of republic I'd prefer. Maybe where the "President" is called a Chancellor


[27-Jan-19 05:34 PM] Harold#5441
But I'd not like them to be appointed by parliament or by public vote in a politicised way

I'd be happy with a compromise. We bring Prince William to Australia and he is crowned King of Australia and lives here


[27-Jan-19 06:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
