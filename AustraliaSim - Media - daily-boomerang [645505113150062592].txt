**Mike:** Well, that happened. So now let‚Äôs get to one of the key races of the night, one which is likely to upset the left throughout the country; Cowper. Through the week a poll released saw the vote at: 

AussieConservative: 59%
MerrilyPutrid: 34%
UrbanRedneck007: 7%

Whilst the gap between the two major candidates, Nationals founder and former parliamentarian Griffo and union boss MerrilyPutrid was large, it is likely to have narrowed but most likely not enough to prevent him from winning the seat.

The UDP holds the cards this election, and seeing as they have preferenced the SDP, we predict an SDP win on these numbers:

This first seat currently belongs to the Founder of the Nationals and Australia‚Äôs most well known politician, AussieConservative. He‚Äôs putting up a fight against union thug MerrilyPutrid who has received endorsements from radical socialist parties such as the SDP. Most recent polling shows the Nationals retaining the seat on 52% to Merrily‚Äôs 48% however as the campaign went on, AussieConservative was more frequently seen out and about whilst Merrily appeared to be absent, so we‚Äôre calling this one a **NATIONAL RETAIN** with a rough 55% vote share for AussieConservative.

Held by the leader of the Nationals, Riley8583 is facing off competition from the somewhat communist DennisFox, who proposed a bunch of radical changes. Many voters in the electorate have voiced their support for their MP in a variety of newspaper forums and it appears Dennis poses no real challenge to Riley thus we call it a **NATIONAL RETAIN**

Our first three way race of the night, it‚Äôs being contested by Labor, the SDP and the Nationals. No polls have come from this seat despite it being the most marginal seat in the country with an outgoing MP which is quite interesting. The Nationals ManlyKittem has put up a splendid campaign, going against the mainstream Nationals slogan and basing his campaign on local issues, titled ‚ÄúGetting Hard for Cunningham‚Äù. I‚Äôm feeling a SDP vs National vibe in this seat with Labor preferences handing it to the SDP.

For the first time in a while, former Prime Minister and deposed SDP leader Youmaton has faced some competition from the Nationals candidate Elleeit. Polls came out and showed this:

[11-Jan-20 03:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
DexterAamo was absent from the campaign and Youmaton was seen less than we have previously in other elections, most likely due to the fact that she resigned from the SDP leadership and made an excellent choice to give it to MattMonti, a move which could be seen as easily handing the right the election. What also should be noted is that Elleeit displayed a consistent campaign and proved to be well likeable amongst the electorate, thus we believe the figures may end up looking like this.

This race has proven to be a close one and in turn our poll machine grants 70% of lib votes to the nationals in preferences, meaning a two party preferred would look like: 
Elleeit: 51.11%

The Treasurer, who put up a strong campaign and talked about soil was once again up against Zak6858, except this time he was an independent. Despite putting up a strong locally based campaign, we feel this was not enough to knock PC off his ground and are predicting the result to be 53% to 47%. A **LIBERAL RETAIN**

The strongest campaigning was seen here with a hot contest between the Libs, Nats and SDP. The Nationals did not invest too much resources in this seat and the candidate was quite disappointing in an election where the Nationals really have nothing to lose. With a fierce campaign from former Senator Ellielia and the Liberals, the SDP struggled to fight to keep their leader from remaining out of parliament as he does now, and if they lose it will be an embarrassment for the party and an embarrassment as a test of his leadership.

Good Afternoon Australia, my name is Mike Rotch and this is Daily Boomerang Election predictions live, the most trusted source for election predictions and the most accurate. Last election we accurately predicted the success of 10 seats, many of which went against mainstream predictions such as the fall of Mayo, Melbourne and Hotham. Our incorrect predictions were in the seats of Canberra, Moncreiff, Capricornia, Lingiari, Pearce, however Pearce and Moncreiff proved to be of extreme margins and Capricornia was of inaccurate counting.

Mayo is once again being contested by the former Member MattMonti. Currently held by Former Prime Minister BloodyChrome, he has vacated his seat to launch a fight against another Former Prime Minister in Canberra, but that is for later discussion. As there is no serious challenge made by the Coalition to retain the seat as of yet, it looks to be an **SDP GAIN**.

The seat is an IND V SDP challenge, with a strong campaign by the SDP to take a seat once held by a former Liberal Prime Minister. The seat is currently vacant due to former independent MP BabyYodaVevo running off into the wilderness, however another independent, the Member for Moncreiff Zak, who has moved from Moncreiff to launch a challenge. The Coalition has decided not to contest this seat and many traditionally conservative voters will likely select the lesser or two evils, the centrist option. We expect this seat to be an **INDEPENDENT GAIN/RETAIN** and will mark only the fourth time in Australian history where an independent succeeds another independent in a federal seat.

This seat, currently held by former SDP Prime Minister Youmaton is a close one to watch this election, with both coalition parties targeting the seat. Former Prime Minister Bloody Chrome, and previous National Candidate Elleeit are contesting with both expected to gain a sizeable chunk of the vote. Unexpecting a serious challenge, Youmaton has been forced to take this campaign back on a local level in order to retain her seat and whilst it will be close; the Coalition fielding both active candidates is likely to gain the seat through preferences. At this stage, both have fielded similar campaigns and we expect BloodyChrome to come out on top for a **LIBERAL GAIN** purely from name recognition. However, this is a middle of the campaign prediction and anything could happen.

Prime Minister NGSpy, holding both positions as the Prime Minister and Treasurer has shown to be a strong, decisive leader on the left taking control of the Labor and Socialist party this term and singlehandedly writing a delivering a Federal Budget. Thrust into the position of Prime Minister by chance, the electorate of Pearce have taken a liking to the Prime Minister in similar ways to another radical socialist revolutionary and Prime Minister Bsharri. Combined with a weakened campaign than the prior election, we expect the Prime Minister‚Äôs margin to grow and see the seat as a **SDP RETAIN**

Starting off with a campaign against Showstealer, Copelonian was the original candidate however he packed up and left after day 1, showing how committed the SDP are to their electorates. Showstealer has continuously fought for regional Victoria, taking a stand against policies from both government and opposition for being too extreme either way and will continue to force the House to move towards the middle in order to pass legislation. We expect this to be an **INDEPENDENT RETAIN**

With Nationals MP Superpacman04, the party has decided not to contest out of respect and preservation for when he chooses to come back which he has indicated. Former MP and Prime Minister Dyljam has come back to the seat once again and is pushing a local campaign to bring Tasmanian representation ‚Äúback to the House‚Äù. He is facing a campaign by former parliamentarian BHjr who is applying the same strategy, however is fairly unknown to the reason. Like most seats, it‚Äôs a tight race her but we can clearly see the former member coming out on top for an **INDEPENDENT GAIN**

The Daily Boomerang was the only media organisation to see a Nationals gain here, with Shadow Health Minister GHagrid unseating the previous incumbent Lok. As Shadow Health Minister, GHagrid has consistently shown strong leadership in dealing with the coronavirus crisis which is a weak spot for the government and has proposed numerous alternative policies with the Shadow Treasurer and Leader of the Opposition in a trifecta to combat the crisis. He‚Äôs being challenged by Electrical Union Boss MerrilyPutrid, infamous for her failed political snipes against the Member for Cowper and Shadow Treasurer AussieConservative, who started off strong but has recently dropped of the face of the earth. It‚Äôs likely Melbourne will be a safe seat for the Nationals and will be a **NATIONAL RETAIN**

[04-Apr-20 02:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is a seat to watch as it involves a strong Nationals challenge against controversial member Dr. Jayden Williamson III, PhD. The Leader of the House and potential Prime Ministerial candidate has made controversial moves in his career, pushing a National Anthem plebiscite, crafting the unliked Retrain or Retire program in his plans to combat ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and continuously calls for the waste of taxpayer funds on useless projects. Winston Wilhelmus has consistently proven to be a strong campaigner in previous elections, moving the Nationals vote in electorates from 0% to the higher 40‚Äôs and we‚Äôre likely to see this be a **NATIONAL GAIN**

Now for the seat of **MONCREIFF**


[04-Apr-20 02:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Recently made vacant by independent MP Zak who has moved to Brisbane, the seat of Moncreiff is open to both sides. Perennial candidate My13InchDuck has fought numerous campaigns in the past and like Winston, has brought the Nationals vote share in a seat from 0 to the high 40‚Äôs. He faces a campaign from the recently formed Greens party, led by theOWOTrongle who has recently struggled to keep up with campaigning in such a tight race. Of course this will be close, but we‚Äôre calling this a **NATIONALS GAIN** at this stage.

With former Prime Minister and current Liberal Leader TheAudibleAsh being seemingly absent from debate in recent times and absent from the campaign trail, it is a perfect seat for the SDP to strike into. Fielding a candidate who can espouse the party line of political waffle which contradicts the facts, they can push the impression that ARichTeaBiscuit is a formidable potential member for Capricornia. Of course, if Ash gets his game on the situation will change but until then, **SDP GAIN**

Held by Nationals Founder and Shadow Treasurer AussieConservative, this is one of the safest seats in the country due to a completely absent campaign from any potential challenger. AussieConservative has positioned himself as a down to earth member who connects with the average Australian, often going by the nickname ‚ÄúGriffo‚Äù and has publicised himself as not only a man‚Äôs man, but a family man and a man of economic intelligence. As an alternate Treasurer, many Australians look to him for confidence in the economy and this election has turned to a national campaign espousing his favourite lines of **TAX CUTS!** This seat is easily and by far a **NATIONALS RETAIN**

This seat is like Moncreiff, and open campaign to either the SDP or the Nationals because of the fact that an SDP member is retiring. GenericCardboard and carpetbagger Copelonian, who packed up and left Nicholls in the early hours of the campaign trail, are battling it out to win the seat and it really is the only seat that is too close to call. At this stage, it‚Äôs an **SDP RETAIN** but anything can happen.

Currently held by SDP member Rhaums, they‚Äôve often been lacking in parliament with much of the electorate displeased in the lacking of performance. She started off with a clear path to victory, however this has been blurred with the campaign of Former Senator Stranger195 putting up a fight for the seat. Like Lingiari, it‚Äôs one to watch with anything being able to happen however because of preferences from the Nationals and such a high vote share last election, were predicting a **LIBERAL GAIN**

In conclusion, this election is very tight as all elections are. The Coalition has the advantage of being two parties and allows for voters to choose between moderate and more conservative. The SDP may be in the lead in the popular vote, however like last election this will be placed in the pockets of electorates where the Nationals won a popular vote share in the Senate and lost the house from a number of seats. This election will be an interesting one to watch, because I‚Äôm Mike Rotch delivering the most accurate predictions in the country.

Well, I think that this is a complicated issue, but I think our first step is putting decision making back into the hands of our local communities. The Canberra bubble cannot deal with issues in regional Victoria, out here in West Wimmera, it's just, our government is overblown. We have one MP expected to deal with all the issues from Mildura to Mallacoota, of course some areas are going to be neglected, like West Wimmera has been for too long. This needs to stop. We need to bring back community decision making, because the fact is, if you live in Traralgon, I'm not going to be able to fix your problems, but what I will do is provide the blueprints for you to take your future into your own hands.

I think that there are areas on the Victoria-South Australia border that rely on each other, and as outlined in my manifesto, "Hmmm, make sure that a travel bubble is carved out for towns on the border such as Serviceton, we will. Prevent needlessly prohibitive border rules, I will. Extremely low risk of COVID-19, there is." I've spoken to many West Wimmerans and I think that it's simply reasonable and common-sense for border restrictions to be lifted, and to create a cross-border travel bubble.

And bitch, I hope to sign for the people of West Wimmera, because in this time of crisis, they need million dollar deals. We need to increase grants to West Wimmera Shire in this time of crisis to encourage them to deliver rate relief on their residents, and by giving West Wimmera statehood, tax money won‚Äôt just be going off to Melbourne- it will stay in West Wimmera to develop our local community and build our infrastructure.

[30-Jun-20 07:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, you know, I‚Äôm not stupid. West Wimmeran independence is something we can and should work towards, but we need to do it incrementally. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve proposed a statehood referendum- it‚Äôs more politically realistic and it‚Äôs less all or nothing. It also creates a separate voice for the West Wimmeran people to advocate for us on the road to independence.

What are the candidates thoughts on the issues facing the Murray Darling Basin Scheme, and what plans do you have to get the water flowing?


[30-Jun-20 07:35 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Horror can start.

The Murray Darling Basin Scheme was, to be frank, a shitshow. It was a shitshow because of corporate interests aligned with grubby and greedy politicians with no respect for the people of regional Victoria wrecked our environment for profit. Those responsible for the absolute rorting of the scheme should be punished, and we should give more power to the communities that are impacted and to regulators.


[30-Jun-20 07:47 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Unfortunately we have run out of time, candidates will have a short period to answer this final question.


[30-Jun-20 07:48 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Do the candidates believe that West Wimmera has the capabilities and resources to survive on its own if it became a state?

An independent state or a state of Australia?


[30-Jun-20 07:50 PM] ripauntmay#0083
An Australian state.


[30-Jun-20 07:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
100%, yes, I believe it has the capabilities and resources to function as a state. West Wimmera is a largely homogenous area with synonymous interests, filled with some of the most hard working people in the continent. We see states centred on rural areas in other countries, so it isn‚Äôt as if big cities are necessary for a state‚Äôs survival. I think the West Wimmera State will prosper.

I will work with whoever helps me achieve my goals, however I‚Äôve heard the word on the street, and I think, you know, the people of West Wimmera lean conservative, so I‚Äôll take that into account. I think certainly Horror-HQ is a better choice than the SDP-endorsed incumbent, although you should still vote for me.

I appreciate the gesture from my opponent, and wish to congratulate them as well for having the fortitude to show up to this debate. If you want to send a message to the political establishment this election that you want real change in regional Victoria, that you want community driven governance, that you want the right of your future in your hands and not Canberra‚Äôs, then you should vote 1 EdenhopeStan for Nicholls.


[30-Jun-20 08:12 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Thank you, that wraps up tonight‚Äôs debate, hopefully the people of Nicholls now have a clearer vision in who they are voting for, good luck to the both of you on Saturday!

Across to **PEARCE**, Senator RMSteve has put forth a promising campaign in his challenge against Former Prime Minister and Opposition Leader NGSpy. This race will be tight and could go either way, however we feel as though NGSpy will retain this seat on the slimmest of margins. **SDP RETAIN**

Again a similar story in **MAYO**. However whilst sitting member SnecBoi is the incumbent representing the CLP; preferences from the LNP will not be guaranteed. Whilst the LNP has increased their vote share tremendously, we feel this is not enough to tip the seat. **CLP RETAIN**

Down south into **PENISON** the polls had Former Member Pacman and sitting member Dyljam neck and neck. Whilst Dyljam has attained the endorsements of many parties throughout the country; it is evident that his campaigning was lacking compared to his challenger and we believe Pacman will edge out and win the seat for an **LNP GAIN**

To Victoria, three races can be seen here: **HOTHAM**, **NICHOLLS** and **MELBOURNE**. Melbourne hasn‚Äôt seen a race, so this is a predicted **SDP RETAIN**. Nicholls is an example of the West Wimmerans against the rest of Victoria; especially after Incumbent Showstealer decided to call it quits ‚Äî we believe this will be an **LNP GAIN**. Hotham is a tightly contested 3 way race, however polling indicates Umatbru‚Äôs promises to Heal Australia are healing the hearts of Hotham and we predict this to be an **LNP GAIN** on AusDems Preferences.

Moving to New South Wales, we see the electorates of **ROBERTSON**, **SYDNEY**, **COWPER** AND **CUNNINGHAM**. Robertson is a repeat of last election, where Jayden shows up the Deputy Prime Minister Winston Wilhelmus. With a lacklustre public performance during this term, Jayden is likely to have lost public support with a **LNP RETAIN**. Sydney will be an **INDEPENDENT GAIN** with **CUNNINGHAM** being and **LNP RETAIN**.

Finally the seat of **COWPER**. With a strong campaign and show from both major candidates, this seat is likely to come down to preferences. The endorsements from minor parties have little weight, but must be considered and will see Griffo narrowly ahead; with Merrily as a result of shocking campaign tactics diminishing her own campaign and Count Binface, who has gained traction, allowing Griffo to ride to a narrow victory on his preferences. Cowper will narrowly be a **LNP RETAIN**

Nice to see you again, Lachlan.


[13-Aug-20 08:01 PM] inactive#6974
I see that the sample of this is 9 parliamentarians, do we have a party split on this?


[13-Aug-20 08:02 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I think that's the best explanation.


[13-Aug-20 08:02 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The sample has been evenly weighed


[13-Aug-20 08:03 PM] inactive#6974
Uh, can we still have a breakdown from each party and their respondents?


[13-Aug-20 08:05 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We have a parliamentary breakdown
3 Government
1 Opposition
5 Crossbench


[13-Aug-20 08:05 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I can reveal my vote for the people. I voted against the PM but because I don't think the PM's response so far during this term have had his priorities straight. So far, we've seen more legislation n climate related issues which I support but right now isn't the time for debate on water bills but on helping the people. I think the Speaker needs to understand this too. His job of selecting the bills to debate is crucial and he needs to choose accordingly and if he fails to do so, the PM needs to get involved.


[13-Aug-20 08:07 PM] inactive#6974
Interesting.


[13-Aug-20 08:07 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Thank you, i applaud you for being transparent


[13-Aug-20 08:07 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I support the PM at the moment and will give him my confidence in a vote if it came to that as things currently stand, but the he needs to act. If not, I fear my sentiment will be felt by many others on the cross bench.


[13-Aug-20 08:08 PM] inactive#6974
In what areas do you want a response from this government? Regarding economic response to COVID-19, or offering ADF personnel, or did you have something else in mind? @My13InchDuck


[13-Aug-20 08:08 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
However of course, the question facing the House today is the state of the LNP I believe. I'm not sure how the party is going at the moment. I fear not well.


[13-Aug-20 08:10 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The LNP seems to be in a state of despair


[13-Aug-20 08:11 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I'll address the ADF point you bring up. I think the Prime Minister has to take his role seriously and make it be felt across the country. We've seen issues with private security in many states but Victoria the clearest. We have the ADF at our disposal and they simply must be used. The ADF are, or at least I'd like to think, not privy to the same issues which affect the members of the general public guarding others. The ADF needs to be brought in to make sure those under quarantine are kept under it. The PM has the ability to do this and the states must fall in line according. If the Prime Minister does this I think it will do a great deal of good and the people will reward him for it.


[13-Aug-20 08:11 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
And I agree with the point regarding the LNP, they've seen better days for sure.


[13-Aug-20 08:13 PM] ripauntmay#0083
It is clear that Chairman Dan is more at fault here than anyone. However, I think that this government should shoulder some of that blame, considering its lack of effort in recent times.


[13-Aug-20 08:14 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
At the end of the day, no matter how well Dan does, it will still reflect on the PM. For the PM's own sake, he should make these issues go away before we see this second wave turn into a tidal wave.


[13-Aug-20 08:15 PM] ripauntmay#0083
My belief is that the elimination strategy is not working


[13-Aug-20 08:16 PM] inactive#6974
So you are advocating for herd immunity?


[13-Aug-20 08:16 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I support a herd immunity type strategy but we're clearly too far gone to achieve that now. We've invested too much and the sunk cost fallacy will keep us in our ways. What we have to do now is support small business and workers to make sure our economy is as strong as it possibly can be when we return to daily life.


[13-Aug-20 08:16 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Yes


[13-Aug-20 08:18 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We need to reopen the economy, we cannot continue down the path of reopening and closing


[13-Aug-20 08:18 PM] inactive#6974
This will cause deaths.


[13-Aug-20 08:18 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Here's the effect of the Swedish policy. That beats NZ's current state of affairs. This of course doesn't mean that we lick every door knob in sight or walk the elderly to the leper colonies but it means we are smart about this.

[13-Aug-20 08:18 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The elimination strategy is fine in the circumstance that we are close to a vaccine but we are far from close


[13-Aug-20 08:19 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Cars cause over 100k deaths a year, we wouldn't outlaw cars.


[13-Aug-20 08:19 PM] ripauntmay#0083
What happens if we do not find a vaccine


[13-Aug-20 08:19 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We cannot continue down this path


[13-Aug-20 08:19 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Not in Australia, globally that is.


[13-Aug-20 08:19 PM] ripauntmay#0083
It‚Äôs senseless, it‚Äôs reckless, open the country, open the economy, get Australians back to work


[13-Aug-20 08:20 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Moreover, the vaccine's effectiveness matters. If it's <90% and everyone takes it, we'll still struggle to get herd immunity and that's if everyone takes it which they wont. The smart policy is to take the Swedish approach and do it wisely.


[13-Aug-20 08:20 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We should have taken that approach from day one


[13-Aug-20 08:21 PM] inactive#6974
It's funny how you went from the Government isn't doing enough, to the government shouldn't be doing anything?


[13-Aug-20 08:23 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Government action isn't limited to one area of policy. Government should be doing more in regards to our situation with the use of ADF for example and helping small business and workers. But government can do that too while we go with the Swedish model. These things aren't conflicting nor are we perusing the Swedish model


[13-Aug-20 08:23 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I think you've mixed up what we're arguing for in principle and what ought to happen in practise.


[13-Aug-20 08:23 PM] inactive#6974
I suggest you read this study here,
*hands this out*
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20148429v1.full.pdf
This suggests our immunity to SARS-CoV-2 does not last very long at all ‚Äî as little as two months for some people. Herd immunity might not be viable at all, and it will just be wave after wave.


[13-Aug-20 08:23 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I argued against doing the herd imminuty style response just before. But it doesn't make it wrong


[13-Aug-20 08:24 PM] inactive#6974
That being said, a vaccine needs to also prove it's self to be strong enough to last.


[13-Aug-20 08:24 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Speaking of vaccines, how good is Russia


[13-Aug-20 08:24 PM] inactive#6974
This is because if immunity is short-lived, we will be in an ongoing cycle of endless reinfection. For herd immunity to be effective we need a high percentage (perhaps more than 60%) of people to be immune at any one time to disrupt chains of transmission. This can‚Äôt happen if a lot of reinfection is occurring.


[13-Aug-20 08:24 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
> immunity to SARS-CoV-2 does not last very long at all
So why are we locking people up infinitely? We're seeing a second wave already and it's looking like a tidal wave compared to the first. You can't argue that the effects of one straegy are poor and then not apply it to your style too.


[13-Aug-20 08:25 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I agree


[13-Aug-20 08:25 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
> This is because if immunity is short-lived, we will be in an ongoing cycle of endless reinfection.
Like the ... flu?


[13-Aug-20 08:25 PM] inactive#6974
I bring you back to the comments before "That being said, a vaccine needs to also prove it's self to be strong enough to last."


[13-Aug-20 08:25 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Right, but we don't even know if we can achieve that to start with.


[13-Aug-20 08:26 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This second wave of outbreaks has been deadlier, and it has hit harder, the elimination strategy has failed

What are your thoughts on the Russian coronavirus vaccine?


[13-Aug-20 08:27 PM] inactive#6974
It is only at stage 1 of testing, correct?


[13-Aug-20 08:27 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I‚Äôve heard that Putin has already tested it on one of his daughters


[13-Aug-20 08:27 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I don't know enough about it but Germany has said the vaccine is not ready yet. It hasn't gone through all 3 stages of its trial yet.


[13-Aug-20 08:28 PM] ripauntmay#0083
It‚Äôs been reported that the vaccine will be rolled out to the masses next month


[13-Aug-20 08:28 PM] inactive#6974
Russia skipped most of the testing phases that come before licensing. We actually have no idea if it is safe and effective at all.


[13-Aug-20 08:28 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I'll wait till we have more info on the issue before I have a public opinion on it.


[13-Aug-20 08:29 PM] inactive#6974
It's very unknown, and I wouldn't endorse it yet


[13-Aug-20 08:30 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Agreed.


[13-Aug-20 08:30 PM] inactive#6974
Maybe the Russian vaccine is indeed effective. But maybe it only produces an immune response for two weeks, and the hundreds of millions of planned doses do nothing at all to prevent the pandemic. We simply don‚Äôt know.


[13-Aug-20 08:31 PM] inactive#6974
Anyway, @ripauntmay did you have more results of this parliamentarian survey?


[13-Aug-20 08:32 PM] ripauntmay#0083

Breaking news, climate change is real.


[14-Aug-20 04:34 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Droughts reduce the viability of regional towns, and cause spikes in the rate of rural male suicides, by as much as 15% (Hanigan et al. 2012). Severe droughts are expected to become more frequent, especially across southern Australia (CSIRO and BoM 2015).


[14-Aug-20 04:34 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
This drought reduced agricultural income by 42% and employment by 70,000 people (a 15% reduction) (Commonwealth of Australia 2005); other droughts in the past 30 years have reduced jobs by 6,000 and farm incomes by 18% (Wittwer and Griffith 2011; Commonwealth of Australia 2005)


[14-Aug-20 04:34 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Climate change will cause significant economic loss to agricultural heartlands such as the Murray-Darling Basin and the Western Australian wheat belt.


[14-Aug-20 04:34 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Climate Change is a hoax, get off my show


[14-Aug-20 04:34 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
The 2009 Melbourne heatwave reduced apple and pear crops by 30-70% due to sunburn (Thomson et al. 2014). Based
on the losses experienced in the 2009 heatwave event, the annual expected
losses to agriculture from heatwaves is $39.3 million, rising to $109.5 million if greenhouse gas emissions continue at high levels (Natural Capital Economics 2018).


[14-Aug-20 04:34 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
The 2011 and 2015 cyclones destroyed 70-90% of the Queensland banana crop, and the recent floods in north Queensland killed an estimated 664,000 cattle,
worth an estimated $800 million (ABC 2019). Floodwaters can disrupt transport routes, interrupting supply chains and compromising food security, as happened in the 2011 Queensland floods when Rockhampton (population of 75,000) was cut off by road, rail and air for two weeks. Brisbane came within a day of running out of bread during the floods (DAFF 2012).


[14-Aug-20 04:35 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Repeated extreme weather events can reduce agricultural productivity by reducing investments in new technologies and production efficiencies, leading to a permanent loss in productivity improvements that might otherwise help
to counteract the effects of climate change. The 2000s drought was estimated to have reduced agricultural productivity by 18% through this effect (Sheng et al. 2019).


[14-Aug-20 04:35 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Get off my show you lefty


[14-Aug-20 04:35 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Droughts in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s each shaved about 1% off national GDP growth in the years they occurred (compared to the global financial crisis in 2008-9 reducing GDP by 2%) (Commonwealth of Australia 2005; RBA 2006; World Bank 2015). Rural exports declined by 23% ($2 billion) during the 2002-3 drought, whilst overall food prices rose by 4.4%, twice the rate of the Consumer Price Index (Quiggin 2007). The current drought has already reduced farm output
by 6% and total GDP by about 0.25% (Debelle 2019). Even if rainfall returns to normal soon, the impact of the drought will continue
to exert a drag on the economy for some time. Federal drought assistance since 2000 has totaled around $6 billion, preventing these funds being invested in productive purposes such as research and development, innovation or infrastructure. Estimates
of future drought frequency and impacts suggest an effective lowering of GDP by 1% every year (Carroll et al. 2007).

Welcome, welcome.


[06-Oct-20 05:03 PM] RMSteve#7137
Here is the format for the debate


[06-Oct-20 05:03 PM] RMSteve#7137
I have a list of questions that have not been disclosed to anyone prior to the debate.


[06-Oct-20 05:04 PM] RMSteve#7137
Each candidate will be asked a question and will have 3 minutes to respond to the question.


[06-Oct-20 05:04 PM] RMSteve#7137
Then each candidate will be allowed to give a rebuttal of 3 minutes at the end of both candidates' answers


[06-Oct-20 05:05 PM] RMSteve#7137
Finally, each candidate will have 10 minutes to give a closing statement.


[06-Oct-20 05:05 PM] RMSteve#7137
Candidates, do you accept these rules?

Thank you, Abe, well firstly I have the political experience and influence to truly create change within this electorate. The people of Moncrieff elected me at the by-election a couple of weeks ago because they supported my plan for this electorate, and again, I put out the same plan and agenda for Moncrieff, an agenda of jobs and economic recovery. Moncrieff needs stability; this electorate needs a member who serves the entire term, I am that member, I can reassure you that the CLP candidate is not that member, especially looking at their party‚Äôs track record. I have attended parliament every single day since elected and I will do the same if re-elected.

Thank you, Abe. I do firmly believe that I am the best choice to be elected to serve as the member for Moncrieff for the following reasons. I am a local and I know the area, I know what the concerns are of locals in the area, compare this to my opponent is a notorious carpetbagger who has walked away from Sydney and Capricornia in elections just because the going got tough. Secondly, I will be a strong voice for ALL Australians, regardless if they live in the bush, the 'burbs, or the city. Thirdly is we now have an MP running around promising all this fanfare of infrastructure saying they are desperately needed, then where has he been advocating to get them done prior to the election?

Thank you, Mr. Rook. Mr. Riley, you have 5 minutes to respond.

Well firstly, I am born and bred in this electorate, I‚Äôve lived in the scenic rim and Gold Coast, I am a local, and I‚Äôve come back to fight for this electorate. I contested Moncrieff in the by-election because it was a perfect opportunity for me to again serve the Australian people, serve the people of my true home. If the CLP candidate was as committed to this electorate as he says he is, he would have contested the by-election that again happened just a few weeks ago. My priorities are with Moncrieff and the people of Moncrieff, and I will serve them.

Well in rebuttal I would say that if this is the case, where can he be seen fighting for our local farmers? Our local youngsters? Our local Parents? Our local Infrastructure? Truth of the matter is all though he may of been born here, this ain't his home. His home is in Sydney. Not only this, Riley claims to be a local everywhere he campaigns, Sydney, Capricornia, and now here so he either has 3 clones for each are who is a cut and paste lying politician. I on the other hand have worked hard my entire life growing up in a working class family in Kilcoy. In response to what you said about my apparent "lack of commitment" everyone who knows me in Karana Downs, Kilcoy, Lowood, and so many other areas know I am vocal community activity and always fights for what is right.

Mr. Riley, this next question is for you.


[06-Oct-20 05:26 PM] RMSteve#7137
What your opponent says about you moving electorates is true, and is on the mind of many in Moncrieff this election. What do you have to say about these accusations?

I would like to make a quick point in reply to that rebuttal, look at my parliamentary record, a record of delivering for farmers, during my short parliamentary term i delivered a motion in recognition of the hard work farmers do, you cannot even bother turning up to parliament to debate. Now in response to the question, 
I lived in Sydney, yes that is true, i served Sydney in the federal parliament. But I have decided to come back to Queensland making the decision to contest the neighbouring electorate of Capricornia at the last election. Moncrieff is my home and I am not going anywhere. I can‚Äôt say the same about the Country Labor member, or even members of his country Labor party. It would be hypocritical to attack me for making decisions about my future when Members of the Country Labor Party have done the same thing. If it was on the mind of the electors of Moncrieff I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here as the federal Member for Moncrieff would I.


[06-Oct-20 05:32 PM] RMSteve#7137

OK well first off I can't turn up to parliament if I'm not an MP so I suggest you take a closer look at your work place, which is a reminder is the Parliament. Aye I agree you have a record of fighting for farmers through a single motion in Parliament. Riley can stand there with a puffed out chest proclaiming how he's fighting for farmers because all he gave is a pat on the back in Parliament just before the election because him and his party is desperate as they lose touch with farming communities. If Riley really cared about farmers, he'd go down and speak to them and hear what they want to say. Farmers have come forth to beg us for funding for rural healthcare services, we achieved that threefold. Farmers have come forth asking for assistance in paying for fertilizer, we achieved that. They ask us to clean up our rivers and streams and the Murray-Darlin Basin and we achieved all of that. Do you know what Riley and the Liberals did to respond to that? They tried to vote all of those things down. They don't care about farmers until it advantages them and even then can't even bring forth enough of an effort beyond a single motion. Lets also not forget that Riley and the Liberals continue to claim over and over again throughout this country that they'll fight for the quiet Australian. Quite simply, Riley is completely out of touch with those people as he remains one of the most vocal career politicians in the business. Riley is vocal about how he thinks that working people of Australia should be discriminated against based on religion and ethnicity. He's vocal about opposing the types of environmental regulations which farmers beg and fight for. He's vocal about everything except how much of a fraud he is. Like I said earlier, he ever has 3 clones of himself running around Sydney, Capricornia and Moncrieff, or he is a cut and paste lying politician is only offering the same old politics of despair and cynicism

Well firstly, you can go to parliament and debate on legislation, to make such claim that you can‚Äôt is ridiculous and incorrect. I find it utterly disgraceful that this candidate doesn‚Äôt know his party‚Äôs track record in government, a party that is supposedly focused on fighting for regional and rural Australia. His party has done nothing for farmers other than to bog them down with further green tape, his party in coalition with the Social Democratic Party has destroyed Australian farmers, his party in coalition with Social Democrats saw taxes on farmers rise, yet we get the same old rhetoric from this failed Labor Party that only cares about its self interests. I am very much in touch with the people of Moncrieff, and I am voice for them, I can‚Äôt say the same about the Country Labor Party. We see the same old rhetoric from the left, flush this mob, flush this government.

Does the candidate pledge to support all workers in Moncrieff compared to his opponent who has a track record of discrimination against Chinese and Islamic workers, with him formerly leading a party which called for the ban of all Chinese and Islamic Immigration

To my opponent I say that I live in Karana Downs and have an actual job unlike Riley. I'm not gonna be able to take first class flights down to Canberra like he can to go debate bills when I can instead continue to work here, support my family and advocate for these bills up here where the people actually listen and the people actually are. I'm not gonna be trapped in the Canberra bubble like you. Anyway moving on to the relevant question, Yes I do. I say this because regardless of you background, regardless of whom you love, regardless of anything. If you put in the effort, and you take the fair go and have a fair go, you get protected. However, to do this we need to make sure all workers get the same rights and protections as everyone else in this great country of ours. Now sadly I don't think we can expect my opponent to do the honourable thing and stand up for these people in parliament, but also in general because of his own political background being that he belonged to explicitly racist and xenophobic party, not only that, he was also LEADER of the damn thing.

Again we see the same old rhetoric from the left, we see the CLP candidate make assumptions on my background despite knowing nothing about me, nothing about what I used to do. I would like to inform him that I was a small business owner, I worked hard for what I have. I would like to further add that my taxpayer salary is donated to charity, because it‚Äôs not about money like the CLP candidate suggests, it‚Äôs about serving the people and that is what I will continue to do in the next parliament. The CLP candidate again has many opportunities to respond to legislation, he could write a blog in his free time yet he hasn‚Äôt because he is only interested in adding an extra number to the CLP in the House of Representatives. The people of Moncrieff will reject him and his bid for election in this electorate. As a potential Minister in the next parliament i will be able to deliver for this electorate like never before.

You were a small business owner before you got into politics but you've been in politics so long that you've lost touch. You've been paid Prime Ministerial, Ministerial and Member salaries for so long alongside expenses that it is almost nauseating. Furthermore, he can't even hear my words. I've advocated for bills in my local community and don't need to hide behind a computer to let my views be heard. I go straight to the people of my community and pitch to them how we can make life change for the better through the Country Labor Party. I don't have time do work, AND go down to Canberra on a regular basis to debate and write bills.

My question is for both candidates. What is their opinion on local politics and do they think that it slowly dismantled in favour of state and federal government control?

Mr. Riley, you have seven minutes to respond.

I think you clearly have selective hearing, i stated that my salary is donated to charity, my salary during my term as a parliamentarian and during my term as a Minister and Prime Minister.

[06-Oct-20 06:03 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I think the three levels of government are fundamental for a pristine Australia, however the powers of these governments could have some amendments in relation to power and power distribution.

In terms of that question local government plays an important in the layers and must be respected and protected. There will always be room for reform to make it more efficient don't get me wrong and I will always advocate such policies. Local government helps take the pressure of state and federal governments which allows them to focus on other areas which we must always consider.

[06-Oct-20 06:05 PM] RMSteve#7137
Before closing statements


[06-Oct-20 06:06 PM] RMSteve#7137
We all know the coronavirus pandemic has been ravaging the country and the world, and Queensland is no different. Indeed, there is a current border shutdown in place, which has been heavily criticised. If elected, how will you help the government of the day, whoever it is, defeat coronavirus and what is each of your opinion on the border closure?


[06-Oct-20 06:06 PM] RMSteve#7137
Mr. Rook, you have seven minutes.


[06-Oct-20 06:09 PM] RookWilt#6643
I believe that for this terribly sad disease, we must listen to the science, there is absolutely no room to move on this, however we should still take into account humanity when we can. But sadly we can't always do that, even when we want to must and is sadly just a fact of life. I will help the government by advocating scientifically proven and backed policies to help not only flatten the curve but return to a new better normal way of life post COVID which is going to be one the key struggles. I will also help communicate these science backed policies to the public to make sure they are crystal clear, to beat this thing, we all gotta put aside our difference and pull together as a team

Thank you. Mr. Riley, you have seven minutes.


[06-Oct-20 06:15 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Thank you, Abe, the coronavirus pandemic has destroyed families, it has destroyed businesses and the economy. The current border restrictions that are in place show that the state government has no compassion, Moncrieff is a border electorate and people of Moncrieff want an MP who has compassion, I have the compassion to fight for border residents, those Queenslanders who can‚Äôt come home due to lack of compassion. There is no medical reasoning behind the border shutdown, NSW has not had community transmission of coronavirus for 11 days, and Northern NSW hasn‚Äôt seen coronavirus for months. These borders restrictions are unnecessary, and if they continue to stay in place we will continue to see our tourism industry decimated, we will continue to see job loss, and lastly, we will continue to see businesses shutdown, particularly those small businesses that heavily rely on tourism and the tourism industry. We need a member who stands up to the state government, a member who holds the government accountable for their actions; we will not see that with the CLP.

Moncrieff will always be unique in regards to COVID due to its geographically location. I will always fight for what is right in terms of science and if I can regardless of the politics. Now sadly I can't say the same about my opponent who despite this being a national pandemic, he still doesn't have the good faith and willpower to put politics behind him for one moment. As your MP, I will fight day in day out for what is both scientifically backed and at the same time, trying to keep it as fair as humanity possible, however I won't promise the world because at the end of the day, what is and isn't science isn't in my control.

In summing the campaign I'm running to be elected MP of my home seat of Moncrieff. It is one of hope, one of new ideas and new leadership for the people here in Moncireff. To finally give them a voice by the people for the people who cares about everyone, not just a select few. If elected as your MP I will fight day in and day out for our local communities from Eumundi, to the border, from places as far west as Toowoomba to Bribie Island. The things I will fight for and do as MP are;
- More funding for our local public services, especially the bush which has been neglected
- Be a tough voice that stands up for our area
- Implement a Provincial Agriculture Scheme to grow investment in
agriculture
- Have a Primary Industry Council made of representatives from Agriculture
Australia
- Foster more talent in the Agricultural industry
- Oppose intervention by the government into supply chain management
- Create ‚ÄúAgricultural Estates‚Äù which will be blocks of subsidised housing with
the aim to help resettle families get into work in the regional job market
Introduce a new tax regime which will benefit farmers through taxing
unearned incomes over hard work.

Riley has shown himself unworthy to represent you in the national parliament, shown himself to be a brazen liar telling numerous falsehoods to save his own skin. He has no plan for regional Moncrieff and only cares about the issues when it affects the affluent areas of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast whom bankroll his party. 

This time, vote 1 RookWilt (Afraid_Range) of the Country Labor Party in Moncrieff for real change in our back yard.

Thank you, to close I would like to remind the people of Moncrieff about how important this choice is, the choice between an experienced candidate that has continuously fought for you in the federal parliament, the choice between a candidate that is promising lower taxes and economic recovery. I am the people‚Äôs candidate; I am the candidate with skills and knowledge to build back this electorate better, the Liberal Party is promising jobs and economic growth this election, record infrastructure building projects. I am promising the delivering of vital services, the construction of the second M1, the expansion and upgrades to roads, highways and motorways throughout the electorate, the cutting of red and green tape which is negatively affecting the economy. I am promising relief for our farmers and farming communities, support for the regions and agriculture. Only I am the candidate offering solutions to the problems facing Moncrieff, let me continue with my plan for recovery in this electorate, let me continue with my plan, which benefits everyone within this electorate. The choice this election is clear, don‚Äôt vote for the fake Country Party, vote for the Liberals, vote 1 Riley8583 in Moncrieff, let‚Äôs build back better. Thank You!

The seat of Brisbane will be a must watch seat this election


[07-Oct-20 08:51 PM] RMSteve#7137
Indeed. It was a close one last time


[07-Oct-20 08:52 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The two main candidates at the by-election again go head to head


[07-Oct-20 08:53 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We are expecting this seat to be very close again


[07-Oct-20 08:53 PM] ripauntmay#0083
At this stage we can put it in the too close to call category


[07-Oct-20 08:54 PM] ripauntmay#0083
If the Liberals want to form the next government, they will need to hold this seat


[07-Oct-20 08:56 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Now onto the seat of Canberra


[07-Oct-20 08:57 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This seat was represented by Former Prime Minister Youmaton, who has retired from parliament.

We have seen a strong campaign from the Liberals and a weak campaign from the Social Democrats so far


[07-Oct-20 08:59 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Will this seat once again fall to the right


[07-Oct-20 08:59 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We are predicting that this seat will be a Liberal gain


[07-Oct-20 08:59 PM] ripauntmay#0083

[07-Oct-20 09:04 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The seat of Capricornia is a vast electorate


[07-Oct-20 09:05 PM] ripauntmay#0083
It ranges from the south of Queensland to the north


[07-Oct-20 09:05 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We have seen a relatively similar campaign from both candidates


[07-Oct-20 09:06 PM] ripauntmay#0083
At this stage we are predicting that this seat will be retained by the SDP


[07-Oct-20 09:08 PM] ripauntmay#0083

This seat was held by the Liberal National Party quite comfortably prior to it being held by the SDP


[07-Oct-20 09:10 PM] ripauntmay#0083
At this stage, we can predict that the Deputy Prime Minister will make it into the next parliament


[07-Oct-20 09:11 PM] ripauntmay#0083

Cunningham is a seat that has voted for the Liberal Party for quite some time and we are not expecting any different this election


[07-Oct-20 09:12 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We are predicting that Cunningham will be a Liberal Retain


[07-Oct-20 09:13 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This is due to a weak campaign from opposing candidates


[07-Oct-20 09:14 PM] ripauntmay#0083

[04-Dec-20 12:31 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We have Breaking News from Canberra, the Prime Minister has tested positive for COVID-19.


[04-Dec-20 12:32 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This comes days after returning from the Afghanistan trip and breaching quarantine.


[04-Dec-20 12:34 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The contraction of the virus puts at risk staffers, parliamentarians, members of the press, and the general staff at Parliament House.


[04-Dec-20 12:36 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This utter and sheer incompetence will be downfall of this Prime Minister, the fact that the Prime Minister thought that it would be fine if he breached quarantine is disgusting. This Prime Minister deserves no wishes, he deserves absolutely nothing but relentless attacks against what he has done.


[04-Dec-20 12:39 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This Prime Minister seems to think that there is a rule for the high and mighty and a seperate rule for the everyday Australian. For those Australians who have had to suffer at their expense whilst quarantining in an airtight hotel. For those Australians who are not even given the opportunity to quarantine in their own home.


[04-Dec-20 12:43 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This Prime Minister has failed, and this failure does not deserve endorsement. This Prime Minister deserves to be voted out, his action have led to the potential spread of this virus throughout the community. This Prime Minister has put at risk the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.


[04-Dec-20 12:45 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We need to hold this Prime Minister accountable for his actions, and that is what my show does.


[04-Dec-20 12:49 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We need to stand up and support common sense, support accountability, and support a team that does not usher in double standards. The Prime Minister is currently living the high life whilst quarantining at the lodge, a multi-million dollar mansion. Whilst the everyday Australian suffers, we need to show this Prime Minister what life is like outside of his Canberra bubble. He needs to see the hurt that everyday Australians are feeling,  the pain of those families who have had to suffer.

Now, we will go to a short ad break

We are back, but not on the topic of what chaos the Prime Minister has caused


[04-Dec-20 12:53 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We now move to the topic of relations with China


[04-Dec-20 12:56 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This federal government has done the bare minimum in holding China accountable for their actions, this government has failed to stand up for Australian wine producers, it has failed to stand up for Australian sovereignty. This government has failed to call out the communist regime, it has failed to call out the mass crimes the CCP has committed. This government has failed to stand up for our Troops, it has failed on all fronts, and that my friends is utterly shameful.

So hypothetically speaking, you could say that this is an opportunity to box up 2020 as a year and punch (as in box) it right out of history.


[26-Dec-20 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, as a tradition in AusSim History ‚Äî every year an awards ceremony is held. Traditionally it is run by tbyrn, however due to time cutting it close, I believe he may have forgotten and is a busy big boy now.

But why do we have dummy spits and political upsets in AustraliaSim?


[31-Dec-20 04:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because we have elections to elect politicians

Throughout this year, many politicians were elected, appointed and defeated

This first election was easily won by the SDP, but **despite a tremendous win by the SDP, then leader MattMonti failed to be elected with the rest of the parliamentary team**.

This led to NGSpy becoming Prime Minister, and succesfully leading a full term in government before being defeated by Riley and the Liberal-National Coalition.

Of course, when you have a government consisting of Riley, Griffo, Winston, Duck, BC and PC, let's just say things get a bit "naughty"

Overseeing the National Anthem Plebiscite of the Previous Term, the government took a pro-Advance Australia Fair Approach.


[31-Dec-20 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Griffo, being the chair of the Keep It As It Is Campaign was furious at the narrow loss and travelled through loopholes to prevent I Am Australian becoming Australia's National Anthem through a variety of means: 'misrepresenting' the plebiscite results as a win for AAF, refusing to follow the plebiscite due to low turnout and not being enforceable, creating a mish-mash rendition of Advance Australia Fair and I am Australian, and appointing a somewhat bureaucratic 'Transitional Anthem Council' to stall the change.


[31-Dec-20 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Obviously, the public did not like it and this event is henceforth known as **Australia's National Anthem Debacle**


[31-Dec-20 05:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
By the July 2020 Election, Griffo had been promoted from Treasurer to Prime Minister in a peaceful party transition. However this bid for re-election, despite achieving the third largest popular vote in Australian history was not successful. **The Prime Minister, Former Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Former Deputy Prime Minister all lost their bid for re-election**

53% of AusSimmers did not vote for a change. 53% of 74% of AustraliaSim did, meaning that as a whole: only 40% of AustraliaSim actually voted for ‚ÄòI Am Australian‚Äô when you do the maths compared with the rest going to ‚ÄòGriffo‚Äô by default.

[04-May-21 06:49 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Welcome to everyone tuning in tonight, we have had to push today‚Äôs show up to 7:20 for reasons outside of our control‚Ä¶. Sorry for the inconvenience!


[04-May-21 06:50 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Tonight I will break down what has happened recently, from the election to the process of forming the next government.


[04-May-21 06:53 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Australians went to the polls on Saturday with what was expected to be an average night for the right in the lower house, but what happened was not expected. We saw a bloodbath with the National Party being eradicated from the House of Representatives, and the Liberals reduced to 1 seat.


[04-May-21 06:57 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We saw the left in Australia triumph with significant double digit swings and margins. What was supposed to be a good night for the Australian Democrats turned into a night of tears and chaos, as Caesar‚Äôs career as Leader of the Party came to an abrupt end. This once successful future hopeful freshman turned Leader of the Opposition had an ambition for the top job, but his ambition fell short when he decided to contest unstable ground.


[04-May-21 07:00 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We saw gains from the SDP and GLP, with both parties now having enough seats to form a comfortable majority government.


[04-May-21 07:04 PM] ripauntmay#0083
We look across to the results of a chamber that will play an important role for any future government, a chamber that could now possibly be plagued with deadlocks and sign the death of multiple bills. 

This chamber saw a significant uplift in support for the National Party with them winning 2/4 seats up for election, however, there was hope that the Nationals would win 3/4 seats, and be able to control the chamber in its own right.


[04-May-21 07:06 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The next Prime Minister has a challenge on their hands, they will have to deal with a senate that leans right meaning that much of the legislation introduced would need to be moderate of nature, if there was any hope of passing it.


[04-May-21 07:10 PM] ripauntmay#0083
At least we can take hope in Griffonomics protecting this nation from a radical agenda such as the Green New Deal and other borderline socialist policies.


[04-May-21 07:11 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Now, I will briefly discuss the process of forming the next government.


[04-May-21 07:15 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The President will discuss if it has not already and invite the leader of the largest party to form government. Then the necessary requirements for that formation must be met, which are that the government has the confidence of the house. So, essentially, the next government will need to have the support of at least 8 MP‚Äôs in order to form. At this stage, we are predicting that an SDP-GLP Coalition is likely, due to its ideological compatibility.


[04-May-21 07:18 PM] ripauntmay#0083
That is all from me tonight, goodnight Australia!

The latest polling has been mostly positive for the government, with the Australian Democrats and Social Democratic Party polling at a combined total of 45%. However, it is not all sunshine and rainbows, with the Australian Democrats having overtaken the largest party of the government, meaning that they would be the senior partner in the next government if an election was held today...

The Nationals have a long road ahead of them, if they want to be successful at the next election, they need to step up their game and offer a voice for those Australians who feel let down by all sides of politics, they need to extend their appeal to the centre and centre right voters, that are looking for an alternative to the Liberals and Australian Democrats.

We saw a recent National Party bill that advocated for the rights of Australians, voted down in the senate, by the parties of the Left and Centre. This bill sought to prevent the use of vaccine passports for COVID-19, and protect the rights and liberties of Australians. To those libertarians, and rights activists, do not give your vote to the parties that are openly willing to take away your rights at any given moment. Australians need to take a stand, we need to take back our freedoms and rights. This show proudly supports the civil and political rights of all Australians, and we will continue to fight and be the voice of those Australians, that are sick and tired of the state, crippling our rights, at every chance they get.

Today, Queensland was struck by a major blackout, after a reported explosion at a Callide power plant. This blackout has led calls for the creation of new coal fired power plants, to help keep the lights on.

{Reactions}
sus (3) 

[25-May-21 07:43 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Coal is powering this nation, and i wholeheartedly back these calls, we need more coal fired power plants, and we also need to look into the adoption of Nuclear power plants. There has been growing support in the community for Nuclear Power plants, and there is no logical reasoning suggesting why we should not consider this avenue. Coal in conjunction with Nuclear Energy, will keep our energy grid powering, for decades to come. Renewable energy will not be able to provide base-load power, as demonstrated today, with its failure to keep on any of the lights throughout Queensland, despite it making up an estimated 20% of energy produced. Renewable energy is not the future, despite what members of this government want you to think.

Welcome to Alan Jones Live


[08-Jun-21 07:27 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Tonight we will dissect the recent opinion polling, and what it means for Australia.


[08-Jun-21 07:32 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Support for the government has started to decline, with the governing parties projected to lose 2 seats. The loss of these seats would put the government in jeopardy, with it needing to seek support from parties and independents on the crossbench.


[08-Jun-21 07:39 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The Opposition has increased its vote share; however, the Opposition is also projected to lose two seats, potentially opening the door for a National-Liberal lead opposition in the next parliament.


[08-Jun-21 07:44 PM] ripauntmay#0083
It looks like the National Party is on track for recovery after the loss of Griffonomics. However, they must not be complacent, as there is every chance that this current incline could turn into a decline.


[08-Jun-21 07:45 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Only time will tell.


[08-Jun-21 07:46 PM] ripauntmay#0083
In other news, polling for the state of Queensland was released, with the National Party sitting at a surprisingly high vote share, just behind the governing Social Democratic Party.


[08-Jun-21 07:48 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The recent opinion polling shows that Australians are again considering the right of centre as their choice. However, the left is still holding solid, despite the slight increase for the right.


[08-Jun-21 07:50 PM] ripauntmay#0083
That is all I have for tonight.

[23-Jun-21 05:35 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Welcome to tonights program


[23-Jun-21 05:37 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The Government is without a Deputy Prime Minister after the resignation of Ghagrid which sent shockwaves throughout Australia.


[23-Jun-21 05:39 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The resignation of Ghagrid as Leader has caused the Australian Democrats to scramble for a new leader, with the Member for Robertson rumoured to take the helm.


[23-Jun-21 05:40 PM] ripauntmay#0083
With the resignation of Ghagrid, comes a by-election, which means that the government is no longer governing in Majority.


[23-Jun-21 05:42 PM] ripauntmay#0083
This means that the government will need to rely on the CLP, or Tybrn to pass legislation. Our analysis shows that the Member for Moncrieff will likely side with the government on most policy, however, the government should still be worried.


[23-Jun-21 05:44 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The Denison by-election is a must win for the government, if it wants to hang onto the majority it had prior to the by-election. The odds are unfortunately not in the government's favour, with government's generally losing by-elections. This means that the government may need to do deals with crossbench MP's to pass their legislative agenda, and what is presumed to be the next budget.


[23-Jun-21 05:47 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The resignation of Ghagrid has likely put holes in the government's plans for the next budget, as Ghagrid served as Treasurer. This means that the next Treasurer will need to step up their game, if the government want to produce a Budget this term.


[23-Jun-21 05:53 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The Government is facing a significant reshuffle which will shape the future of this nation. We could see the SDP adopt portfolios that were previously served in by the former Leader of the Australian Democrats, possibly causing the government to shift slightly to the left on their policy agenda.


[23-Jun-21 05:55 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Now onto more breaking news that happened over the weekend!


[23-Jun-21 05:59 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The Country Labor Party comfortably won in Green Heartland, breaking the Green wall of Nicholls, causing the Greens to lose one of their core constituencies. This election win by the CLP was an upset, as polling during and before the by-election campaign had the Greens on track to win re-election.

{Reactions}
üòé 

[23-Jun-21 06:05 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Australians are waking up to the out of touch Green Party, and we should definitely expect them to lose seats at the next election. The Nationals also outperformed polls, and did better than the last election securing a 9% swing in their favour.


[23-Jun-21 06:07 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Australians in the regions are rejecting the inner city policies put forward to them by the major parties, as seen at the by-election. The regional and rural movement is growing, and it looks like the CLP and National Party will thrive in the storm.

The discussion around Nuclear Energy has started to energise, with parties, and people against Nuclear Energy running a relatively strong campaign against the use of Nuclear Energy in Australia. This discussion, and movement against Nuclear has been sparked by legislation which repeals the ban on Nuclear Energy, and allows its use for electricity generation.


[23-Jun-21 06:15 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Those against Nuclear Energy have made comparisons with Fukushima, and Chernobyl, which has led to public opinion shifting against Nuclear Energy. These references are not comparable, and should not be compared. We need to compare with the United States, and European Nations that have had successful Nuclear Power Plants. Nuclear is a safe and reliable technology that must be adopted, to ensure that we can have a reliable energy grid into the future.
