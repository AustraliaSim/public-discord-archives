@everyone Award winning journalist Richard Elbow is writing a detailed story on the alt account events of the last few days.


If anybody has any comments to make about their observations, concerns, frustrations, the ramifications, or any other comments on the issue, please DM me to see whether they might be included in the article. Thank you.

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 5:07.

Following the polling results Greens leader Mtmdog released the following statement: "I'm disappointed we only got 25% of the vote, but it's not too bad I guess for the first new poll."

It was later pointed out to him that the colours were in fact not representative of the parties, at which point he yelled something indistinguishable and rode off at high speed, until he came to a slight incline.

The News at 9, at 11 is not reflective of reality, nor any party's political opinion, and if taken as such, consult a doctor.

This is the News at 9, at 11 at 2:06.

The News at 9, at 11 would like to condemn the so-called media outlet Abbott's Onion for their continuing efforts to spread truth and honestly in Australian media.
We also roundly condemn the unfair and biased coverage they have been giving all parties, particularly their blatant favouritism of The Greens. 
This sort of typical leftie-biased-homosexual-agenda is expected from #abc-feed , an organisation described by revolutionary Marxists as 'a bit much really', but we expected more from independents such as Abbott's Onion! 
If this trend of objective and productive reporting continues, The News at 9, at 11 will have no choice but to organise a boycott of Abbott‚Äôs Onion, and believe us when we say, you will miss those nine subscribers, especially Gladys. 

The News at 9, at 11 is not affiliated with any political party, unlike the Abbott‚Äôs Onion who are clearly a Socialist Party mouthpiece. The opinions expressed within are the author‚Äôs alone, and he‚Äôs been very busy lately scabbing at Fairfax Media.

In a shocking turn of events, it's apparent that the editor-in-chief for the News at 9, at 11 is infact the defendant in this case. A surprising turn of events as he was utterly unaware of this legal proceedings. Luckily being the paranoid and vicious sort of person he is, he  carries a large ledger of incriminating documents against everyone with them at all times.

We would also like to take this opportunity to slander the parties involved in this sordid affair. 
First off Mtmdog is a known terrorist supporter, smelly hippy and friend to small disgusting animals. Widely regarded as an idiot who has all the ideological consistency of a custard where too much milk has been added, his 'contributions' to AustraliaSim have damaged the sim significantly and his poor attempts at humour have caused permanent damage to the English language.

Justice Bellman has brought down not only the credibility of the High Court, but also the credibility of the entire concept of a legal system through his widespread corruption. We at the News at 9, at 11 attempted to bribe him, but his secretary, who is also his wife, attempted to charge us $50 just to see the book which outlined the bribe levels he accepted. Not only this, she then attempted to solicit a bribe of $40 to see the book.

We have a special report from Citizen John Galt of the Taxpayers Alliance 'Whilst I don't believe in the death penalty normally, it is clear that @LordTrollsworth , @People's Commissar Mtmdog , @Bellm…ônTGM J [ABC] and @TWF | Honesty & Childlessness probably deserve it for their outrageous acts. You can't just steal someone else's chicken and chips and expect to get away with it. Not in this economy. That's what today is about, right?'

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 3:15. This week we come to you from a secure location in the Simpson Desert, as the wave of fear sweeping the country due to the threat of frivolous litigation under the CoC has affected us too. As the death squads stalk the street searching for any one who expresses anything that could be considered even mildly offensive, a flag flys above the black stone structure where a certain nameless party resides with the words 'The Judicary are corrupt' embroidered on it. We sent a reporter to enquire about it, however they accidentally questioned the receptionist and are now serving 10 years hard labor. 

Greens Senator Mtmdog, long time enemy of this paper, and noted idiot, is still on the run. If seen the public are instructed to stay clear and contact the authorities. A reminder that listening to his incoherent ranting which masquerades as a political ideology can cause fatal brain hemorrhage.


[21-Jun-17 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Meanwhile in the Libertarian paradise that is the smouldering ruins of Melbourne, the oligarchy of Lord Trollsworth, John Galt and Mr Kruschev continue to grow in power. The unlikely alliance formed after a night of heavy drinking caused the two members to come around to Libertarianism. Senator for Victoria The White Ferret was unavailable for comment as he is currently building a new city just outside of Bendigo, it is understood he is currently half way through the first house, with construction on the city expected to be finished somewhere around 2100. 

In other governmental news the new Australian Democrats / Greens / One Nation government has continued the standards set by previous governments by not accomplishing anything. We approached Deput y PM IG 99 about why this may be, but it was stripper night at his parliamentary office and our reporter became distracted and forgot to get a comment.

This has been the News at 9, at 11, at 3:30. 

The opinions expressed within are the authors alone, any challenge will be met with Trial by Combat and the author is good friends with noted headbutt enthusist George Calombaris

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 7:30ish, to be honest our sundial doesn't work so well after sundown.

Things are looking up in the country today as the reassuring silence from the new government continues. We caught up with despotic warlord John Galt  in his Libertarian fortress in the burnt out husk of the MCG. "It's great, finally the government isn't interfering in our business and life has never been better, why this morning I finally got delivery of my gold plated car I can now afford thanks to not having to pay taxes." 

Former Prime Minister LordTrollsworth phoned into our offices from his beachfront resort, enjoying a well deserved drink, to tell us "the new government will never do as good a job as the Democrats, we heard they've even started to have positions on matters which may not be so inoffensively moderate as to be totally unworkable, I can't see how that's going to help their approval numbers."

To more serious matters now, the Australian Electoral Commission has grave fears for the safety and well being of The Nationals. Last seen in the area of Queensland, they're reported to be 1-4 members in numbers, with a fondness for all things 'wew' related. If you spot a National, do not approach them as they're both very skittish, and highly litigious. Instead, please contact RunasSudo c/o the AEC, Jervis Bay Territory.

Senate President Dicky Knee was today seen chasing Justice Bellman across the Parliament House lawns while dressed as Queen Victoria, loudly singing Rule Britannia, and smoking a cigar. "He usually does it on Thursday, but his calendar is still stuck on 1957 so he's a bit confused" said his carer "he's basically harmless, he'll tire himself out this way, then we put him to bed and read him a few pages from Wisden's 'and he's out like a light" 

Finally, Minister for Defence, Education, the Environment and Health, Mtmdog has made clear that he is going to launch a full scale war on climate change. "We have to fight it head on!" he said when talking to our reporter in his tree house somewhere in the West of Tasmania (but actually in the backyard of his parent's place in Melbourne) "climate change is our greatest enemy, as as minster for defence I will use the full force of the ADF to fight it!" 

This has been the News at 9, at 11, at oh... sometime around 8? 

All opinions within are the view of the author alone and not linked to any political party. 

We'd like to take this opportunity to state that the Abbott's Onion is a fine publication, no other news articles absorb the droppings of the office Owl quiet as well.

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 10:00.

Tonight we bring you an exclusive with Greens' party spokesperson Harmony Waterfall. Ms. Waterfall thanks for joining us tonight.

Can you comment on the recent buzz that the Greens are planning a massive sugar subsidy, with the aim of making Australia's children so fat they won't be able to do anything to harm the environment?

*puts on wig and jumps into opposite chair* "We can confirm that we are planning such a subsidy. At our most recent moonlight chill sesh and drum circle, one of our Party elders had a vision, in which the environment was totally pristine. They realised that what causing all the environmental damage was people, and that by nipping the problem at the bud, when they're little nippers, we can prevent all this damage from continuing."

*takes off wig, hops back into other chair* "I see. So your aim is to remove all future generations of people, in order to save the environment. Don't you think that's a bit extreme?"

*puts wig back on sloppily, slips over the middle table, clambers into chair* "No way, it's a totally Green way to save the planet, no one is hurt at all." 

*holds wig off head* "What about all the children who will die?" 

*puts wig back on with one hand* "Well they're mostly white children, and half are men, who'll probably grow up to be oppressors so they're not really people"

*pulls wig off* "Well, a bold change in direction for a venerable party, we'll see how it goes. Thank you for joining us Ms. Waterfall."

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 2:45.

Today the AEC has announced that at the next election there will be seperate polling booths setup for those voting for minor parties, out of sight of the regular polling booths.

"We found that the sort of people who vote for minor parties are likely to be a bit strange looking, maybe have some tats, or even openly express different opinions, frankly it was upsetting the Liberal and Labor voters" said AEC spokesman, RunasSudo. "These new booths have straw on the floor, and are easily hosed down so we can get them clean once the minors have finished voting." 

"This seems a sensible measure to take, if these *people* are going to insist on voting minor, I don't see why I should have to put up with seeing and smelling them" said lifelong Liberal voter Mrs. Suzanne Ruthershanks-Hutchens. 

The AEC is also rumoured to be looking at the deployment of stone slates and chisels for those planning to vote Australian Conservative, who're said to be afraid of the 'blackmagic' of pencils and paper.

This is the News at 9, at 11, at... good God, 9! This has never happened before.

Ahem. Sorry about that.

The Liberal Conservatives (Not a typo, we checked) today released their manifesto. Though it contained many glaring errors, everyone at least agreed that the grammar was correct. 

Co-Leader and current musical parties champion PaulKeating (no relation) was heard to say "we worked long and hard on this, it took a lot of work to erase the word 'democrats' from the title, and make sure it didn't appear anywhere else in the document."

It is expected that the party will release more policy in the weeks to come, or that several parties will release new manifestos bearing a striking resemblance to this one.

This has been the News at 9, at 11, at 9. We're sorry, it won't happen again.

The News at 9, at 11, is not affiliated with any political party, or individual. Collectivised journalistic farms are the future, and correspondent Kulaks will be rounded up and shot.

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 3:35.

Trotskyites Australia wide are furious today, over the constant splitting of right wing parties, a trend started by the 1st Prime Minister of AustraliaSim, TPF.

Valentina, a 20 year old arts student at ACU said "It's outrageous, these right wingers splitting into new parties with effectively the same name, and same policies, but claiming to be wildly different and truly representative of the right of politics; that's our thing! Apart from the right wing politics of course."

Meanwhile Canberra's sign makers have been kept busy by the constant need for signs with some variation on 'X Liberal X Party'. 

It's unknown when this rush of right wing parties will end, but what is clear, is the profoundly positive effect it is having on right wing parties. Specifically, One Nation, the only right wing party not to split apart into 3 other parties.

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 11:30.

Today the Australian Greens have announced that, following the recent trend of those who share the exact same ideologies forming multiple parties for no apparent reason, they will be splitting into their component parts. The new parties are to be the Australian Blues and the Australian Yellows, though the Australian Greens will continue to exist when the other two parties align.

This has been the News at 9, at 11.

The news at 9, at 11 uses the same fact checking service as Sky News, saving untold amounts of money by refusing to interact with the concept of reality, consequently nothing written here should be taken as fact, or orally, unless with a strong drink.

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 8ish.

As a part of a push to make Australia‚Äôs armed forces more modern and inclusive, the ADF today announced that it will no longer use the word ‚Äòoffence‚Äô. 

Brigadier General Francis ‚ÄòSunflower‚Äô Singrove, newly appointed head Social Justice Warrior of the ADF stated ‚Äúwe feel that ‚Äòoffensive‚Äô is just too harsh a term for this modern world. We would never go out with the intention to cause offense to any persons, regardless of their gender, race or creed, we‚Äôre simply there to kill them, not offend.‚Äù 

The new armed forces policy is that offensives will not be issued, however they state that if the opposing force chooses to take their ‚Äòpurposeful movements‚Äô as offensives, that is something the ADF cannot help.

This is the News at 9, at 11, at 12:15

As the country prepares to go to the polls, the AEC is puzzled by the apparent disappearance of over 60% of registered voters.

"We don't understand it" said AEC chief RunasSudo "while parliament was in session the rest of the country apparently let themselves out the backdoor!" 

Local religious leaders have a different theory. "The current theory we're working under is that most of Australia, except our politicians have been raptured. We see this as being eminently possible, as anyone with the good moral sense not to engage in the dirty business of politics is certain to be on a fast track to heaven." 

This theory also explains the sudden and mysterious disappearance of John Galt, noted concerned citizen and tax haven enthusiast. 

One thing is for sure, voter satisfaction with candidates is at an all time high. This is likely due to the fact that going into this election, almost half of those casting votes, are also running for election.

This special edition wishes to address the large amount of fake news currently being peddled by the "so called" news media. Obviously Senator BloodyChrome has not been shot, instead he has been enjoying a pleasant dinner with my family, who under the terms set by the court he gets access to every 3rd Wednesday of the month, except in September when it's the first Wednesday. 

It's reported that they had smoked salmon, with a lovely garlic aoili and some steamed greens on the side. Not what I would have gone for, but the Judge was clear I have no control over this.


[06-Sep-17 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is also apparent that they had a red wine with dinner. Barbarians.

The ASIO and the AFP has intercepted an encrypted message being sent to the mobile phone of BloodyChrome in large, spam quantities 3 hours before the shooting.

The contents read: 4dqStv9YATDwxwTeD1UOSfZAgwyQb+hc8w6Tjx2nhg2axMcbBAg+9/0rZHqPf/x+WuJKNwjfLHODdYz9nVk+8Wy4+ABd8Te7EKZF4c9wxznu4QXZlfHcfW0ZWn+zQtTY0tIvul214pQunqVwqnHtDleUFWckJ9G98pkFdv6uoOY=

Thank you for attending this press conference on short notice. I can confirm that @Deleted User has been charged with the attempted murder of Senator BloodyChrome. Investigations are continuing into the whereabouts of a second subject who may have been involved  in this horrific attack. The Senator is currently in a serious but stable condition and at his family's request I ask the media to refrain from approaching them and attempting to follow them with cameras at home or at the hospital or anywhere inbetween. Tonight's question time will happen under tight police presence as we have seen around parliament today, I ask that anyone intending on visiting parliament house, regardless of who you are, follows the directions of the AFP at all times. That is all for now.

The AFP have found this note near the crime scene, claiming that the attackers "will not be stopped" and will "keep trying until [they] succeed" to attack the Senator.

@here Question Time will take place in a high security environment. It is advised that you arrive at Parliament House as early as possible as security queues will be far longer than normal.

The military and law enforcement are working together in an unprecedented effort to ensure your security.

@Deleted User will be handcuffed and be allowed to attend and participate in the session. He will be kept secure thanks to collaboration from several of the aforementioned agencies.

**BREAKING - There will be a press conference in relation to the incident regarding Senator BloodyChrome on the steps of Canberra Hospital at 8PM AEST. National Review will be reporting from the event.**


[07-Sep-17 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
First of all I would like to thank everyone who expressed sympathy and support to myself and to my family. This attack is not just an attack on me or on the Australian Democrats it is an attack on the Liberal Democracy that underpins our system of government. It is an attack on the voters right to choose their representatives, an attack on core Australian values and an attack on every Australian citizen that values the rule of law and our democratic freedoms that this country holds so dear. While I am not fully recovered and still a long way to go I thank the staff of Canberra Hospital and of the ACT medical response teams that all assisted in saving my life and putting me on the road to recovery. I have every faith in the AFP's role in bringing those who wish to erode our liberal democratic rights to justice and their work in preventing repeats. This sort of action must not and can not be tolerated in this country and this government will not stand for it


[07-Sep-17 07:36 PM] djello#5901
Senator! What is your recollection of the events which occured last night?


[07-Sep-17 07:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
I recall leaving Parliament last night and as I tend to do go for a walk around the grounds, all I recall is a sharp searing pain in my chest before waking up in a hospital bed


[07-Sep-17 07:38 PM] djello#5901
Why do you believe that you were specifically targeted?


[07-Sep-17 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
While I won't deny that my brash temperament in Parliament does not sometimes rub people up the wrong way, there is no excuse for anyone to shoot anyone else simply because there are disagreements. To do so is to throw out all that is right and justified in our society and we should not allow that to change


[07-Sep-17 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Senator! Sky News here, why do you think this is a target on your political party and not just a lone attack on you personally?


[07-Sep-17 07:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not sure of any motivations yet but to attack any politician or any political party is an affront to Australian values and our system of government. The will of the voters should be respected and upheld as is their right and to attack any politician or target a particular political party is to attack all Australians


[07-Sep-17 07:43 PM] djello#5901
Senator!


[07-Sep-17 07:43 PM] djello#5901
How are you feeling personally? Do you feel your security has been compromised?


[07-Sep-17 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is the first assassination attempt in Australia since 1997 and I am thankful that the staff at Canberra Hospital were able to make it just an attempt. I feel that security may have lapsed but I as we are still not aware of the exact circumstances on how I was killed that answer can't yet be answered fully


[07-Sep-17 07:46 PM] _slothsworth#4496
Senator! ABC Correspondent here! I recently spoke with MrUnited, in an exclusive interview. What do you think his involvement is? Do you have anything to say to him?


[07-Sep-17 07:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would certainly hope that members of Parliament have not resorted to attacking others or arranging others to kill members. If the allegations are true it would be extremely upsetting that a colleague has decided to attack others simply due to a disagreement


[07-Sep-17 07:48 PM] djello#5901
One last question Senator!


[07-Sep-17 07:49 PM] djello#5901
Is there anything that you'd like to say to your attackers?


[07-Sep-17 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
As I said it is cowardly act, it is not just an attack on me but an attack on all Australians and our way of life. I would also like to say that no matter who you are or how many there are of you the AFP and other government agencies will find you and ensure that this cowardly act is dealt with.

This is the News at 9, at 11, at about 6pm.

Today the nation has gone to the poles.

The Polish invasion struck without warning as the sun rose this morning, with the often annex central European state quickly seizing Queensland, the Northern Territory and New South Wales down to Gosford. 
Thankfully, nothing of value was lost in the invasion. 

It is believed that the Polish are looking for new lands to colonise to escape the inevitable Russian invasion and consequent partition of their country.
Unfortunately by landing in the northern part of Australia, they will simply end up as a part of the new Chinese Empire, rumoured to be unveiling sometime later this year.

In order news the sad attempts to prop up the long irrelevant institution of 'democracy' continue in the remnants of Australia, with an utterly inconsequential election taking place, this paper wishes to encourage everyone to stay at home and not vote.

The News at 9, at 11, is not affiliated with any party. In addition, all words printed within carry the full legal weight of the High Court, making them conveniently able to be carried on the back of a small sparrow migrating for the summer.

So much as expected then from the By-Elections, with the Socialists holding on to Lingiari after losing it when their former deputy resigned and the Liberty Party gaining the seat of Kingston.

With all seats now confirmed once more the negotiations and backroom dealings can commence. The Socialists or the Greens seem to be in the best position to gain the nod, the Socialists having the most seats in the house will wield a lot of power when it comes to deciding who wins government in this election. The Liberty Party now have three seats and will look to cobble together a patch work coalition with the Republican Party, the Social Democrats and the Imperials. 

Ultimately the kingmakers may be the Centre Alliance. The party has already stated they won't enter in coalition with anyone, but the confidence of their two members in parliament are going to be needed by both sides if they're going to get to the magic number of 9.

In the end whichever party wins the right to form government in this election will have to face a political minefield the likes of which has not been seen in parliament. There is still a chance also that NO ONE can form a stable majority and we might all be back at the polls for another election of the House of Representatives in a week or two. 

The voters of Australia have spoken and the major words coming from them seems to be confusion. It certainly be a trying time for all parties over the next few hours or possibly days as they desperately try to find the numbers. 

After a long and arduous election campaign, Australia waits to see who comes out of this minefield with their hand raised in victory

Till next time. This is Jefferson Dufflecoat for AusSim Radio Network. Stay tuned now for our Sunday Afternoon feature "Antony Green: Making Psephology Sexy"

This is Jefferson Dufflecoat for AusSim Radio Network with your Monday Morning news recap.

AusSim finally has a government. After an exhausting and sometimes brutal three week campaign that involved multple supplementary elections, members winning and then vacations seats and mammoth amounts of vitriol from all sides it was the Liberty Party who claimed victory after hours of dealing, putting their leader Bellman in the Lodge

His stay may be short lived however, in a press conference announcing the coalition that saw him claim victory, Bellman admitted that the governmental alliance was only formed for one reason, to pass election reform before calling Australia back to the polls.

This has led to widespread comdemnation from a nation weary of the election fight, while many see the need for electoral reform, the fact that Australia could be back at the polls in just a few short weeks has left many scratching their heads as to why such a move was allowed to be put together.

Leading the charge for those against the call for an early elections is the Soclalist Party's leader, Bsharri. He has been vocal in his objection to these plans, both in private and across social media. Insiders in the halls of parliament have said the Socialists may table a motion of no confidence in the government to bring this situation to a head. Even if with the other parties united in suppling the government such a move would seem doom to fail.

Nonetheless for now AusSim has a government and a new Prime Minister. The next week in Australian politics could be one of the most pivotal seen as the moves all play out. 

That's your Monday Morning Update on AusSim Radio Network. Stay tuned for our Monday Morning Feature "Kaarrien: From Wollongong to Wollongone"

BREAKING NEWS: Is a vote of no confidence in the Bellman Government soon to break? Speaker of the House and influential Independent General_Rommel took to social media after the Government announced plans to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel that he quote "Personally cannot wait to do a Vote of No Confidence in the government."

While early indications would seem to indicate the Bellman government would have the numbers to survive a No Confidence motion on the floor, this is an unwelcome distraction and a reminder that the coalition holding the AusSim Government together is tenuious at best

Stay tuned to AusSim Radio Network for further updates. We return you now to our regularly scheduled program.

Assuming everyone turns up to vote in this motion of No Confidence the Bellman government appears doomed, With the Socialists's 5 members voting for the motion plus the greens 2 and the independent General Rommel. The motion already has 8. The Imperial party took part in the walkout at Question Time with the socialists as well, so if their member MrU voted for the motion, that would give them the 9 votes they need for the motion to pass. 

If any miss the vote however the motion may come down to the choice of the two Centre Alliance members, who are as yet undecided. While they do have a Supply deal in place with the Bellman Government they may see the writing on the wall and jump ship. 

It will certainly be a busy few days in Canberra as members of both sides go scrambling for the numbers.

Today, we're going through detail all 15 seats up for grabs in the Australian federal election, and calling all of them.

{Reactions}
üá® (2) üÖæÔ∏è üá¥ üá± 

[06-Apr-20 10:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, a quick overview. The Social Democrats have run a very good campaign. I think that out of the 15 seats, there are only 2 that are unwinnable for them- Cowper and Sydney.


[06-Apr-20 10:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
The Social Democrats ran in every seat across the country.


[06-Apr-20 10:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
The Nationals, meanwhile, ran in 12, and out of those 12 I couldn't see them winning half of them.


[06-Apr-20 10:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberals, meanwhile, only ran 3 candidates, and while I would say they could win all of them, it's still a surprisingly small amount.


[06-Apr-20 10:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
The newly founded Greens only ran in the blue-ribbon seat of Moncrieff, and polling alongside a lacklustre campaign means they're unlikely to win.


[06-Apr-20 10:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
So, let's go through the seats in alphabetical order. We've also classified the seats between "lean"- which means it could perhaps change, or "safe".


[06-Apr-20 10:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
First seat.


[06-Apr-20 10:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Brisbane- LEAN IND**
The seat of Brisbane, formerly held by independent-turned-Socialist MP BabyYodaVevo before she disappeared. The seat has been vacant since then. MP for Moncrieff Zak6858 is attempting to transfer to Brisbane, but is facing an opponent from the SDP in Wanuke. While the SDP have run a good campaign here, Zak has the advantage of incumbency (to a degree) and an opposition endorsement.


[06-Apr-20 10:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Canberra- LEAN SDP**
Before this election, you could probably guarantee Youmaton would win here. They've held the seat for a while and romped in last time. But an unexpected challenge from Liberal MP for Mayo BloodyChrome has made this seat competitive. Youmaton's status as the incumbent, having run an active campaign, means the SDP is still likely to retain.


[06-Apr-20 10:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Capricornia- LEAN SDP**
This is a bit of a bold call, but despite a large majority, ARichTeaBiscuit of the SDP has run a strong campaign. The Liberals have allowed themselves to be eclipsed by the Nationals, and the confluence of all of this means the SDP has a real shot.


[06-Apr-20 10:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Cowper- SAFE NAT**
With MerrilyPutrid, who has previously challenged incumbent AussieConservative, transferring to Melbourne, this seems like a foregone conclusion. AussieConservative has run a good campaign and the SDP has abandoned this seat, it's one of two they won't win.


[06-Apr-20 10:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Cunningham- LEAN SDP**
The incumbent hasn't been particularly active in Parliament, and is facing a spirited challenge from the Liberals. However, a good enough campaign, the advantage of incumbency, and the SDP label will probably mean rhaums, the incumbent, wins here.


[06-Apr-20 10:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Denison- LEAN IND**
The incumbent superpacman04 has retired, and in his place, the Nationals have chosen not to contest, instead endorsing independent and long-time MP for Denison dyljam, who is up against BHjr132 of the SDP. Both candidates have run a good campaign, but dyljam has the advantage of name recognition on the Apple Isle.


[06-Apr-20 10:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Hotham- SAFE SDP**
While this electorate in Melbourne's south-east has previously been competitive, not so at this election. The Nationals have done little campaigning, leading incumbent mikiboss to a fairly safe re-election.


[06-Apr-20 11:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Lingiari- LEAN SDP**
Bit of a controversial call, but despite Caeslius, the incumbent, resigning, he was still a representative of the SDP, who won narrowly against the Country Liberals last time around. The SDP has the advantage here, with an active candidate and doing well nationally.


[06-Apr-20 11:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
With 8 seats called, here's the update-
SDP- 5
Nationals- 1
Independent- 2


[06-Apr-20 11:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Mayo- SAFE SDP**
While this seat traditionally has been a tossup, like Hotham, the opposition has neglected to pour any serious resources into defending this seat- it seems MattMonti will finally win Mayo back.


[06-Apr-20 11:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Melbourne- LEAN NAT**
This has been a close campaign. After GHagrid surprisingly unseated Labor MP Lok1999, the SDP's MerrilyPutrid is fighting to retake it, having run a somewhat eccentric campaign. While the SDP has put a lot of effort here, so have the Nationals, and with the advantage of incumbency, this will likely go to the Nationals.


[06-Apr-20 11:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Moncrieff- SAFE NAT**
While Greens leader TheOWOTrongle has put in effort to try and win here, he's been eclipsed by the Nationals' My13InchDuck, who is polling just above 50%. The Greens' risky bid of putting all their eggs in one basket appears to have failed, Moncrieff will almost certainly go to the Nationals.

[06-Apr-20 11:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Nicholls- SAFE IND**
Since the retirement of South Gippsland Network MP AnswerMeNow1, showstealer1829 has had Nicholls for 2 terms, and despite a close shave last term, faces only token opposition from the SDP.


[06-Apr-20 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Pearce- SAFE SDP**
Given the margin of the seat, a Portillo moment may have been possible, but the Nationals haven't put much effort in Pearce. PM NGSpy, with a fairly good campaign and a national profile, will pull out.


[06-Apr-20 11:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Robertson- LEAN SDP**
Some may question both the lean status and the SDP status, but, even though Jayden Williamson has a high profile, he's faced a strong challenge from the Nationals candidate Winston_Wilhelmus, and even though polling suggests an easy SDP victory, we aren't so sure.


[06-Apr-20 11:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
And finally...


[06-Apr-20 11:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Sydney- LEAN NAT**
While the independent and ex-MP for Robertson Gregor_The_Beggar has put in a lot of effort here, so has riley8583, and given his national status and incumbency, it seems likely the National Party will hold Sydney.


[06-Apr-20 11:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
So, where does that leave Parliament?


[06-Apr-20 11:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
SDP- 8 (3 safe)
Nationals- 4 (2 safe)
Independent- 3 (1 safe)


[06-Apr-20 11:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
The SDP will likely face trouble in the Senate, however, where they need to win 3/4 seats for a majority. But even then, a very good map for the SDP.

In the House, the target number is 8.


[07-Apr-20 05:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
8 is what a party or a coalition needs for a majority, 8 out of 15 seats to govern.


[07-Apr-20 05:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Both the SDP and the Nationals, have stood enough candidates to gain outright majorities theoretically. No other party has.


[07-Apr-20 05:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Meanwhile, in the Senate, the SDP needs 3 seats to seize a Senate majority.


[07-Apr-20 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
No other party can win a Senate majority, only a plurality.


[07-Apr-20 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
While it is unlikely the SDP will win a majority in the Senate, given that they would need to win at least 62% of the vote, 4 seats would be enough to block any possible opposition legislation, but either way, it seems as if we may be looking at a 4-4 split in the Senate.

Now, let's look at the target seats for the SDP.


[07-Apr-20 05:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
They will be hoping to score wins in Brisbane, Capricornia, Mayo, Melbourne and Denison. Let's take a closer at these seats.


[07-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Brisbane, incumbent far-left MP BabyYodaVevo has disappeared and MP for neighbouring Moncrieff, Zak6858, is contesting as an independent, while the SDP is standing Flarelia.


[07-Apr-20 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Capricornia, the SDP will be hoping to score a high-profile scalp in Liberal leader TheAudibleAsh, with SDP candidate ARichTeaBiscuit having run a good campaign.


[07-Apr-20 06:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Mayo, the SDP may have initially been expecting a tough campaign, but after BloodyChrome, the incumbent MP, decided to contest Canberra, the SDP's MattMonti looks to have much more of an easy run.


[07-Apr-20 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Melbourne, the SDP is attempting to unseat sophomore MP GHagrid, standing union leader MerrilyPutrid. A competitive campaign has made this seat interesting, and may be an upset come results.


[07-Apr-20 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
And finally, in Denison, the incumbent National who won at a by-election- superpacman04- is retiring, and the Nationals aren't recontesting, instead endorsing independent dyljam, while the SDP is standing BHjr132.


[07-Apr-20 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, looking at the Nationals targets.


[07-Apr-20 06:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Nationals are targeting Lingiari, Robertson, and Moncrieff.


[07-Apr-20 06:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Lingiari, incumbent Caeslius is stepping down, and the SDP has fielded Copelonian to replace him. At the last election, this was a close race between the SDP and the Country Liberals, but the former won out by 2.9%. The Nationals are fielding CardboardGradient, who has run a good campaign, making this race likely close.


[07-Apr-20 06:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Robertson, incumbent Jayden_Williamson of the SDP is up against the controversial Winston_Wilhelmus, who has run a strong campaign, if one that has tended to eschew social distancing. However, polls show that Jayden_Williamson has the advantage here.


[07-Apr-20 06:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Moncrieff, incumbent independent MP Zak6858, who unseated Liberal Minister for Finance PineappleCrusher_ in an upset last election, is transferring to Brisbane, leaving this seat vacant. My13InchDuck has run a strong campaign here, up against Greens leader TheOWOTrongle, who has run a weaker campaign, and zhuk236 of the SDP. Polls show My13InchDuck leading in primary votes.


[07-Apr-20 06:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
And finally, to seats that the Liberals are targeting.


[07-Apr-20 06:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
There are only two- Canberra and Cunningham, and given the Liberals hold Capricornia, it is quite clear that the Liberals want to become the clearest campaigner in seats starting with C.


[07-Apr-20 06:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Canberra, the SDP's Youmaton is being challenged jointly by BloodyChrome of the Liberals and Elleeit of the Nationals, however polls suggest that between the two coalition candidates, BloodyChrome has the advantage, after having transferred from the seat of Mayo. Both parties have expended a lot of effort here, and the SDP will likely need to crack the high 40s in this seat to hold it.


[07-Apr-20 06:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
A similar situation in Cunningham, where sophomore MP rhaums is being challenged by former Senator stranger195. stranger195 has run a good campaign, and seemingly put rhaums on the ropes. Polls show rhaums still leads on primary vote, but that may change after preferences.


[07-Apr-20 06:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
So, there we go. The 10 seats that the parties want to claim.

This would suggest that the SDP holds an ever-so-slight lead against the Nationals, but a very close one.

Always superior, we pipped Nine News to the post.

On these numbers, it looks like the SDP may be in for a good night, but things are still close, especially considering the SDP numbers are going backwards on 2PP when compared to the last poll.

And now, we go live to our roving transcribe reporters on the scene. We have reporters in Richmond (Melbourne), Cronulla (Cunningham), Inala (Brisbane), Canberra (Canberra) and Townsville (Capricornia).

First, let's go to Lilly Harvey in Inala.

"Thanks model-amn, and today I'd say it's been pretty interesting. The party volunteers tended to keep their distance, less people took how to vote cards, and overall, there was a sense of something in the air. They're counting inside, now but across the day the voters I spoke with tended to be split. I think it'll go down to the wire here."

Liberty Reform? That's interesting. But I think it might be good for now to take a closer look at the Senate.

On the numbers we have in the exit poll, it looks like it'll be an even split- 2-2, given the low Liberal vote and the 2PP.


[07-Apr-20 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
This would make things difficult for both sides, however likely moreso for a prospective Nationals government given they would face a unified opponent.

The SDP may be able to sway the Liberal on certain wedge issues, but there would be no honeymoon for NGSpy.

Both left-and-right, they ignore the rise of Sudanese and African gangs that target white people. Many of these MPs even display anti-white racism themselves.

When a motion to honour Captain Hemi Cook, the discoverer of this nation, came to Parliament, sitting MPs attacked this national hero because he was white.

SnecBoi is within the margin of error here, and given the CLP's poor performance in Capricornia, this will likely be their only chance to win a seat in the lower house.

The seats of Robertson, Denison and Pearce are on a knife edge, and the Liberals could recieve as many as 11 seats.


[01-Jul-20 08:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
However, the path for the SDP to government is extremely fraught. They may win the seats of Cowper or Brisbane, but no more, which would get them to 5 seats.

Here, they would need the support of 3 out of 4 crossbenchers.

There are no real other marginals apart from perhaps Nicholls, where SDP-backed showstealer1829 may prevail, and there is the less likely but still notable possibility of West Wimmeran nationalist EdenhopeStan being elected.

We simulated the two party-preferred vote of all 15 seats in the House of Representatives 1000 times to project the likely outcomes- an LNP majority, an SDP majority, or a hung parliament- based off polling results.

We should note- these are not how many votes we think the party will go. We don't expect stranger195 to win 75%- but we believe that he has a 75% chance at winning.


[03-Jul-20 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Whether he wins by 1 vote or by 10,000, we believe one way or another, he has a 75% chance of winning.


[03-Jul-20 03:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
We still believe it's more likely than not the LNP wins a majority, but with Nicholls being more competitive than expected, the odds are raised of a hung parliament.

Hello, I'm Adria Mitreli with the West Wimmera Advocate.


[11-Aug-20 10:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
We contacted all 8 Australian Senators to see if they'd support West Wimmeran statehood.


[11-Aug-20 11:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, of course, we can pencil down 3 people as existing supporters- TheGoatBoy2, who supported it in a debate, saying "I would like to say this is a good idea and we should let it go to a vote. This is a different part of Victoria with differnt needs and the ppl should be able to vote to make the best decison."


[11-Aug-20 11:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Gregor_The_Beggar, who proposed the bill and spoke in favour, saying "While I may not agree with the principle of West Wimmeran statehood, I do believe they have that choice."


[11-Aug-20 11:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
And of course, Griffonomics has voted in favour.


[11-Aug-20 11:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Let's reveal the responses of other Senators, now.

BHjr132 did not respond.

Phonexia2 told us that "I always support the will of the people but, when it comes to referendums, we need a few things to be clear. We need a clear question and a clear sense of support. What I do not want is a campaign of slander and populism, and I do not want to waste public resources on something doomed to failure."


[11-Aug-20 11:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Dennis Fox told us that "I really have not formed an opinion as of yet," and that he was on leave, we should note that his party, the UAP, supports it.


[11-Aug-20 11:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Due to Dennis being on leave, only 4 votes are required for passage.


[11-Aug-20 11:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
So everything comes down to the 2 remaining Senators, Captain_Plat_2258 and GHagrid.

At the time, Captain_Plat_2258 was on surgical leave and did not respond, her surgical leave expired yesterday.


[11-Aug-20 11:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
However, GHagrid told us that "I believe in Democracy and the people of West Wimmera should have a choice."


[11-Aug-20 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
However, his party, the Australian Democrats, has pledged to vote against the West Wimmera Statehood Bill.


[11-Aug-20 11:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
This leaves 3 Senators as almost certain yes votes, 4 Senators up in the air, and 1 Senator who has pledged to vote yes, but which conflicts with his party's policy.

The #media channel is back. This channel is freely available for media outlets that don't have their own channel and for other press stuff. It is currently open for anyone to post but if it gets abused it will have to move to only be open to those that request access.
