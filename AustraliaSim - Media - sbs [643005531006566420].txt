Hello Australia!


[17-Nov-19 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
So let's begin with Cowper, where upstart independent MerrilyPutrid is firing arrows at this traditionally conservative blue-ribbon seat. Polling shows her on 34%, but with AussieConservative still likely to win after leaving the Senate. What are your thoughts?

Now, as I said before the Prime Minister tried to obtain the furry vote, was that I believe that Cowper has seen the light and I am expecting to win the seat and quickly get to work for the people of Cowper and Australia!


[17-Nov-19 08:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Cowper, the heart of Bogan country. I'd be surprised if it flipped to the SDP but surprises always happen in politics don't they?


[17-Nov-19 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
There's no SDP candidate running in Cowper, but MerrilyPutrid is SDP-endorsed.


[17-Nov-19 08:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
Indeed, your recent rise to the public stage has been quite interesting @Gregor The Beggar


[17-Nov-19 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Bogan Country? Please Explain!


[17-Nov-19 08:51 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
SDP-endorsed or not, when you've got the backing of one major party and no others you align someone with the party

Ahh, Moncreiff. I have many supporters up there you know and they miss me terribly.

I'd like to remind our audience preferences have not been distributed yet.


[17-Nov-19 08:59 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yes, it seems the panel is all predicting preferences going to the SDP


[17-Nov-19 08:59 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Interesting, since Moncrieff is usually a fairly conservative area


[17-Nov-19 09:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Depends which side of the isle UDP voters end up going towards, if we see a solid trend towards the SDP, it might reveal a greater rise in a center-left faction within the UDP?


[17-Nov-19 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I was watching the Daily Boomerang, one of my trusted news sources and they predicted a 57-43 win to Mikiboss. It’s looking a bit closer 55 to 45


[17-Nov-19 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, let's see if the UDP voters have followed the party.

Odd, every member of the panel was predicting an SDP victory


[17-Nov-19 09:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But I guess the sheer force of personality behind PineappleCrusher_ was enough to push them over


[17-Nov-19 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
The UDP should learn their lesson of working with the socialists.


[17-Nov-19 09:05 PM] Youmaton#1190
That's.... Interesting. That's quite the rebellion from UDP preferences


[17-Nov-19 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000

Well, as a bit of a psephology expert, you could make the point of calling it a National gain as it was most recently won by the Liberals at the election.

Hello, welcome to Media Watch, I'm Caitlyn Hill.

First up tonight, Moncrieff mix-up. The Courier Mail broke the following story on 17 November 2019- "SDP candidate out of touch with Moncrieff".


[18-Nov-19 07:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
The story claimed that "a Social Democrat candidate has campaigned outside of their electorate and has directly lied about Liberal party policy."


[18-Nov-19 07:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is true that on 13 November, Social Democrat candidate for Moncrieff, mikiboss, campaigned in Warwick, where they spoke about their policies- "We support action on all of these issues, and we thing that the SDP can be the voice for Warwick and the voice for Moncrieff which will bring forward the change we need."


[18-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
We couldn't find any evidence in this speech of mikiboss misrepresenting or outright lying about Liberal Party policy, in fact, the only mention of the Liberals in their speech was this- "We may be opposed to the Liberals in many ways, and we will hold them to account harshly when elected, but we must do more than just say no, we must push for a comprehensive vision and alternative, A fair and free Australia, ready to fight for you."


[18-Nov-19 07:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
That hardly seems like misrepresentation. But what about the location of Warwick? The Courier Mail alleged that Warwick was in Capricornia.


[18-Nov-19 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Media Watch investigation has found one more instance of a politician campaigning in Warwick- Horror-HQ, then of the Social Democratic Party, campaigning for the seat of Wright. Horror-HQ, at the time, was fighting against independent CircleSongIsDank, and ultimately won with 57% of the vote.


[18-Nov-19 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Warwick does appear to be in Capricornia, however Media Watch were unable to get our hands on more detailed spatial data to prove this. Warwick has over 15,000 residents and is located in the Southern Downs region.


[18-Nov-19 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
So, did mikiboss make a mistake? That much is clear. But is the Courier Mail innocent? No.

But now, the recent vote of no confidence, and specifically, the role of the independent MP for Nicholls, showstealer1829.


[18-Nov-19 08:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the debate on the legislation, on November 3, they blasted both sides of Parliament, saying that the PM, dyljam and Youmaton had all failed the people of Australia, and that they would be abstaining.


[18-Nov-19 08:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Courier Mail attacked the MP for failing "to supply confidence", saying that "his vote against the Government ensured that Australia would go back to the ballot boxes for the 2nd time in just over a month. Lucky for him that the Member for Mayo, MattMonti failed to vote."


[18-Nov-19 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
showstealer1829 labeled the article "a pile of trash", but the Courier weren't the only ones to attack showstealer.


[18-Nov-19 08:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
dyljam tweeted that "‪It is only because of you that this Prime Minister is in power, and now you’re after the PMship yourself. Don’t parade around like some holy crusader. The Australian people can see through your deceit.‬

Welcome to SBS News. I'm Skye Fielding.

Later this week, SBS hopes to air an episode of Insight, for politicians to come on and discuss the issue of equality, moderated by myself. Any interested politicians can contact the SBS head offices.


[30-Dec-19 12:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
But first, the election.


[30-Dec-19 12:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
While campaigning has not yet begun, SBS has a rough list of some candidates which may contest electorates, and we'll discuss with you some of the races to watch of January's election.


[30-Dec-19 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
The first one is Cowper. In what looks to be a reprise of last month's by-election, AussieConservative of the Nationals and independent MerrilyPutrid will be up against each other.


[30-Dec-19 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
This seat is held by an 11.3% margin, and so it would take MerrilyPutrid a lot of campaigning to win it from the incumbent, AussieConservative.


[30-Dec-19 12:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Next up, Robertson.


[30-Dec-19 12:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
JaydenDaGamer15 is having their fifth tilt at the seat, with the SDP deputy trying to unseat incumbent independent MP Gregor_The_Beggar.


[30-Dec-19 12:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Gregor_The_Beggar, who was largely unknown before he launched his campaign, was able to win due to a lacklustre campaign from JaydenDaGamer15 at the last election. Will he able to reprise that victory, now as the incumbent defending the seat?


[30-Dec-19 12:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
We should also take a quick look at the Senate.


[30-Dec-19 12:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
At the previous Senate election, the Liberals won 2 seats, with the UDP picking up 1 and an independent, BellmanTGM, also winning one.


[30-Dec-19 12:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberals have a vacant seat, and their sole remaining Senator in the upper house, Anacornda, has jumped ship to the Social Democrats.


[30-Dec-19 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is unknown if Anacornda will recontest the Senate or attempt to move to the house, but regardless, it is likely the SDP will seek to gain another Senate seat.


[30-Dec-19 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
At the moment, 3 senators are continuing their term- one Liberal, one SDP and one Labor.

Or, in a less likely but possible scenario, advancedgaming12 resigns and seeks re-election as a Labor candidate.


[30-Dec-19 12:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
A party would most likely need to exceed 45% to gain more than 2 senate seats, which, while possible in the halcyon days of July 2019, is likely not possible now.


[30-Dec-19 12:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
It should also be noted only 3 tickets actually contested the July 2019 senate elections.


[30-Dec-19 12:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Nationals are a possibility, and are rumoured to have a large slate of candidates running.

[30-Dec-19 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ultimately, the Senate is much more dependent on whether parties have the resources to contest. If less than 4 tickets contest, one party will likely pick up multiple seats.


[30-Dec-19 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is however extremely unlikely that any party comes out of tonight with a majority, meaning whoever is in government come 12 January will need to deal with the crossbench.

uwu (3) 

[30-Dec-19 12:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is due to the fact that all parties are starting from 1 seat, and to gain 3 would require at least a majority of votes, and most likely in excess of 70%.

Welcome to SBS News, I'm Skye Fielding. The Social Democratic Party has unveiled a slate of candidates to contest the upcoming election.


[02-Jan-20 06:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Let's take a look at who they are.


[02-Jan-20 06:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Youmaton, the former leader of the SDP, will be recontesting Canberra.


[02-Jan-20 06:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Currently, no-one else has announced an intention to contest Canberra, but that may change.


[02-Jan-20 06:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
In Cunningham, the former seat of BHjr132, who is seemingly retiring at this election, former Senator rhaums will be contesting.


[02-Jan-20 06:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
Robertson is a seat that the Social Democrats appeared to have been targeting, and JaydenDaGamer15 will formally be recontesting this seat for the Social Democrats to attempt to unseat incumbent independent MP Gregor_The_Beggar.


[02-Jan-20 06:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
In Sydney, the Social Democrats are standing political newcomer DennisFox.


[02-Jan-20 06:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
We can't find much information about them.


[02-Jan-20 06:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Over to the NT, opposing the Country Liberal candidate Florence Murphy will be Caeslius, who stood as number 2 on the Senate ticket at the previous half-Senate election.


[02-Jan-20 07:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
In Queensland, the SDP is standing former MP for Shortland, HazardArrow.


[02-Jan-20 07:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well, in the seat of Brisbane, that is, likely against PM porriidge.


[02-Jan-20 07:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
Over in Capricornia, SDP candidate is SocialistAcid.


[02-Jan-20 07:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
In Mayo, the SDP are unsurprisingly standing MattMonti, the former MP for the seat. Lieseltaa, a former Senator for the Liberals, is seeking to claim the seat. MattMonti has a tough fight on his hands here, most likely, as she battles to be re-elected to Parliament. Honestly, the last time I can remember the possibility of a party winning the election but their leader losing was with Campbell Newman in Ashgrove.


[02-Jan-20 07:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
In Victoria, the SDP are only standing former candidate for Moncrieff, Mikiboss, in Hotham, in an attempt to gain the vacant seat.


[02-Jan-20 07:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
And in WA's sole seat, Pearce, NGSpy, the incumbent, will be recontesting for the SDP.


[02-Jan-20 07:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
Meanwhile, in the Senate, at the top of the ticket, the SDP are standing former Liberal Anacornda.


[02-Jan-20 07:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
In second place is Jq8678, whom we could find little about.


[02-Jan-20 07:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
In third is Negative-Leader, whom was the same.


[02-Jan-20 07:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
In last place, there's Secretary_Salami, but all we could find about them was that they were listed as a member of the SDP when they seeked registration with the AEC.


[02-Jan-20 07:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
And that, in a nutshell, are the SDP candidates for this election. Some will win, some will lose, some will really lose, and some may even make career ending gaps.

Welcome to Skye Fielding's Election Watch, the show that puts the 'Special' into Special Broadcasting Service.


[02-Jan-20 09:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Considering two major parties have announced candidates, it's time for an electorate preview!


[02-Jan-20 09:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Canberra**


[02-Jan-20 09:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
*Candidates*
:sdp: Youmaton 🇲 🇵


[02-Jan-20 09:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
So far, only the SDP's Youmaton has declared, as we can see.


[02-Jan-20 09:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Regardless, she is likely to hold this seat.


[02-Jan-20 09:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Cowper**


[02-Jan-20 09:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
*Candidates*
:National: AussieConservative 🇲 🇵 
✋ MerrilyPutrid


[02-Jan-20 09:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
In what seems to be a repeat of the November by-election, AussieConservative, the incumbent National MP, is facing up against independent candidate MerrilyPutrid.


[02-Jan-20 09:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
This may be a closer race, considering MerrilyPutrid has had the time to establish a profile in Cowper, but then again, so has AussieConservative.


[02-Jan-20 09:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Cunningham**


[02-Jan-20 09:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
*Candidates*
:sdp: rhaums
:National: Manly-Kitten


[02-Jan-20 09:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
Former Senator rhaums is contesting the marginal seat of Cunningham, with former MP for Cowper Manly-Kitten standing against her in this seat redistributed to be on Sydney's urban fringes.


[02-Jan-20 09:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
rhaums likely has the edge here.


[02-Jan-20 09:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Robertson**


[02-Jan-20 09:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
*Candidates*
:sdp: JaydenDaGamer15
✋ Gregor_The_Beggar 🇲 🇵


[02-Jan-20 09:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
The SDP, which has been making overtures towards Robertson recently, is attempting to unseat Gregor_The_Beggar.


[02-Jan-20 09:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Robertson is held on a 7.3% margin.


[02-Jan-20 09:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
**Lingiari**


[02-Jan-20 09:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
*Candidates*
:sdp: Caeslius
:National: Crab-Stick
:CountryLiberal: Florence_Murphy


[02-Jan-20 09:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Both the Nationals and SDP are standing two former Senate candidates in Lingiari, but the wildcard is Florence Murphy, leader of the Country Liberal Party, who kicked off her campaign earlier today in Darwin.


[02-Jan-20 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
There's been no word from incumbent MP BloodyChrome on whether he'll recontest.

:sdp: HazardArrow


[02-Jan-20 09:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
While only the SDP's HazardArrow has declared, incumbent MP and PM porriidge is likely to recontest, and if he does, it's in the bag for the Liberals.

*Candidates*
:sdp: SocialistAcid
:National: Infinitex9


[02-Jan-20 09:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Infinitex9 has previously contested the July 2019 senate election, while SocialistAcid is a political newcomer. However, it should be noted, TheAudibleAsh, the incumbent Liberal, is likely to recontest.

*Candidates*
:liberal: Lieseltaa
:sdp: MattMonti
:National: Greejatus


[02-Jan-20 09:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
MattMonti is seeking to recapture her old seat, but is facing a challenge from the Liberals' Lieseltaa. MattMonti will face another challenge as well from the National candidate Greejatus, and will likely need to repeat previous performances of around 50% to win this likely marginal seat.

Sorry for the glitch there, but superpacman04 is the National candidate.


[02-Jan-20 09:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hotham is held on a 6.4% margin and will likely be one of the key seats this election.


[02-Jan-20 09:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
The SDP has selected former candidate for Moncrieff, mikiboss, while former MP superpacman04 is recontesting.

In the regional Victorian seat of Nicholls, the only declared candidate is the National candidate Timewalker102.
*Please note: A previous version of this broadcast used slanderous and abusive language to refer to Timewalker102. That has been edited, and we wholeheartedly apologise to Timewalker102 and his ~~right hand~~ family.*


[02-Jan-20 09:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
But I should note, again, showstealer1829 is very likely to recontest.

*Candidates*
:sdp: NGSpy  🇲 🇵 
:National: Winston_Wilhelmus


[02-Jan-20 09:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Former Perth candidate Winston_Wilhelmus, who narrowly lost in March 2019, is contesting Pearce, against the incumbent MP NGSpy.


[02-Jan-20 09:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
This'll be a close race, most likely, with Pearce held on a 2.2% margin.


[02-Jan-20 09:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
And just quickly, TheAudibleAsh and porriidge will be recontesting their seats, the SBS can confirm, and we think they'll likely win.


[02-Jan-20 09:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, to the Senate.


[02-Jan-20 09:30 AM] Deleted User#0000

*Candidates*
:National: Elleeit
:Labor: lok1999  🇲 🇵


[02-Jan-20 09:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Melbourne is traditionally a marginalish seat which leans left, and lok1999 will likely hold this.


[02-Jan-20 09:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
And now, to the Senate.


[02-Jan-20 09:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberal and National parties will likely field a joint ticket, but so far the only declared candidate is National candidate Thomas0610, who will be second on the ballot.


[02-Jan-20 09:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
The SDP ticket, which we've already covered, is as follows, in order-

[29-Jan-20 05:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
Thats a great question Plups! RAID: Shadow Legendstm is an immersive online experience with everything you'd expect from a brand new RPG title. It's got an amazing storyline, awesome 3D graphics, giant boss fights, PVP battles, and hundreds of never before seen champions to collect and customize.

I never expected to get this level of performance out of a mobile game. Look how crazy the level of detail is on these champions!

RAID: Shadow Legendstm is getting big real fast, so you should definitely get in early. Starting now will give you a huge head start. There's also an upcoming Special Launch Tournament with crazy prizes! And not to mention, this game is absolutely free!

So go ahead and check out the video description to find out more about RAID: Shadow Legendstm. There, you will find a link to the store page and a special code to unlock all sorts of goodies. Using the special code, you can get 50,000 Silver immediately, and a FREE Epic Level Champion as part of the new players program, courtesy of course of the RAID: Shadow Legendstm devs.

[22-May-21 05:41 PM] NGSpy#8096
This is about international affairs, so I shall be starting off with one of the great elephants in the world, China.
My question is to you, how should Australia handle Chinese relations going forward, and what should our strategy be in regards to them. I'll start with @Deleted User first, but everyone get typing your answers.

[22-May-21 05:51 PM] NGSpy#8096

[22-May-21 05:51 PM] NGSpy#8096
@Napoleon Freeze Do you agree with what Mr. Caesar said, how do you think that the Australian government should deal with it?


[22-May-21 05:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
China is a really difficult problem for us politically. On one hand they are a massive export target for us and given their gigantic population are a market we just can’t ignore without accepting that there will be financial losses. On the other, their human rights are beyond questionable and their advances into nations which are normally in our realm is a major concern. Caution must be taken and thus I think it essential we have an exit plan in case something does go wrong long term but I wouldn’t just cut ties immediately.


[22-May-21 05:52 PM] NGSpy#8096
Thank you tbyrn


[22-May-21 05:52 PM] Joe1331#8241
I believe we should just completely cut ties with China without a vote. 
and also Force them to give back our sea ports.

[22-May-21 05:53 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yeah look quite simply here, I think that Tbyrn has made a wrong statement here


[22-May-21 05:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
yeah but which ports


[22-May-21 05:53 PM] NGSpy#8096
I'll side with tbyrn on this question.


[22-May-21 05:54 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I think the answer to this dispute might be somewhere in the middle. Perhaps half of the businesses will have to close, but the other half could be, as Joseph suggests, nationalised.


[22-May-21 05:54 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Tbyrn has claimed that China has made advances into nations which are normally in the realm of Australia but the fact is that these countries have never been in Australia's realm and are independent states. The fact is that China and Chinese contractors are the ones who are coming in and actually helping out these countries substantively and offering positive economic solutions for them.


[22-May-21 05:54 PM] Joe1331#8241
Mostly the port of Darwin. the Northern Territory has sold that to China in 2015. 
It's about time we take them back


[22-May-21 05:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
Thank you Joesph


[22-May-21 05:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[22-May-21 05:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
@Gregor The Beggar Gregor, do you feel that China is as much of a threat as people claim it to be?


[22-May-21 05:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
Everyone can we let the Senator answer this


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I do believe that there is a threat in any major superpower trying to economically enter into the Pacific region, especially one which has a poor human rights record and refuses to embrace liberal democracy.


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] Joe1331#8241
It will be Australian if we have that port back to us.


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] NGSpy#8096
Let Gregor answer the question.


[22-May-21 05:56 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
However, I am a pragmatist when it comes to this solution and there is no use pissing ourselves anytime there is the mention of the word China. We need to look at this practically


[22-May-21 05:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*piss is seen coming from @LuSing My Religion*


[22-May-21 05:57 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We export millions to China and our agriculture industry, our mining industry are very reliant on these exports


[22-May-21 05:58 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Quite simply we need to look at our relationship with China as one where a stable trading relationship is a solid backbone. I'm not saying we should be best friends with Beijing or roll over on serious concerns happening domestically in China, I'm saying that not a single party has put forward a package which actually looks at the impacts of their proposals on our trading relationship


[22-May-21 05:58 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Our rural and regional centers are already disadvantaged economically already and a trade war or conflict with any major trading partner will hurt them the most


[22-May-21 05:59 PM] NGSpy#8096
I would suggest to Mr. Caesar to leave the Senator to answer the question before they say something further. I want his insight on this, and then ill address Australia's situation in the pacific.


[22-May-21 05:59 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm more than aware that it is the totalitarian dictatorship but nothing which a bunch of pollies in Canberra will say and do will change it beyond continued investment into our Pacific neighbours to forge a wider Pacific identity where we can economically support each other


[22-May-21 06:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The fact is that change in China will come from within and will come from the Chinese people with the support of the international community


[22-May-21 06:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
We could be exporting wine to China, but under Mikiboss we only ever export *whine* to China. This has to change.

Concerns about Chinese companies purchasing farms is all well and good but we should be worried about massive purchases of our farmlands by any foreign country and by large corporations domestically and overseas. When they send their workers to Australia, they send them with the expectation that they will be abiding by Australian law which the CLP has worked to ensure is implemented on the grassroots level for our migrant population. The export market is something which I fundamentally believe should not be controlled because Australian farmers and Australian exporters know best, I think that your adopting a protectionist model here when free trade will be economically benefitting the grassroots people of Australia.

So, you mentioned that Australia is one of the only liberal democracies in the Pacific and Asian Regions, I believe. Do you feel that Australia should be doing more to assist in the endeavours of other nations in the Pacific and Asian Regions, and what sort of projects would you be willing to implement to ensure more cooperation between Australia and them.

@LuSing My Religion wanna give your thoughts on China as a whole?


[22-May-21 06:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I think it's important to remember that, under Prime Minister Mikiboss, Australia is already a Communist State in much the same way as China. We are, more or less, the kind of dictatorship that China is. We said goodbye to democracy long ago.

We commit some of the worst human rights abuses in the world. Do you know how much tax this Government plans to wring out of small business owners? That, right there, is a human rights abuse that is on par with the situation of Muslims within China. They are effectively subject to the same things.
What are we to do, then? Well, as a sensible party, the Democrats support taking advantage of Australia's natural advantages. In this case, as our Government is basically CCP-lite, we should take advantage of that to get a cushy trade deal with China while we can.

When we have a strong, stable, Democratic Party Government, then we would have to reassess our relations with China. But, for now, we can get some goods for a good price, so let's take advantage of that.

And could I just take a moment to say this: Mikiboss, shame on you for selling Australia down the river to Communism.

Firstly, I'd like to say that while Matthias Caesar talks about helping the Pacific he's done nothing on this while the CLP has stepped up for the Airais, Tokos, Usos, Bradas, M'aaneus and my Taganes across the Pacific Islands.

In regards to trade, an imbalanced trading relationship is always a concern and balancing out that trade is crucial. There is a lot of good markets across the world for our exporters to access and we have been seeing our exporters begin to export all over the world, reducing our reliance on a single partner. However, we cannot deny that China has a massive market for our goods and I refuse to do anything which will not allow for our farmers and rural peoples struggling economically to lose this source of revenue. 

In regards to WHO action in regards to China, any efforts by the Chinese Government to lie to their population or the world about health outcomes in their country must be stopped and efforts taken to vaccinate their population with effective vaccines

Our next question open to all panelists is about the proposal of a CANZUK union.

Do the panelists feel, post-COVID, that this is a union to pursue. I'll start with @LuSing My Religion since she has the most enlightening answers.

Why would we ever want a CANZUK union? What do we have to gain from it? The way I see it, all such a thing would do is tie us to other nations and diminish our sovereignty. I'd certainly welcome closer relations with these nations, but why force ourselves to agree to their rules? We're already under the dictatorship of Mikiboss, why submit to the dictatorship of a foreign boss?

[22-May-21 06:40 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Again, this is another classic case of people talking but no one acting. The Country Labor Party has acted on this field because we were the ones who actually started CANZUK negotiations in the first place. While other parties talked, the CLP were the ones delivering legislation in the House which would have encouraged New Zealand to enter into the first stage of the agreement and begun the process on a strong footing and in fact it was the Australian Democrats, the Nationals and the Liberals who teamed up to vote it down. When it comes to the Pacific, not a single party except for the Country Labor Party actually has a policy on the Pacific Islands Forum and not a single party except the CLP has actually acknowledged it is collapsing and dying. 

The CLP is for CANZUK and for the Pacific Islands Forum to grow and that is because it offers fantastic new trading relationships for our Australian exporters. I'm not so keen on the free movement with CANZUK nations but my stance on free movement in the Pacific is clear as I have long supported extending the same automatic visa rights as New Zealanders receive to the Pacific Islands.


[22-May-21 06:41 PM] NGSpy#8096

[22-May-21 06:47 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
My main concern with free movement is that it is quite simply a step which none of the Government's in these proposed arrangement support. I think that ultimately Australia must maintain a border system and that the current border situation and application process is more than adequate for people to come live and work in Australia. The main area of concern here should be reforming migration laws to make it easier to live here and ending injustice in the migration system before we consider this step which simply is not backed by those in these proposed arrangements.

[22-May-21 06:51 PM] ARichTeaBiscuit#7865
CANZUK is quite an interesting idea in theory, however, I believe it is rather limited in scope. If Australia is going to be involved in a trade deal with members of the Commonwealth then it should also include nations such as India and Kenya.


[22-May-21 06:52 PM] ARichTeaBiscuit#7865

I believe that the past year has showcased the importance of international institutions such as the WHO and I am quite pleased that the Biden administration has taken steps to support the organisation following Trumps attacks on it.

Of course the United Nations isn't perfect and I find the notion of a UN parliament to be quite interesting but it has helped secure peace on this planet since the second world war.

So, there is a criticism of many economists on the WTO: some claim its fine, some claim that its very very favourable to rich countries, and some feel that China has an iron fist grip on it

I've been rather horrified by the violence that has broken out between Israel and Palestine recently. I condemn both the attacks on Israel by Hamas and the attacks by the IDF on Gaza which has seen innocent children killed.

I believe its important for both Israel and Palestine to follow the truce and work together to ensure a continued peace in the region.


[22-May-21 07:23 PM] NGSpy#8096
I thank the foreign minister for their update on the situation.


[22-May-21 07:24 PM] NGSpy#8096
Does anyone else have anything to say or can I move on?


[22-May-21 07:24 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
There is no such thing as an Israel-Palestine Conflict. What there is, however, is an occupying government, an outpost of colonialism and imperialism in the Middle East, that is actively committing ethnic cleansing against an oppressed population.

The policy of Israel is apartheid. It is to murder Palestinians, displace them, and destroy their ancestral homes. 

There can be no two-state solution. There is, effectively, a two-state situation on the ground right now, and what do we see? Regular, routine flare ups of violence when the IDF begin brutal bombing campaigns on an occupied people. The only solution is a multi-ethnic confederation that respects the rights of all peoples in the region.

And as much as we might disagree with the rockets from Hamas, who are we to sit here, in this studio, and pat ourselves on the back for our detached we are? If it were your home being occupied, your family being murdered, your ancestral property being bulldozed, then you'd be angry too. You'd want to see *something* done, *anything* done. So it's a shame that Israel has forced Palestinians into such a corner that their only option is to fire rockets into Occupied Palestine, but our condemnation must remain solidly on Israel, the party responsible for creating and perpetuating this violence.

Final question: Former Prime Minister NGSpy has previously banged on about sovereignty about 'compromised sovereignty' to the United States of America. Is NGSpy a loon or do we feel that Australia has been too reliant on the USA in the past?

I understand that the Presidency of Donald Trunp has showcased that the United States cannot be relied upon entirely, as within their term we saw a ramping up of isolationism and coddling up to dictators.

Australia shouldn't be dependent on the US in such circumstances and should set it's own agenda, on that front I believe the Former Prime Minister is correct.

I would have more respect for the US when they formally apologize and continue to invest in programs which can make up for their horrific nuclear testing in the Pacific particularly in Micronesia

We however do have a good trading relationship with the United States and I believe that should continue and flourish

Hello. I am reminded of a time when a famous New Zealand political operator, Sober_King_Robert, arrived to a debate with National Party MP Winston Wilhemus, and then proceeded to body him -- kicking his ass up and down the stage (rhetorically of course). I suspect this will be similar.


[21-Jun-22 06:02 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Keep in mind of course that SKR was an out and out fascist and yet the majority watching the debate agreed with her. A real testament to her skill with words.

Actually, a late addition has arrived in the form of @ARichTeaBiscuit representing the Country Labor Party. Welcome!


[21-Jun-22 06:03 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

Tonight Australia, you will be able to get a glimpse into the character of each of the candidates for Prime Minister, and that's what I think this election is about: character. Do you want a Prime Minister and a party who were too lazy to have any legislation introduced before the PM asked for parliament to be dissolved? Do you  want a party in charge that tries to jail its opponents days before an election running the justice system? Do you want a party which cannot get anything done? Or do you want a Prime Minister who will stand shoulder to shoulder with you as you face hard times, a man who can relate to your issues, and a man who doesn't switch electorates the night before the campaign? I think the choice is simple.

[21-Jun-22 06:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Australia: You have a choice on Saturday. Yes, you could endorse the rabid dog 12MaxWild, whose largest contribution to the previous term was threatening a foreign head of government and, in the process, committing a serious federal crime. Yes, you could endorse the LNP, who, quite honestly, I don't know enough about to make a pithy line, because quite frankly: who are these clowns?

You could endorse my good friend Gregor_The_Beggar.

Or, you could reelect me as Prime Minister. And if you do, we can get on with the work that started this term. We need an expanded parliamentary team so we can get on with key reforms -- for example, lowering your power prices by reserving a portion of gas for the domestic market -- a policy which Max and the CPA voted AGAINST. That's right, they voted for higher power prices.

Thanks! I think the opening speech delivered by the CPA and the Socialist Party demonstrate the exact reason why they shouldn’t be trusted to lead Australia, as instead of speaking about how they’ll improve outcomes for Australians they devoted most of their time to attacking each other and throwing childish insults.

Meanwhile the Country Labour Party has an actual record of delivering for the Australian people through our work on ensuring rural communities are no longer forgotten and we’ve got an ambitious programme to continue investing in our regions to ensure that Australia can recover from the last term of inactivity and chaos.

Panelists here have mentioned the cost of energy, which is part of the great problem of the cost of living crisis experienced by many around the world. High costs of essentials, rampant inflation, and difficult choices have come about where some looking at choosing between heat and food, even in Australia. I would like to ask each of the panelists, how will they address the cost of living crisis, in particular with energy costs, and since the question specified Max, I will start with him first, followed by ARTB, then the Prime Minister.

Thanks Alan. The Prime Minister managed to pack so many lies into her opening statement, it exceeds the amount of bills submitted by her colleagues in the HoR, but I guess any number is higher than zero. 
The Commonwealth Party has a plan to lower energy prices, we will introduce a temporary windfall tax on the energy companies that are making a fortune out of rising prices, this will force companies to lower prices in order to avoid tax, giving Australians much needed relief on their energy bill. If TSC didn't know about our plan to fix the Winter Crisis then why did her whole party vote for it? The fact of the matter is she doesn't know what's going on with Australians having to either decide between having warmth in their homes or feeding their kids. The first squeak out of the Prime Minister about this Winter Crisis only came after I spoke on the issue which speaks volumes about her character. If she fails to address the issue before we have to point it out to her then she should be sacked.

The CPA's plan to reduce energy prices was voted into passing by a supermajority of parliamentarians. It's the first step in cost of living relief. On the other hand, we have the Prime Minister crying crocodile tears and shouting at me while I try to get work done. I hope she can come to her senses and actually help Aussies instead of making vacuous statements which make no sense whatsoever.

It’s incredibly disappointing that once again we’ve seen the CPA and Socialist representatives squabble like children during this debate and I certainly hope their decorum improves during the debate as Australians deserve better.

In regards to the question, we have seen abject failure of capitalism here as private corporations have risen to exploit the people during a moment of global crisis, of course, a windfall tax is a measure that can help but I think that we can go further.

Personally I look towards Germany as a role model, as on a local level an example being Stadtwerke Munchen which provides public services for Munch, such local ownership of utilities and public services could be a key part of tackling this crisis.

We also need to work closely with trade unions to ensure that our workers are being paid enough and that’s what the Country Labour Party will do

Attacking the SPA too? So much for left unity.


[21-Jun-22 06:31 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
What a joke, really. What's with the CPA and their bizarre fixation with the House of Representatives. Legislation introduced in the Senate, is, newsflash, still legislation! The thousands of Australians who were previously denied Centrelink by a prohibitively high independence age are now able to access welfare, which gives them the hand up they need to get out of poverty, or go to university. That right there is a boon to Aussies suffering a cost of living crisis.

And unlike the CPA, I'm not just going to talk about what I could do. I'm going to talk about what I have done. In the Slater Government and the Gregor Government, I supported greater investment in renewables. The SPA under Drunk_King_Robert and PM Sprinkles supported greater investment. 

Because of that, now, Australians aren't suffering like those in Europe are. The war in Ukraine has caused supply chain disruptions that mean countries can't get access to fossil fuels. Well, in Australia, we generated 80% of our power with renewables! So we no longer have such a need for those fossil fuels! 

I did something about the so-called Winter Crisis when I introduced a regulation that would bring down gas prices for those households that still rely on gas. The CPA voted against it. Now they're trying to privatise QANTAS, and, in doing so, put hundreds of Aussies out of work.

You know what I did? I sat down with the Treasurer -- the CPA Treasurer --  and I told him, point blank, you need to use your powers. QANTAS is under your purview, and I need you to start a hiring spree. International borders are opening and Aussies need jobs. What did the Treasurer do? He sat on his hands. He showed us quite clearly that the CPA aren't concerned with Aussies being in work -- no, they're more concerned with using the proceeds of a QANTAS sale to line their own pockets. 

The SPA will raise wages. We will create jobs. We will rebuild Australia. The CPA just want to tear it down.

[21-Jun-22 06:32 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Thanks for having me on tonight, Alan, I've really missed being with you all.

The LNP has a pretty simply plan for how to combat the issues facing us at this election. We recognise that it has been the socialist government's failure to address any of the issues which are hitting Australians, particularly the poorest and worst off before these crises the worst.

First of all, tax cuts. Keeping more of your own money makes available a considerable new portion of income, even for poor Australians, and we will reduce the amount of money lost to super saving for the period of these crises to further boost this additional income.

Secondly, we're slowing spending. Inflation is a very simply concept - prices rise when the economic system is surged with too much money too soon by government. We're combatting this by reducing spending commitments, bringing the budget back into black, and helping us across the board economically.

Thirdly, interest rates. These are independent of government of course, but the RBA's rate rises are serving to slow down spending - and borrowing - in the economy. These interest rate rises are undesirable for many Australians, but the time of the cheapest money in Australian history  has passed, and our economic recovery depends on it.

The biggest issue facing all Australians is inflation. Our number one concern when we win government is to tackle this head on. Keeping inflation low and manageable is the most important economic issue facing us and it will be our number one issue this election.

Recently, Australia saw an attempt to introduce an Indigenous advisory body to Parliament fail. And that was, quite frankly, a good thing. If politicians want advice from the people they represent, we already have mechanisms in place for them to get that. 

Here's what need: a treaty. A treaty is a necessary step to reconciliation with the Indigenous people of Australia. The treaty process involves sitting down with Indigenous Australians -- all of them, not just the well off professional activists. And when we do this, we listen to them, and we begin the process of healing.

I'm not going to say right now exactly what would be in a treaty. I'm not going to say to Indigenous Australians what they need to heal. We will listen, we will mediate, we will negotiate. 

And beyond that, we will continue with sensible reforms. We will deliver a budget that continues the investment in Indigenous communities that began with the Slater and Gregor Governments. And without a CPA treasurer, that WILL be delivered. We know we can't trust them to! But we can.

Let's stop the lies now. Indigenous Australians were not the first Australians as they tell us. After all, they tell us sovergnity was never ceded. So how they can be the first Australians of a nation they are not a member of which they presumably believe they are at war against is quite the take, even for these intellectual incompetents.

Indigenous Australians are more likely to be arrested because they commit more crimes at every income level; they experience more income inequality because so few of them work while so many of them mooch off the system making them the most expensive racial group in the world. If they want to change their place in this country, first they must recognise that they are a citizen of this country, not merely along for the free gibs. They must look internally to change their cultural issues from within as after over a century of government intervention has done them no good.

There will be no treaty with these hundreds - thousands - of groups of people under an LNP government who show no signs of respect for this great nation; who show no signs of allegiance to this great nation; who show no signs of improving themselves and their communities; who show no signs of anything deserving of recognition.

Aboriginals didn't exist as a nation - they did not even invent the wheel. I hold no animus against these people - we have a civilising mandate to help them - but a treaty which recognises the lie that there was somehow a country here before colonisation is a lie and does nothing to help them.

We must continue to help these people in their communities, they are Australians, but a treaty will not reduce alcoholism, unemployment, abuse, crime, childhood poverty, or any other ill facing these communities

I'll answer the question while the Prime Minister continues to prioritise sledging over actual policy like she did this whole term. If she thinks this issue is so unimportant that she'll eat whle we are discussing it I don't think she should be in a position with the power to enact change.

Alan, indigenous Australians earn on average 33% less than non-indigenous counterparts. This can be attributed to many factors, such as lack of closing the gap policies, rural areas where remote indigenous communities are located not having adequate internet or transport facilities or the repressive big government stopping them from getting ahead.

 Alan, indigenous Australians deserve a better deal from the federal government. As we are by far and away the best country on Earth we should have by far and away the best facilities to let *anyone* get ahead, regardless of their cultural background. 
That's why policies such as the NIT which eliminates bureaucracy and maximises the effectiveness of income support are so crucial to helping indigenous Australians get ahead.

 We know how to deliver, and it doesn't need to involve reaching into your pocket like the left wants to. The Prime Minister can deliver a whole song and dance about a treaty which she promised last election and failed to deliver on but she doesn't have the economic solutions to back it up with.


[21-Jun-22 06:51 PM] ARichTeaBiscuit#7865
Thanks for the question, and I apologise to the Australian people for the immaturity of my colleagues here.

Indigenous people have suffered in Australia for generations, the Country Labour Party has long recognised this tragedy which is why we founded the Aboriginal Education Fund of $500m and brought in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Wardens scheme which creates community policing in the Northern Territory and beyond for aboriginal communities.

Furthermore we support creating a Treaty based on the successful model present in New Zealand which shall greatly strengthen indigenous communities in Australia.

My next question is regarding international relations, which is a function that the federal government only has power over, and hence important for this debate. There has been recent controversy over a CANZIRES Treaty, as well as international relations with countries like Russia and China becoming a hot pot for discussion around the world. What are the party's policies in regards to foreign policy, and how will it affect ordinary Australians? I shall start with @ARichTeaBiscuit , then move on to @12MaxWild , then @My13InchDuck , then a final response from @LuSing My Religion (M: GET TYPING)

Russia’s unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine has certainly risen a lot of questions over Australia’s place in the international community and the role we should play, of course, we should stand with Ukraine during these troubling times but instead of sending lethal assistance to Ukraine I think we should focus on working with our international partners to tackle Ukraine’s external debt as cancelling that would help them more out in the long-term.

In regards to China I believe we need to careful, as it is undeniable that China has a large stake in our economy but we should seek to ensure that that this connection makes us unable to respond to human rights abuses occurring in China, so I support a long-term strategy to grow our connections with regional economies like Vietnam and Indonesia to make us less dependent on China

CANZRIES is also alright in theory but problematic due to issues around Irelands involvement in the European Union, the immediate priority for the CLP is deals with Malaysia and our Pacific Partners and a security deal sign PNG and Singapore.

Ultimately the CLP foreign policy is dedicated to increasing our strength in the region and not hoping for far flung trade deals but the future direction is for the people to decide at the ballot box

Our foreign policy approach is simple: foreign policy should be centred around *foreign policy* not just another way for the socialists to introduce yet more immigration into this country.

Our foreign policy approach is that we support anything that will keep us safer at home and keep our enemies at bay. We support the introduction of ANZUS and CANZUK, recognition that leaving five eyes was a mistake and we need to return to all of these.

Making us non-aligned does not make us safer or any morally better than our enemies - it makes us weaker and more susceptible to our enemies. Peace can only occur through strength, and this government has deliberately and systematically made us weaker in a ploy to placate our enemies in the hope that like the quislings they are, that they are shot last.

 Continuing down this line that these fools want us to would be a mistake with irreversible consequences. China, Russia, and our global enemies are emboldened by our weakness and our allies are disgusted with our unwillingness to fight for our own survival.

Those opposite in government who have done nothing but hurt our interests will tell you that by not being a threat, we can somehow fly under the radar. Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and many more European nations learnt this the hard way. Indeed, previously, we have heard that NATO needs to accept Ukraine to defend Ukraine from Russian aggression. So why does Ukraine get to be militarily aligned but we do not when we have the same enemies?

This government is plainly Australia Last.


[21-Jun-22 07:13 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
The Prime Minister and her party like to talk about violating coalition deals. However, CANZUK was front and centre of our platform and we refused to compromise on our values. The Prime Minister knew this and purposefully screwed up the negotiations, instead the PM and her Socialist cronies decided to make a deal with Ireland and South Africa for god knows what reason. Knowing this, I called a summit with all govt leaders and negotiated a strong CANZUK deal without the PM screwing it up. An aide of mine used my work phone to send a troll message to the NZ PM which I immediatelly rectified by apologising to the PM and immediately terminating that employee. With that being said, the Socialists have decided to be completely deceitful about this and have shown their true tyrannical intentions this term. Accusing me of a crime which carries a jail sentence just two days out of a  campaign is something that you'd expect Maduro to do, but NO! the Socialists, desperate to get above being the least popular party, have attempted a blatantly illegal move. I and the Australian people are disgusted at them/

Alan, CANZUK provides a unique opportunity for Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to strengthen their bonds and honour their shared history by allowing free trade and freedom of movement between each country, sending our economies into the stratosphere. As the Commonwealth Party values deep shared roots and economic prosperity for all we've pursued this publicly enormously popular policy despite the left trying to strike it down so they can do a deal with the authoritarian Chinese regime. 

China has currently imprisoned 2 MILLION Uyghurs in CONCENTRATION CAMPS, AND THE PRIME MINISTER TERMINATED OUR ALLIANCE IN ANZUS TO WORK CLOSER WITH THESE MONSTERS. How in the bloody hell can the Prime Minister say she values morals and respect if she's willing to ignore concentration camps to make a quick deal? The truth of the matter is she doesn't give a rat's arse about morals. She's just interested in winning.

The Commonwealth Party has already reached out to many nations and established diplomatic ties. We are by far and away the only party here tonight that is liked on the international stage, particularly after the ANZUS and CANZIRES debacles. We will restore Australia's place on the world stage and fix our reputation ASAP.

If reelected, we will stay the course on foreign policy. That means we will continue with exactly what we've been doing this term -- realigning Australia so that it can chart its own course.

The LNP and CPA would shackle us to the United States and prevent Australia from having its own foreign policy. We would be forced to follow whatever the little imperialist presidents of the United States decide -- if they want to reduce Tehran to glass, then it doesn't matter how many thousands of Australians die, off we go! Off we go in a war we have no business fighting.

But under the SPA, Australia has its own policy. We are now a proud member of the Non-Aligned Movement, a community of nations that avoids being dragged into pointless wars or meaningless trade fights. No, we stand together as our own nation.

To strengthen our bonds, we would ratify CANZIRES. Once ratified, an Australian farmer could export beautiful, beautiful products such as cotton and beef to the wonderful fields of Canada or South Africa -- and I'm sure Gregor and the CLP will support CANZIRES and support our farmers exporting tariff free to these markets!

Australians will be able to get on a flight and, without any paperwork, go and visit the beautiful cliffs of rainy Ireland, where they can live out their fantasies of pretending they're in Derry Girls. Maybe they'll even run into one of those funny Derry Girls, or the da Gerry! Who knows?

Or perhaps they will visit beautiful Niagara Falls in Canada, the majestic falls, oh how the water flows! 

I'd like to inform the CLP that Ireland already raised issues regarding the EU, and our bureaucrats are working very hard to ensure this treaty has no impact on existing EU agreements.

Let's not forget, of course, that I have already proposed a Pacific Summit, at which Australian representatives will gather together with the leaders of our Pacific community to hammer out an agreement on greater cooperation. If you want practical Foreign Policy, there is

To these accusations I say quite clearly: they are false.

The CPA will throw you and your sons into every meat grinder on Earth for the sake of a one-sided alliance with the US that provides Australia with nothing but dead soldiers.

The one thing I will give the Prime Minister is that foreign wars are not in our interest at all - Tehran, the mecca for NeoCons has nothing to do with us, nor our interests. I promise all Australians tonight, we will not join any American led war unless in self defence. But we cannot let this obscure the facts; America, for all its many ills, is the greatest fighting force in the world. It is therefore in our interest that they are on our side. Leaving any military alliance makes us weaker, even if it attempts to free us from Uncle Sam's hip

CANZRIES is certainly an interesting idea on paper, however, due to the simple fact that the Republic of Ireland can’t sign separate trade agreements as part of the European Union it’s appears to be impossible.

Instead we should be forging closer ties with Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea and our Pacific Partners.

It’s up to the Australian people to decide our direction but under the CLP we will see an Australia with firm economic, cultural and security links with the region, a situation that will deliver jobs and prosperity for countless Australians

My question goes to the Prime Minister. Considering you never introduced a budget, you have left our military entirely without support, being left to wither on the grape vine. You have made our fighting forces weaker, having no capability to defend ourselves. We have no allies to rely on for help in a war which has become more and more inevitable under your leadership. How are we better off today than we were before you took the Prime Ministership?

The initial part of the question is false. The Prime Minister does not introduce a budget -- the Treasurer does. And the CPA's Treasurer sat on his hands and avoided presenting a budget. That's on him and it's on the CPA.

As for the second part, Turkey is more than welcome to call me if Australia is ever invaded by a hostile force. Then perhaps I'll be concerned -- as it stands, all this is is hysterical screaming about the remote possibility of an attack. 

I would tell Turkey that there's a reason why Australia doesn't invest billions of dollars into preparing for a zombie apocalypse, or if dinosaurs show up, or if some godzilla like monster rises from the waves. I suppose they could all happen, but they're not worth worrying about.

Bit thin of a closing remark but oh well. ARichTeaBiscuit, your closing statement.


[21-Jun-22 07:30 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
The election will come down to a few simple issues this weekend. Inflation is rising, your wages are falling, petrol is at record highs, people are having to choose between petrol and grocieries, we have record under employment, a military with no funding, no allies to stand with and a very cold winter approaching.

The LNP has a plan to act on all of this. It is not extreme. It is not crazy. It is commonsense policy. We reutn to our military alliances, we fund our defence, we give the people more of their own monye back, and we tackle inflation. There is no meat on the bones of their policies except to make our country weaker and ashamed of itself. The LNP says no; we are more than this.

Ask yourself one very simple question tonight: are you better off today than you were three months ago?

Return to normalcy. Return to the LNP.

I’d like to thank Alan for hosting this debate and again apologise to the Australian people for the poor conduct of my colleagues here tonight, as not only have we seen constant interruptions but we have seen the LNP delve into far-right rhetoric.

In spite of these interruptions I have strived to put forward the policies of the Country Labour Party, from extending our connections with our regional partners through new economic agreements with Malaysia, supporting our economy through regional-led utilities and  strong trade unions to tackling decades of injustice to indigenous communities through the signing of a new treaty inspired by New Zealand.

It’s been said time and time again but over the next few days you, the Australian people will ultimately have the final decision on the direction you want this country to take, and I hope that you take a look at our record and future promises and vote CLP, thank you,

@LuSing My Religion, you may make your closing remarks


[21-Jun-22 07:37 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well, tonight, the choice was made clear. The LNP sent a representative who, the moment he had the chance, unleashed a torrent of racist abuse that wouldn't be out of place in Apartheid South Africa. He claimed that Aboriginal Australians are simply predisposed to commit crimes, as though there is a little switch in their brains that causes criminality. 

12MaxWild had the opportunity to condemn this. ARichTeaBiscuit took that opportunity I gave and ruled out endorsements or preferences to the LNP. But when Max was given that same chance, he shrank from it, offering a non-answer and refusing to rule out a deal.

And that is why, fundamentally, you cannot vote for 12MaxWild or whichever little racist is in charge of the LNP. The LNP are lunatics, but Max lies down with lunatics. 

Max isn't up here offering policy because he wants to make your life better. He isn't doing it because he knows what it's like to struggle. No, he does this because he thinks it will help him become the Prime Minister. He wants to put the title next to his name. That's all the CPA is anymore -- a vehicle to make him PM and soothe his ego. After all, when RussianHacker delivered the CPA a gangbusters result, Max immediately deposed him. That's just who he is.

They talk about making your lives easier, but they only plan to make them harder. Both the CPA and LNP would rip your children's futures away from you by overturning historic education funding that the SPA delivered two terms ago. They would prevent our Aussie businesses from doing trade with the Pacific or the countries in CANZIRES. They already voted against lowering your power prices!

The Socialist Party will continue to invest. Just recently, all through Victoria, old train stations have reopened and journeys have become easier. That's only because the Socialist Party were there to invest in it. And we will continue to do so. We will deliver infrastructure, health, education.

Australia, this election is a clearer choice than ever. We can choose a party which is all talk and no walk, crying crocodile tears about the issues that affect Australians while proceeding to do nothing. A government which doesn't take responsibility for itself the CPA had to carry it while the Socialists stabbed us in the back. If a party is going to the people saying its achievement as the major governing party was "well we didn't do anything, but we stopped our coalition partners from doing some things" then they are cowards.

The Commonwealth Party is the only party at the podium tonight who has the record to back up our word. Three quarters of legislation this term have been CPA legislation ( hence debunking Trask's weird claim saying they stopped us). The CPA has by far the widest policy platform and by God I intend to deliver on all the promises we make as we did this term. The CPA is only interested in you and delivering material results to you. Australia has had enough of left wing governments letting them down time and again. The SPA have spat in the face of Australians and the CLP have rubbed it in. The PM has been overly aggressive and insulting this whole debate and campaign because she doesn't have anything else to say. She loves to dig up the past and she has no ground to stand on.


Australia, the Commonwealth Party has shown by our candidates in every seat that we haven't forgotten about anyone. The CLP have forgotten about their rural base with no word from Model-Frod or Inadorable on anything. The SPA have betrayed almost everyone at this point, lied to you at every corner and broken every convention in the game to get more power. Their MP for Sydney moved to Perth, their Perth MP to Canberra and their Canberra MP to the senate the night before the campaign beginning in a highly cynical move. CPA candidates are all locals who actually care about you and won't move on next term. Australia, let's vote for hope. Let's vote for change. Let's vote for Australia.

A vote for me and the CPA this election is a vote for Australians. I thank you all for listening me tonight and putting up with my opponents, I hope to win your vote on the campaign trail.
