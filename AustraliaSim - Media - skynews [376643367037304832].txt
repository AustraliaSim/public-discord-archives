By now, you'd all be aware of this ridiculous scandal surrounding me and Nazism


[11-Nov-17 11:36 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I assure you that I did not do a Nazi salute. I said I did in a context which made it clear it was a joke, mocking both the socialists and nazis. Absurdism is a dying comedic art, and it‚Äôs falling away because of the literalism in these thought-police who hate free speech and common sense. I wish to officially condemn nazism, and I wish to make that very clear, and the fact that I even need to say that out loud saddens me.


[11-Nov-17 11:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Mr Bellman, do you regret making the salute and posting it on twitter?


[11-Nov-17 11:37 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Your question is flawed. Please try again.


[11-Nov-17 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Is that a no?


[11-Nov-17 11:40 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
The question is flawed, Mr Journo, as you are *well* aware, given that I just made it *very* clear that I *did not* make a Nazi salute. I will not repeat myself any more. I do not regret making the joke, it has brought this free speech debate to the forefront of discussion in this nation, and if anything I'm glad to be the catalyst of that. Because I can sit here and say Nazism is so ridiculous it's a joke. And the Socialists' reaction to said joke is, well, also absurd to the point that it's laughable.

If you made no salute then why are you defending yourself?


[11-Nov-17 11:42 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
And yes, I feel it is definitely appropriate, especially given that the joke was based around two clear points: how stupid Nazism is, and how stupid socialism is.

The Australian Jewish Council have labelled your post as offensive to Australian Jews and those that fought against Nazis in World War II. What is your response to their claims?


[11-Nov-17 11:46 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm sorry they were offended. The joke was not meant to offend them. Alas, when all the "news" media portray it as such, they are bound to be offended, just as I was personally offended by this mis-reporting. But not as much as I'm offended by socialism, of course.


[11-Nov-17 11:46 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'd suggest the Australian Jewish Council save their offense for actual racism and actual nazism, not some joke which was clearly mocking it as a values system.


[11-Nov-17 11:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
So you are sorry for those that were offended by the post?


[11-Nov-17 11:49 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Absolutely, I don't want people to be offended. But I think an even greater offence to AustraliaSim would be to have free speech removed as an absolute right. Especially when people such as myself use it to mock Nazism, and more importantly, Socialism.

I think that's absolutely ridiculous. My AC was awarded for reasons entirely seperate to policy, not to mention that this ridiculous scandal has entirely to do with me condemning un-Australian values such as Nazism and Socialism. If the Governor-General saw my service as so great to warrant this award, then I see no reason that he would see this single, innocent tweet as enough to completely counter all the other good he saw. I have no doubt that the GG will keep me in the Order of AustraliaSim. If anything I feel I should be elevated to an AK. Nothing more valuable to the Australian way of life than shooting down Nazis and Socialism!


[11-Nov-17 12:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Speaking of which, I now have to get back to doing just that!

Well I was rather confident with a win at the start, which I will admit to. We did lots of campaigning, spoke to much of the constituency, and were recieved well. The team and I got a bit worried after the news of the Aus Party's deal with the Socialists, which I think showed up on those results.


[27-Jan-18 10:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes we will move to the Prime Minister's seat in a moment. Do you expect any more Australian Democrat wins from the remaining seats?


[27-Jan-18 10:29 AM] Perekai#6805

[27-Jan-18 10:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now if we move to your leader for a moment. The Prime Minister has lost his seat, while his chances were tight it is understood the deal between Australia Party and the Socialists to put each other first in both your seat and the PM's helped the Socialists win significantly. Any thoughts on that?


[27-Jan-18 10:35 AM] Perekai#6805
The loss of Lingiari was unfortunate, especially since the Prime Minister had a very close relationship with his voters. As to the Australia Party and the Socialists, I won't deny that politics does require strategy, and sometimes you may have to do unfavourable deals. But I think the Australia Party wagered too much for too little. They wagered their reputation for a seat that they lost. I think they've cemented themselves as dishonest, and that may follow them to the next election.


[27-Jan-18 10:36 AM] Perekai#6805
And their campaign material was rather adamently against the Socialists, so I think it says a lot about their values.

Look it's always hard for incumbents, governments and candidates don't get voted into power they get voted out and we only just lost to the socialists tonight. But our party has not lost its way nor have we moved from what our founding members envisioned when they started this party. I am proud of what the Australian Democrats have achieved over the past two terms of government and am proud to have been a part of that both as the senior minister and as the Prime Minister. We lowered taxes, we created jobs, we begun lowering the deficit and we improved the lives of Australians both in the city and in the bush. And the fight isn't over

The Australian Democrats and Australia Party have announced a merger to now form the Centre Alliance Party. With the aim of the parties to present a united centrist party.

While the two parties used to be at loggerheads with former Prime Minister Bloody Chrome and former Australia Party leader Showstealer at continual loggerheads both inside and outside of Parliament no longer at the helm it appears both parties have been able to settle their differences.

Both former leaders are now Justices at the High Court and it is yet to be seen if they can work together like their former parties.

Clearly no love lost between the Nationals and Forza as Bellman tries to weedle Member for Denison Forza and in return he calls out the former Prime Minister calling him a "deadweight"

Well Australia, its time for my first report!


[13-Apr-18 07:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Tonight, I've broken out my oracle and am predicting the senate


[13-Apr-18 07:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, I must disclaim that this is not easy to predict, because so many voters are unknown


[13-Apr-18 07:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But, lets go ahead anyway!


[13-Apr-18 07:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, my senate predictions are as follows


[13-Apr-18 07:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
First Seat: @deleted-role


[13-Apr-18 07:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Second Seat: @deleted-role


[13-Apr-18 07:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Final Seat: @deleted-role

[13-Apr-18 07:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Hello all and welcome to @Napoleon Freeze unleashed, the show where I get to talk about something.


[14-Apr-18 07:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm going to start tonight by congratulating all those elected to both the House of Reps and the Senate


[14-Apr-18 07:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Special mention to the Pirates who overcame a low first preference and low party modifier to win the final Senate seat on preferances


[14-Apr-18 07:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Thanks to @Ash for that great insight. Tonight, I have two major topics tonight which I wish to explore, the first of which being modifiers.


[14-Apr-18 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I must start by thanking @RunasSudo for running a great election keeping track of all the posts submitted to reddit


[14-Apr-18 07:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, i take issue to the system which we use


[14-Apr-18 07:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For those out of the loop, each candidate got a score for each post they make, then their party also gets a score


[14-Apr-18 07:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
At the end, the two sets are ranked against each other and scores given based on percentiles


[14-Apr-18 07:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For candidates, this system works decently well, as there is a large sample size and spread of data


[14-Apr-18 07:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, it doesn't for parties


[14-Apr-18 07:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Let's look at the final results


[14-Apr-18 07:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The CA and PP put ten posts in, giving a party score of 20


[14-Apr-18 07:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whilst The Libs, Labor and Socs had 11 posts, giving a score of 60


[14-Apr-18 07:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
My issue here, is that one extra post tripled the party score of the latter three


[14-Apr-18 07:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This hurt the chances of the PP and CA candidates of getting the Sim voter in the House of reps, and several for the senate


[14-Apr-18 07:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think that it is unacceptable that a party can be 1 post behind and only get a third of the party score

[14-Apr-18 07:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This needs fixing


[14-Apr-18 07:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I do have a recommendation her9e


[14-Apr-18 07:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
What is needed is a linear distribution


[14-Apr-18 07:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The top score gets 100 points


[14-Apr-18 07:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And then those behind are given points in proportion to the leader


[14-Apr-18 07:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, if the leading party has 11 posts, they get 100 points


[14-Apr-18 07:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If the next party has 10, they get 91 points


[14-Apr-18 07:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Etc


[14-Apr-18 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This is a fairer system for those not in the lead, whilst still punishing those behind


[14-Apr-18 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll now move on to issue number 2

[14-Apr-18 07:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
To explain this, I'm going to use the election in Gorton, which I ran in


[14-Apr-18 07:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Before I do enter This, i must congratulate the liberal party candidate for winning


[14-Apr-18 07:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Nothing I say here should take away from their victory


[14-Apr-18 07:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, i feel that i was shafted by the modifiers system


[14-Apr-18 07:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In that what it stands for was not delivered in Gorton


[14-Apr-18 07:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
During the election, i posted 10 posts to reddit


[14-Apr-18 07:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
My final modifiers score was 111.1


[14-Apr-18 07:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Where as neither of my competition posted to reddit


[14-Apr-18 07:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And their scores were 60 each


[14-Apr-18 07:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now yes, i know that they had a better party score than i


[14-Apr-18 07:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But, the system was designed to stop people from not campaigning


[14-Apr-18 07:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For reference, the Sim voter in question voted for the liberal candidate and then me second


[14-Apr-18 07:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm astounded that someone who doesn't post anything to reddit is still allowed to collect their party modifier


[14-Apr-18 07:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This here is the major flaw to me in this system


[14-Apr-18 07:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That it doesn't even serve it's own purpose


[14-Apr-18 07:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We need to make are requirement to post to reddit to claim party point


[14-Apr-18 07:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Otherwise this issue will plague our nation for long to come


[14-Apr-18 08:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Unfortunately thats all I have time for tonight

Given this, the voting results may have been very different if the switch was made prior to the election


[19-Apr-18 06:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
More now so than ever given the party modifiers attached with the current system


[19-Apr-18 06:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It is my opinion that these MP's should have stayed within their previous party until the next election, when they could announce the move before campaigning starts.


[19-Apr-18 06:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Otherwise, these moves come across to the public as a move spurred on by self gains rather than genuine concerns.


[19-Apr-18 06:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This could be replicated with a minor bonus to all MP's and senators who stay in their party for the entire term that they are in.


[19-Apr-18 06:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Those who do make a switch would lose this benefit.


[19-Apr-18 06:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I myself find it disgusting that such moves can be made so early in the term, but, I respect that what has occured will likely occur for ages to come without some form of deterrent.

Hello, tbyrn!


[21-Apr-18 01:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I‚Äôll start off with a recent poll on Australia Tonight which saw that your constituents would not re-elect you as a socialist. What are your thoughts on this poll?


[21-Apr-18 01:06 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
It has me nervous. After all, up until very recently, Lingiari was a centrist electorate, and it's quite clear of the electoral gains I could make if I left the Socialist Party.


[21-Apr-18 01:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So is there any likelihood that you will leave the Socialists with this information?


[21-Apr-18 01:08 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
It's just one poll, but it does have me worried. I have my doubts, but barring any more Lingiari polls, I will most likely stay Socialist, at least until the next election.


[21-Apr-18 01:09 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I have been thinking about possibly leaving the Socialists in the future.


[21-Apr-18 01:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That must be worrying for your fellow Socialists.

A Socialist government is the most likely thing in my mind, whether headed by someone in Labor, the Pirates or the Socialists.

Not unless they get some defections.

Speaking of that, as a Socialist, how do you feel about your new members joining you?


[21-Apr-18 01:14 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
As a Socialist? Well, obviously, I like it. As myself? I don't think they're doing the proportionality of parliament any favours. It seems as if so close after the election, their intents were clear- they may have been in cahoots with Bsharri before the election, in order to get elected under a moderate banner and defect to the Socialists.


[21-Apr-18 01:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So you think that Bsharri has been pulling some strings?


[21-Apr-18 01:15 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Possibly.


[21-Apr-18 01:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If this were to be true would you still support Bsharri as your leader and senator?


[21-Apr-18 01:16 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
No. In fact, that would be the nail in the coffin for my Socialist Party membership.


[21-Apr-18 01:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If you were to leave, where to next?


[21-Apr-18 01:18 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I honestly don't know. Perhaps I'd become an independent, perhaps I'd go back to my roots in the Centre Alliance, or maybe make an Aboriginal Party to represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.


[21-Apr-18 01:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well, I'm sure that some people would be delighted with that statement.


[21-Apr-18 01:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
On to a less controversial question, what will you do as MP for Lingiari to ensure that your constituents are well looked after?


[21-Apr-18 01:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Frequently consult with them and set up offices across the electorate.


[21-Apr-18 01:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Do you have any bills that you wish to pass to benefit those of the Northern Territory?


[21-Apr-18 01:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I haven't drafted any bills yet, but I do plan to pass bills possibly beginning the process for a treaty.


[21-Apr-18 01:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Do you think that NT should become a state?


[21-Apr-18 01:27 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

GOVERNMENT FORMED

At long last a government has formed with the Socialists and Pirates securing the support of the ALP to form a coalition.

As part of the deal Labor Leader Hoog will be Deputy Prime Minister. There are also suggestions from some punters that part of the deal meant that the Socialists would not run in Whitlam and instead support their major coalition partner.

The news comes as no surprise to many as the party with the largest membership and the largest number of seats after defections was expected to form government

Welcome to yet another episode of @Napoleon Freeze unleashed.


[24-Apr-18 06:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll start off by giving a big crongratulations to all involved in our new government


[24-Apr-18 06:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You obviously worked hard to create a coalition in this turbulent time which we saw after the election.


[24-Apr-18 06:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Especially given the defections and resignations of 3 members.


[24-Apr-18 06:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, these defections obviously didn't affect things too much; those who moved have in effect had the same result as they probably would have been in the coalition regardless.


[24-Apr-18 06:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Even more so when we consider the allegations made by AnswerMeNow in my interview with them on Saturday.


[24-Apr-18 06:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I reached out to Bsharri to get some explanation on those claims,


[24-Apr-18 06:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
he responed by saying it was a 'non-story'.


[24-Apr-18 06:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I find the fact that Bsharri couldn't go into detail or properly deny these claims as suspicious,


[24-Apr-18 06:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and something which should be at least investigated to ensure that nothing illegal has gone on.

Overall very little of actual worth was actually achieved throughout the session.


[30-Apr-18 03:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Speaker, AnswerMeNow still appears to be adjusting to their new role as speaker.


[30-Apr-18 03:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I assume that things will be smoother in that regard in the coming weeks.


[30-Apr-18 03:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The government was asked about the defence budget, with the reply being that plans have been shifted due to the recent crisis in Papua (edited due to my inability to remember how proceedings went).


[30-Apr-18 03:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This was followed with a question related to jobs in South Australia, which was answered by suggesting that new programs will be created to support them by reskilling them into emerging sectors. (also edited)


[30-Apr-18 03:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The member for Sydney was removed for verbally complaining about another members pains too loudly and interruptingly. I expect to see more members removed throughout the election cycle. (also edited due to my incompetency)

A question regarding lowering tariffs was left vaguely unanswered due to the minister still being briefed on their new portfolio.


[30-Apr-18 04:03 PM] Ash#8178
There were also a mass amount of ‚Äúpoint of orders‚Äù


[30-Apr-18 04:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Many of which I found to be just petty squabling


[30-Apr-18 04:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
this then saw an abrupt end to Question Time


[30-Apr-18 04:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
then there was fighting over if they could restart it


[30-Apr-18 04:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
they didn't


[30-Apr-18 04:05 PM] Ash#8178
The first question, asked by the member for Chisholm was ruled out of order


[30-Apr-18 04:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And this brings us to the removal counter


[30-Apr-18 04:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Currently, Madama is the only person on the list, and as such they lead the tally.

Of the 17 electorates, 8 of them have 1 candidate, and one seat has none.

[01-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Canberra: hoogstra:labor:


[01-Jun-18 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So with half the parliament effectively resolved, it looks like this:


[01-Jun-18 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
:liberal: 4
Ind 2
:socialist: 1
:labor: 1


[01-Jun-18 12:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so with those 8 seats plus the unwanted Melbourne, this leaves 8 seats with actual voting


[01-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
These are:


[01-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

and finally Kingston - hk-laichar (aka Polen):CA: v Viado_Celtru:liberal: v PM_ME_SPRINKLES:socialist:


[01-Jun-18 12:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, this means that there is a possibility for:

Welcome back to more election coverage.


[01-Jun-18 04:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll go through the updates which have occured today, as well as make some calls on those seat which have actual votes occuring.


[01-Jun-18 04:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
First, Mad_Bear_O_Melbbourne was relocated to Melbourne, giving the vikings their first seat


[01-Jun-18 04:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
this also gifts n4ziporriidge Bradfield


[01-Jun-18 04:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so, the confirmed seats are now:


[01-Jun-18 04:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
:liberal: 5
Ind 2 
:socialist: 1
:labor: 1
‚öî 1


[01-Jun-18 04:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
now to the seats with contests


[01-Jun-18 04:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
First is Whitlam


[01-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I reckon that the CA candidate will get this provided the Sim Voter goes his way.


[01-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
:CA:


[01-Jun-18 04:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[01-Jun-18 05:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In Greenway I see a couple of Libs, A soc, an ex soc and a memelord


[01-Jun-18 05:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Sim voter will be crucial, but the ex soc and the memelord hold the power.


[01-Jun-18 05:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I feel however that this seat goes to the :socialist:


[01-Jun-18 05:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Pearce


[01-Jun-18 05:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In Pearce I see 1 Soc, 1 CA, another centre leaning (I think) a right leaning and a real unknown.

Batman


[01-Jun-18 06:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Here is a Soc, a Lib and a Lab, plus an unaffiliated. Given that the unaffiliated has a discord pic of fidel castro, I'm assuming that they will vote soc. Thus, this is a :socialist:


[01-Jun-18 06:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Brisbane


[01-Jun-18 06:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
3 candidates, four voters. oh boy


[01-Jun-18 06:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There is 1 soc and 1 viking here, an indy and another memelord. Preferences will be key, as well as the sim voter.


[01-Jun-18 06:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Given that it seems that neither the viking nor soc candidates have much in the way of modifiers, I see the sim voter going Lib, Soc Vik


[01-Jun-18 06:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
which should be enought to see :socialist: win


[01-Jun-18 06:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[01-Jun-18 06:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This just looks like a shambles


[01-Jun-18 06:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
1 soc, 1 CA, 1 indy


[01-Jun-18 06:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
+ 2 unknowns


[01-Jun-18 06:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm calling a narrow :CA: win, but I'm not confident here


[01-Jun-18 06:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[01-Jun-18 06:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
very little info on several candidates here


[01-Jun-18 06:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm going to say :liberal: here


[01-Jun-18 06:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So this gives us


[01-Jun-18 06:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
:liberal: 7
Ind 2 
:socialist: 4
:labor: 1
‚öî 1
:CA: 2


[01-Jun-18 06:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So this means that the Liberals should control the house and would only need the CA or the Indys to form government

In all seriousness


[08-Jun-18 11:06 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
I‚Äôm glad that the Australian people can have a Parliament up and running now, even if my party is in opposition. The actions of the Senate will be very crucial to how successful the Prime Minister-elect is as the leader of the country, because it‚Äôs not going to be an easy time with a minority in the upper house.


[08-Jun-18 11:09 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
I think PineappleCrusher_ was sitting on the Kingston judgement to try and avoid a S&C deal with independents and solely rely on the Centre Alliance to ensure power.


[08-Jun-18 11:09 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Now we have a result, we can get on with things.


[08-Jun-18 11:12 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
If it is a matter of preparing for government by creating bills and trying to create smooth paths for that legislation with certain Senators, what have they been doing in opposition?


[08-Jun-18 11:12 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
I find that a bit concerning that so much election material was put out talking about policy with nothing to put through the Parliament


[08-Jun-18 11:12 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
If that is the case, of course


[08-Jun-18 11:13 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Especially considering that the Liberal Party complained about the lack of a budget, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have one ready to shut us whinging lefties down

Poor politics, I‚Äôd call it


[08-Jun-18 11:16 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Yes I do. Unless they break their promise of cutting health, education and light rail funding for Hobart, I don‚Äôt see why they couldn‚Äôt go full term. The issue will be the Senate - will all the Senators stay blue, especially recent convert Senator NullTheSecond? Probably not.


[08-Jun-18 11:17 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
The Senate is very delicately balanced, and I think PineappleCrusher_ will make a misstep or have issues with some extreme views in his lower house contingent.


[08-Jun-18 11:18 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Disappointing to have a lack of contests for seats. It speaks to an apathy towards politics, perhaps.


[08-Jun-18 11:19 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
The contests we had were earnest and interesting. Pearce turning so harshly against our Deputy Leader was very unfortunate, Drunk_King_Robert is a political figure of the highest esteem. I hope people didn‚Äôt just vote against her for a change of government for the sake of it.

A refocusing of the left forces in public conversation should see voters return to us.


[08-Jun-18 11:22 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
It‚Äôs a swing against us due to the tumultuous end to our term leading up to the election. The manifesto is being updated, however I feel that a reinvigoration of our movement‚Äôs enthusiasm and determination will be more effective than the glossy veneer of a brand revamp. It‚Äôs not congruent with the way we conduct our politics and advocacy, to try and fix things with a coat of paint.


[08-Jun-18 11:23 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Building trust in our current leadership is the most important thing we can do this term.


[08-Jun-18 11:24 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Turning a critical and detailed eye to the potential for destruction the Liberal government presents is the second most important thing.


[08-Jun-18 11:27 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Absolutely. A vote is a vote is a vote. The legislation does not clearly state whether a sim vote is to be worth more or less than any other ballot. Hence, the decision and the new precedent is the only logical conclusion under the current framework.


[08-Jun-18 11:28 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
I think Kingston voters welcome the opportunity to get a Socialist in.


[08-Jun-18 11:30 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
The AEC had their suggested interpretation prior to the decision, and it was found not to be convincing. It‚Äôs not a blight on their conduct of the election, they merely had their conclusions corrected.


[08-Jun-18 11:31 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
I have full faith in the AEC to conduct elections.


[08-Jun-18 11:33 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
We‚Äôre absolutely willing to work with the government to pass a budget. Unfortunately, we know that tax cuts are coming, in a country that has one of the lowest tax burdens of the developed world, so it will be a code for service cuts.


[08-Jun-18 11:34 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
The Liberal Party will have to show a commitment to investing in Australians to get our support.


[08-Jun-18 11:34 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
The Socialist Party will be releasing a costed budget in the coming weeks, with the most ambitious health, education and infrastructure plans this nation has ever seen.


[08-Jun-18 11:35 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
In addition, we want an end to the Direct Action slush fund and an emissions trading scheme to curb carbon emissions, so that‚Äôs a red line PineappleCrusher_has to meet.


[08-Jun-18 11:36 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Our emissions need to be reduced urgently and immediately.


[08-Jun-18 11:36 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Otherwise, we‚Äôre all ears.

[08-Jun-18 11:40 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
And what we achieved


[08-Jun-18 11:42 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
The Net Neutrality Act making it through was incredibly important and I‚Äôm proud of that


[08-Jun-18 11:42 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Workers right to strike is top of the list for things to get through the parliament this term


[08-Jun-18 11:42 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
An emissions trading scheme, something I‚Äôm sure the Liberals will support as free-marketeers


[08-Jun-18 11:43 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
So we can expect some multipartisan support


[08-Jun-18 11:43 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
The last term is done, we are looking forward


[08-Jun-18 11:44 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
We can achieve a lot as an opposition by finding common causes and fighting hard for our constituents to achieve goals they have set for us.


[08-Jun-18 11:44 AM] phyllicanderer#1345

Well folks, its been an interesting period since the last QT.


[26-Jun-18 11:38 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll open with a statement from @Napoleon Freeze;


[26-Jun-18 11:39 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
He says, "I apologise for arriving at Question Time and then not being available shortly thereafter.


[26-Jun-18 11:40 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I would have loved to answer questions during that time; however, I had an unforeseen issue arise, so I had to leave."


[26-Jun-18 11:40 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Interesting Stuff.


[26-Jun-18 11:42 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This week, Deputy Speaker Dyljam took the speakers chair given AMN's current leave.


[26-Jun-18 11:42 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whilst this week still had shenanigans, members were much more well behaved compared to last week.


[26-Jun-18 11:44 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Question Time was opened by Chief Justice DickyKnee, asking for less chaos than last week.


[26-Jun-18 11:44 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
His speech was promptly followed by several points of order. Just like last week.

The Deputy PM was asked a question related to the budget in the PM's absence; however, he was also mysteriously unavailable.

His response was very long, and devolved into an attack on the opposition.


[26-Jun-18 11:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Next, Woof MP asked a question of the opposition regarding education. Bellman complained and was warned.


[26-Jun-18 11:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
After this question too was redirected, Bellman complained again and was removed.


[26-Jun-18 11:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
How Shocking.

Along with several other Liberal Members.

Surprisingly, Woof actually had something relevant to say, asking Ash MP about how he was going to improve living standards in the country.


[26-Jun-18 11:56 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Ash's response said that the government were committed to a better internet for those in rural areas.

with the response reaffirming commitments to the Paris Agreement and then said more will come with the budget.


[26-Jun-18 04:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Tobycool MP was next, asking about increases to agricultural fields, which was responded with a solid yes.

[26-Jun-18 04:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
phylicanderer MP followed, asking about the governments proposed amendments to the Online Gambling Restrictions Bill.


[26-Jun-18 04:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The government was fast to defend the gaming industry developers in their response, which saw the Deputy Prime Minister outcry his disgust at the answer.


[26-Jun-18 04:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The next question again went to the PM, this time from the Viking Party.


[26-Jun-18 04:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It asked about if were there plans to support homeless people better.


[26-Jun-18 04:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The government used this moment to talk about a proposed increase to the tax free threshold, which they claimed would help all people on low incomes.


[26-Jun-18 04:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It was sprinkles MP who had the final question of the day, asking the shadow minister for health, Madama MP, about their thoughts on the current state of the health system.


[26-Jun-18 04:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Madama used this time to have a real stab at the government, claiming that they were failing to support rural healthcare as well as the fact that they are seemingly uninterested that 30% of the population is obese.


[26-Jun-18 04:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There was also a throwaway point regarding the Online Gambling Restriction Bill.


[26-Jun-18 04:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And so ended question time, a session much more successful than last week.


[26-Jun-18 04:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We now go to the removals counter, which stands as follows:

First, the leader of the Viking Party and parliamentarian, Liam, resigned and dissolved the Viking Party as he left, leaving many Viking Party voters unrepresented.


[26-Jun-18 05:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There was then a report on #today-tonight claiming that he had left the country, which was not taken well by those on #direct-action.


[26-Jun-18 05:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Comments were made there which upset the staff at #today-tonight.

Given that Woof is already on thin ice with the High Court, he cannot afford another blow to his public image.

Generally, we actually got some progress compared to the last 2 weeks.


[06-Jul-18 11:18 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Huzzah!


[06-Jul-18 11:19 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This week saw a constant barrage of questions directed to the Prime Minister, and it could be seen that he was actually under pressure throughout.


[06-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
MP for Kingston Sprinkles opened the show with a question asking where the budget was.


[06-Jul-18 11:21 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Prime Minister then blasted Labour for basically backflipping on the last term where they did the same.


[06-Jul-18 11:23 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This was followed with what the Libs had planned in the budget which was due to arrive when the Senate returns.


[06-Jul-18 11:24 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The next question came from MP for Batman Phyllicanderer. They asked if their governments interests were to protect the rich like Gina Rinehardt over regular aussies.


[06-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The PM responded by plugging their new energy scheme, which includes nuclear power.


[06-Jul-18 11:29 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Phyllicanderer followed up their previous question saying why nuclear, to which the PM said because it is best.


[06-Jul-18 11:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It was at this point that chaos started to rain down on Question Time.


[06-Jul-18 11:33 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Opposition Leader Youma asked the PM about the consitutional convention, which the PM briskly brushed aside.


[06-Jul-18 11:35 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There were then four further questions on the issue, which the PM affirmed that he is pro-monarchy and would not let the people have a choice.


[06-Jul-18 11:35 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This caused a ruckus in the house with both sides attacking eachother.


[06-Jul-18 11:37 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Once the commotion ceased, MP for Greenway Ash asked the PM about youth justice and family law.


[06-Jul-18 11:37 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The PM said he was probably not the right person to answer.


[06-Jul-18 11:43 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There was then more squabble over the republic, which was getting petty by this point.


[06-Jul-18 11:43 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Bellman then arrived and lasted 5 minutes before his inevitable ejection.


[06-Jul-18 11:44 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Then it all kinda ended in a wierd chaotic way.


[06-Jul-18 11:45 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This was sadly AMN's last QT as speaker, as they resigned from the speakership earlier this week.


[06-Jul-18 11:46 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway that brings us onto our dismissal tracker!


[06-Jul-18 11:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And Bellman makes it 3 from 3 with surely a record 5 minutes between his entry and removal.

The most interesting piece was that the Attorney-General will be told to start work on a referendum for a republic.


[09-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But even then that was already likely to occur anyhow.


[09-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

This is a worrying sign for the Government, as the opposition has a clear majority in first preferences.


[13-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And this flows through to the Senate Distributions.


[13-Jul-18 07:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Labour will retain their 2 seats.


[13-Jul-18 07:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Libs will hold one and maybe keep their second.


[13-Jul-18 07:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If they do lose one, then the CA holds their seat.


[13-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In either scenario, the Greens gain that seat.


[13-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
With the government's majority under threat on both fronts tomorrow, things could get ugly, fast.

[16-Jul-18 03:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The CA lose their seat after Deladi0 was removed from the vote, and that goes to the Libs.


[16-Jul-18 03:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Then Labour lose one of their seats to Independent @ChairmanMeeseeks


[16-Jul-18 03:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This was basically a polar opposite of the polling which saw the opposition likely to gain the balance of power in the Senate.


[16-Jul-18 03:47 PM] Deleted User#0000

obviously with the CA preferences going striaght to the libs, this may be a bit inflated


[16-Jul-18 03:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'd rather think that the labour seat went to Meeseeks


[16-Jul-18 03:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and that the CA spot went to the Libs


[16-Jul-18 03:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Do you think that the Joint Labour/Green ticket hurt their chances?


[16-Jul-18 04:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Is it possible that the left votes were split with some voting below the line to put Labour above the greens, with others voting above?


[16-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Ash#8178
I think the two caucuses are still quite divided


[16-Jul-18 04:02 PM] Ash#8178
God knows why they did a joint ticket


[16-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For example I know that the CA were asking their members to vote below the line to put the greens above Labour,


[16-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
granted that most of those votes went to the Libs anyhow


[16-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Tonight, I'm going to shed some light on an issue which I have been thinking a lot about recently.


[23-Jul-18 06:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Its not a major issue, but we do need to talk about it.


[23-Jul-18 06:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I want to talk about Parliament, and how we elect members to it.


[23-Jul-18 06:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As many of you would be aware, we have two houses at present; the house of representatives, and the senate.


[23-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Members elected to the House of Reps get in by being elected from their ranges, whilst the senate takes the top candidates from the whole country.


[23-Jul-18 06:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There are normal, real voters, as well as the simulated voters.


[23-Jul-18 06:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I have a full argument to propose for you tonight.


[23-Jul-18 06:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

I'm going to start by looking at the motives behind why we introduced the sim voter.

{Reactions}
ü§ñ (2) 

[23-Jul-18 06:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Regular viewers would be aware of my opinions on the matter; although I have come to have a better opinion on them.


[23-Jul-18 06:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They were introduced to bring a reason to campaign to voters, to encourage activity, and to prop up voter counts.


[23-Jul-18 06:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I can see that they certainly have helped with these reasons, but I feel they could be better utilised.


[23-Jul-18 06:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If we look at the previous elections, several divisions have had seriously low turnout,  even as low as one physical vote, plus the sim vote.


[23-Jul-18 06:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In these cases the sim vote has caused a tie which leads to another, costly by-election.


[23-Jul-18 06:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In other cases, it breaks a 1-1 tie.


[23-Jul-18 06:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, we can see that it is representing a large portion of the vote, due to low turnout.


[23-Jul-18 06:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll admit that the sim voter helps in ensuring that the only candidates that get in are decent, but I think we can all agree that it isn't much of an election with such a low turnout.


[23-Jul-18 06:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So why is turnout so low?

{Reactions}

[23-Jul-18 06:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well, turnout is often around 60-80%.

üíØ (2) 

[23-Jul-18 06:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well, the answer is simple; there are usually only 4 or 5 voters registered.

{Reactions}
ü§ó (2) 

[23-Jul-18 06:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As such, results are less about campaigning you ideas, but hoping that your voters exist and vote, as well as not being alts.


[23-Jul-18 06:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So whilst turnout is ok, the effects of it are reverberated by having a high count of divisions and thus a low population count in each division.


[23-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, the Senate results are usually fairer and are more representative of the electorate.


[23-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Usually.


[23-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yet if we look at the senate, we can see that apart from elect their president, the Senate has done basically nothing since the April elections.


[23-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As such, no bill has passed parliament, since April

[23-Jul-18 07:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

This is about the same number of members and senators combined.

ü¶ë (4) 

[23-Jul-18 07:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This would then lead to actual elections where there are several voters per division who will acutally show up, plus the simmed voters.


[23-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This I feel would be a better system where people have to work to get in, and fight against other parties to get in.


[23-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
rather than the lotteries we have right now.


[23-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm not saying that this is the answer to our prayers, but it is something for both parliament and @RunasSudo to consider.


[23-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I do feel that this will be better than a fully simmed system, without keeping the current system which we can mostly agree needs change soon.


[23-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Maybe we can implement it as part of the referendum for a republic?

[25-Jul-18 03:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and we need to stop that.


[25-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm not sure how that would occur, but the people in those affected regions best be ready for pollie overload.


[25-Jul-18 03:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In other news, there has been a dispute between Chief Justice Dicky_Knee, and Justice General Rommel.


[25-Jul-18 03:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This has drawn the attention of Parliament, who are debating a motion regarding it presently.


[25-Jul-18 03:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I feel that if two of our nations leading legal members cannot settle a dispute themselves, how can they solve other people's disputes, let alone disputes of a legal nature?


[25-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I won't go into details about their issues as it is a personal matter, but it is going to affect their decision making somewhat in my opinion.


[25-Jul-18 03:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyhow, thats all I have time for today, thanks for tuning in.

We have an anonymous source with news regarding Senator Viado Celtru


[29-Jul-18 05:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They claim that the Senator has come down with a life-threatening illness


[29-Jul-18 05:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and will be resigning politics very, very soon.


[29-Jul-18 05:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The source could not confirm if this is related to the expected statement from the PM regarding the budget


[29-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but did state that former MP Tobycool1_1 looks set to take the senate seat and minstry which will be left by Viado

Next up was the deputy Prime Minister asking CommanderMeeseeks how he planned to use his new roles.


[29-Jul-18 06:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Which they outlined.


[29-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The DPM continued by asking the Leader of the Opposition if they had any bills coming, to which the response outlined that a few were in the early stages of drafting.


[29-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Next up, the speaker wanted to ask a question, but the house said no.


[29-Jul-18 06:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Oh how the turntables have turntabled.


[29-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This moment did create a new acronym, the LotO, or Leader of the Opposition.


[29-Jul-18 06:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
#MakeLotOTheOneAcronym


[29-Jul-18 06:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There then was a back and forth between the LotO and DPM where various questions were asked.


[29-Jul-18 06:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
After this, the LotO asked the PM if they would field any candidates in the By-Elections, which the PM said yes to.


[29-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The LotO continued, asking the Member for Greenway when the house committee would be establised.


[29-Jul-18 06:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
He said it was coming very soon.


[29-Jul-18 06:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Member for Denison followed by asking about the budget, to which the PM said that an announcement would be made.


[29-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Question Time then concluded, and Balance was restored to Parliament.


[29-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
No changes to the Dismissal Counter this week, but Bellman still leads that tally.


[29-Jul-18 06:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I've heard that the TAB are reoffering their $1.75 on Bellman to be at the top when Parliament ends.

[03-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So this most closely aligns to your political beliefs at this point in time?


[03-Aug-18 07:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Those are some very bold claims you have there.


[03-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Prime Minister claims he has proof to expose you as a snake. How do you respond to that?


[03-Aug-18 07:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Given that you we're one of the main members writing it, how much of it was completed befor eyou left?


[03-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So a vast majority?


[03-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so would you call it say, 80% complete?

Ok, I'll say that it isn't finished. Is there more which you could have done during your time to get it done faster?


[03-Aug-18 07:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so you are saying that all the time you reasonably could, you spend on the budget


[03-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Had you stayed on, when would you have gotten it finished?


[03-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[03-Aug-18 07:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Thanks. On to a better topic now, what do you hope to achieve at Labour?


[03-Aug-18 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If your ban ends before the next election, will you stand?


[03-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Which house would you likely request?


[03-Aug-18 07:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, seeing as you left the Liberals, do you have any reccomendations for them or final words to say to some of your former colleagues?

[13-Aug-18 08:39 PM] waltor#3519
Well if they boycott it of course they're not going to get an accurate result.


[13-Aug-18 08:39 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The #australia-tonight, assuming the last one I saw is the one you are referencing which, by the sound of it, it is...


[13-Aug-18 08:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I really do not mind boycotts. In fact, I'm a massive fan of boycotts. It's the consumer, the public, taking responsibility for their own world.


[13-Aug-18 08:41 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
In this specific case, they either don't like the journalistic standards over at #australia-tonight, which I'd believe, given that it is hosted by Greens and Labourites, although personally I think they do a fine job, I don't think it is a stretch for any one to imagine that this might be the case.


[13-Aug-18 08:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm not convinced that it is out of fear for the real result, although that is a possibility...


[13-Aug-18 08:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
If you want my professional opinion, this is a publicity stunt. They weren't likely to do well on the poll, and I don't think that that necessarily reflects on their actual popularity in the nation, but definitely on the active population.


[13-Aug-18 08:43 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The Liberal party are operating with a silent majority, I believe.

[13-Aug-18 08:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
They could easily explain a poll this way. But a boycott attracts publicity, media talk, as we are doing right now, and in fact balances the argument.


[13-Aug-18 08:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's a much more reasonable argument from the Liberals perspective to have "we boycotted you" vs "you are scared of the results" than it would be "we have a silent majority" vs "you got blown out in the poll".


[13-Aug-18 08:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Anyway, I think it's at the very least good strategy, and I expect nothing less from the PM. He was trained by the best, after all... *pats self on back*

The Seven Wonders of Socialism
1. Everybody is employed.
2. Although everybody is employed, nobody works
3. Although nobody works, everybody fulfills the plan.
4. Although everybody fulfills the plan, there are no goods.
5. Although there are no goods, everybody has everything.
6. Although everybody has everything, everybody steals.
7. Although everybody steals, nothing is ever missing.

[23-Aug-18 07:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yay!


[23-Aug-18 07:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This week's QT started half an hour late


[23-Aug-18 07:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
which wasn't great


[23-Aug-18 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Bellman immediately started by getting angry at the stand in speaker AshMP for editing the hansard


[23-Aug-18 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Dyljam the Member for Denison asked the first question, to the Minister for Education.


[23-Aug-18 07:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
He asked if priority would be given to local students over international students for tertiary education.


[23-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
After AshMP called the wrong person Bellman pressured him into vacating the chair.


[23-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Dyljam then took the chair and called the correct person, Minister scrubfungen


[23-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Deputy Prime Minister then rose to ask the Member for Denison if he would apologise to the community for failing to remain independent for the full term. This started a debate over if the speaker could answer questions.


[23-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For the moment, this question was brushed aside.


[23-Aug-18 07:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Bellman got himself ejected for not the first time this term.


[23-Aug-18 07:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Senator DKR asked the PM if he was proud of his senators.


[23-Aug-18 07:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The PM then reminded the senator that those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones


[23-Aug-18 07:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Senator Chairman Meeseeks then joined Bellman on this weeks list of Ejectees.


[23-Aug-18 07:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
After much back and forth, the Member for Denison answered the Question from the DPM, where he stood his ground and stated that he had not lied to his constituants.


[23-Aug-18 07:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This started a fierce debate between the two and was the main focal point of Question Time.


[23-Aug-18 08:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Several questions would be asked between the two and both sides refused to give in.


[23-Aug-18 08:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
tbyrn21 claimed that Dyljam had betrayed his voters, whilst Dyljam responded by saying that tbyrn21 and the Centre Alliance had broken their own promises and was just another part of the Liberal Party.

{Reactions}
üíØ üòÆ 

[23-Aug-18 08:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
One such moment included when Dyljam asked if the DPM had broken the promise to get a referendum on the republic.


[23-Aug-18 08:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
tbyrn21 took this opportunity to blast his counterpart by saying he and his party never promised it or wanted it, and that he was doing it as a part of his role as Attorney-General.


[23-Aug-18 08:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In amongst this, the PM was asked about a possible cabinet reshuffle, and the LotO asked a question each to both Dyljam and tbyrn21.


[23-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Dyljam was asked about if he would remain in S&C with the government, to which he said yes.


[23-Aug-18 08:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Then tbyrn21 was asked about his opinions on his parties future.


[23-Aug-18 08:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
tbyrn21 took this time to blast the newly formed parties for dividing the Centre, and said that all the parties in that region would fall like dominoes.


[23-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The PM was upset that he wasn't given the call, so stormed out of QT, leaving tbyrn21 in charge.


[23-Aug-18 08:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The LotO asked various people about giving the rights for the territories to legislate on euthenasia


[23-Aug-18 08:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The deputy Prime Minister then revealed a very controversial opinion after being asked about prisoner rights, believing that they should not be given the right to vote.

Polls for the by-elections in Lingiari and Pearce are now closed and vote counters are busy tallying up the cast votes. Stay tuned for live results as they happen.

Whilst we wait for results, I'd like to host Aussimvision soon. Nominations will close at three for the event to occur shortly after.

Hello Everyone!


[26-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It is time for the first ever AussimVision!


[26-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We have 6 fantastic songs today, and I don't have a clue who will win.


[26-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Before we begin the music, a quick explanation of the points scoring system


[26-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Each performer will rank their songs in order of preference.


[26-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Their favourite song earns 12 points. Their second favourite earns 10, then 8 7 6 5 and so on such that their top 10 songs earn points.


[26-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As you'd be aware however, we don't have more than 10 songs.


[26-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But, the points system remains the same.


[26-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You cannot vote for your own song.

[27-Aug-18 03:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There is a new rule, which will apply to *almost* all rounds going forward: songs that have been in a previous AussimVision cannot be in another.

during the break I have received a leak from a different person refuting the claim about Monti not having support of his faction.

I eagerly await those results to see who was right.


[05-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Joining me in the studio now to talk about this is @Youmaton. Welcome on the show!


[05-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Youmaton#1190
Thanks for having me on


[05-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
no worries


[05-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
before I chat to you I have had my second source clarify that they were refuting a different part of the initial story


[05-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I will bring those details when they provide them


[05-Sep-18 06:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So Youma, you were unopposed in the spill. WHat does that mean for the various Labour Members of the country?


[05-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Youmaton#1190
Before I answer that, may I clarify aspects of your earlier claims?


[05-Sep-18 06:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
go ahead


[05-Sep-18 06:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
This vote was called by me under section 13(b)(i) of the Labour Constitution. I called it after having had talks with Hoog, and him agreeing that we needed an active deputy leader. He stood aside. Gredsen and Matt were the only ones to nominate for the position of Deputy, and the vote is ongoing.


[05-Sep-18 06:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Thank you for that detail


[05-Sep-18 06:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, what does your reelection as Labour Leader mean for your supporters?


[05-Sep-18 06:10 PM] Youmaton#1190
It means we are unified. All members support me as Leader, which im very humbled by. Labour is a party that works together to ensure that the country is put first. Labour supporters can be certain that we have their interests in mind, we are here for you and will stand up for you all the way.


[05-Sep-18 06:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
With the election looming, how does it feel to know that you have full party support?


[05-Sep-18 06:11 PM] Youmaton#1190
Its reassuring. It means we can focus on our objective, we can focus on winning the election so that the Australian people can prosper.


[05-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We know that the events that eventually led to the calling of the election started with the voting down of the Online Gambling Restriction Bill 2018. Do you have any comments about the chain of events that ensued, including the dramatic exit of the CA from the Government and the following war of words between them and the Liberals?


[05-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Youmaton#1190
Im honestly surprised. Through some communications, I knew that CA were not happy that the Liberals had voted down the bill, but I dont believe that anyone couldve predicted that they were going to quit the government and vote yes to a vote of no confidence.


[05-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Youmaton#1190

[05-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Youmaton#1190

[05-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yes the vote was quite convincing


[05-Sep-18 06:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now that the CA have an, interesting, relationship with the Liberals, would you consider working with them in the possible event of a hung parliament?

[05-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Youmaton#1190
I wouldnt say no, however I would prefer if they had a better environmental policy. Labour is open to negotiations with *most* parties.


[05-Sep-18 06:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think we know who you wouldn't work with


[05-Sep-18 06:24 PM] Youmaton#1190
Indeed.


[05-Sep-18 06:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
One last question before we wrap this up, who is your hot tip for the next Deputy Leader of the Labour Party? Whos gonna get it


[05-Sep-18 06:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
I do know the standings at the moment, but ill keep it a surprise for 5:20pm tomorrow.


[05-Sep-18 06:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well there you have it folks, we have no idea who is winning the race.

[08-Sep-18 08:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
" The party stands for some very backwards values, in my opinion, and is quite hypocritical in my views. They argue for liberalism yet dislike unions and a variety of free bodies. They dislike non-traditional marriage, yet argue for libertarian policies. My biggest grip with the conservative ideology is that it is not consistent, instead to hangs onto bleak politics which is rooted in prejudice and religion, not modern, dynamic discussion."

[13-Sep-18 05:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So Labour will gain one seat, but fall short of the majority


[13-Sep-18 05:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For reference, purple is the UDP


[13-Sep-18 05:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So Labour will have a big bloc, but no leader to lead them, whilst the Centre and the Right is a bit of a shambles.


[13-Sep-18 05:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For reference, all my calls sortof exclude the sim voters, and assume 100% turnout


[13-Sep-18 05:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
which we all know won't occur

@adamtad asks for my future predictions and how each government pans out


[14-Sep-18 06:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well, I think there are two likely situations


[14-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the first is a giant coalition of the Centre three (CA, UDP and Reason) with S&C from the Libs, or Labour, possibly with one of the Centre three and or the greens.


[14-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If labour has government it would possibly be the stabler of the two


[14-Sep-18 06:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
as they would be in one party, not three or four


[14-Sep-18 06:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If Labour is in opposition, then it is likely that a lot of negotiation will go on within the government to get bills through

@Youmaton asks why I'm so confident that I'll win tomorrow

While negotiations have been reported to be underway and rumours hace floated around with even a Liberal-Labour Coalition floated the UDP leader and recently elected member for Sydney has not been seen much. The former Primer Minister has not returned any calls made by SkyNews with one report of hin sighted at Pharmacy Guild House in Canberra where the Ex-PM club recently moved into calls to them were met with refusal to confirm members or guests in attendance. 

Meanwhile the gates at Yurramulla remain closed with the press pack that has been camped outside for two days remain waiting and watching.

Only moments ago BloodyChrome drove out of the gates of Government House after swearing in as Prime Minister. The Centre Bloc has joined forced with the Liberal Party to form government with BloodyChrome becoming Prime Minister for a second time. and has called for the parliament to now right the wrongs of the past and get back on with the job of improving the country. The government's detractors are already calling it the Coalition of Chaos with newly installed Deputy Leader of the Labour Party leading the charge.

Welcome folks,


[16-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This is the show where we give you the answers, and you give us the question!


[16-Oct-18 08:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the rules are as follows


[16-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
there will be a board on screen with 6 categories, each with 5 clues of different values


[16-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
you pick a category and price, and we give the clue


[16-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
first person to buzz in, by piping (which is this . ) gets the right to answer


[16-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
that answer must be in a question


[16-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
get it right, you get that amount


[16-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
get it wrong, you lose that amount

[16-Oct-18 08:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
for those questions, you set the amount


[16-Oct-18 08:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
upto your current balance, or the original amount of the clue

We have news coming out of the government tonight


[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That is that the CA are not recontesting Canberra even though they won it at the last election


[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and that instead the Liberals will field a candidate


[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They have chosen controversial figure Woof


[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
to fill that role


[19-Oct-18 07:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It will be interesting to see what the voter reaction is


[19-Oct-18 07:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
this is a big shift from the centrist candidate that stood for the area last term


[19-Oct-18 07:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
however if the government wins this seat, it will technically be a gain after stalinomics left the government to be an independent


[19-Oct-18 07:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
meaning that there will be 3, possibly 4 depending on tomorrows by-election, MPs of the opposition


[19-Oct-18 07:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the left have completely collapsed this term


[19-Oct-18 07:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and it all started when Labour lost Whitlam

[19-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I won't say that the right or centre have done a fantastic job


[19-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the government has managed things nicely


[19-Oct-18 07:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but the opposition have collapsed in upon themselves


[19-Oct-18 07:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and it is reflecting poorly upon them


[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
provided there is government co-operation, they can quite easily pass whatever legislation they want now


[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
they have a huge majority in the House


[19-Oct-18 07:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and a majority in the senate


[19-Oct-18 07:30 PM] Ash#8178
Well it‚Äôs basically a majority in the senate


[19-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

whilst I have you here, is there anything you would like to say to the voters in the upcoming by-elections to woo voters back to the left


[19-Oct-18 07:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
@Youmaton


[19-Oct-18 07:48 PM] Youmaton#1190
All I can say to the voters is to vote on policy. Vote on parties that will deliver for the future, not for short term gain. Dont vote for coal authoritarians or un democratic parties, dont vote for parties with puppets for leaders, vote for parties that stand up for you and your rights. Vote for parties that have an actual climate policy, and want to see our nations future be bright instead of under water.


[19-Oct-18 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well I thank you for coming on the show tonight Youma, I wish you and your party well for the future.

This week, the songs must be specifically made for, and appear in, a movie.

It is similar to the game round, but the song must have been made for the movie.

since we have a few newcomers this week


[01-Nov-18 06:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
when voting, you submit a top ten list of the other songs


[01-Nov-18 06:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
if there is less than ten competitors, then that is fine, just rank all other songs


[01-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
if there is more than ten, then those outside the top ten are given no points

To explain, lets dissect my campaign last term


[12-Nov-18 10:07 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I campaigned a lot in Queensland


[12-Nov-18 10:07 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
its my home state, and I know a lot about it


[12-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but what I didn't do


[12-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
was campaign in Whitlam


[12-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the seat I have

[12-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Under the current system, this is fine


[12-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so long as I post 100+ words a day I maximise my modifiers


[12-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
(well, those available from adverts)


[12-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so if I post 100 words which construe sentences it doesn't *really* matter what they say


[12-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I could campaign one day on tax is theft

[12-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it wouldn't matter


[12-Nov-18 10:11 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so long as I post 100+ words


[12-Nov-18 10:11 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now yes, I could turn off humans,


[12-Nov-18 10:11 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but how many of them would swing anyways


[12-Nov-18 10:12 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now I am not saying that big campaign = win the seat


[12-Nov-18 10:12 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
that then removes the need for people to begin with


[12-Nov-18 10:12 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but campaigns must surely be relevant to the election


[12-Nov-18 10:13 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
A campaign based in Hobart should be meaningless to someone in Cairns


[12-Nov-18 10:14 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now for many months I have opposed fully simmed


[12-Nov-18 10:14 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

We say that each seat has 1,000,000 voters

that's a bit low, but it will do for math purposes

{Reactions}
Dicky 

[12-Nov-18 10:17 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
each human is worth such that 500,000 voters are human


[12-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
IE: if I am in a seat of 5 humans, my vote is worth 100,000


[12-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
those 500,000 other voters are based off of the modifiers system

{Reactions}
pip 

[12-Nov-18 10:19 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
we replace the current campaign criteria to be about being relevant to location, post effort, and reasonableness of the proposals and promises


[12-Nov-18 10:20 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For example, a promise to voters in Alice Springs to upgrade the gold coast light rail should be meaningless


[12-Nov-18 10:20 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but a promise to help farmers will be liked in a rural seat


[12-Nov-18 10:21 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
To aid this, we need to formalise the map of Aussim's electorates


[12-Nov-18 10:21 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
we need to know what suburb is in each seat


[12-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
then we can do a proper localised campaign


[12-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
having a larger number also allows better representation of the minor parties


[12-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
they can still get 20,000 voters


[12-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
rather than 0


[12-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Fully simmed is not the answer

{Reactions}
hearhear 

[12-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but 50/50 might be


[12-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
also 50/50 is the max allowed by the meta constitution


[12-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so unless you want a big referendum


[12-Nov-18 10:24 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
no fully simmed.

they are here to do politics


[12-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and campaigns are part of that


[12-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
maybe its because they are confused?


[12-Nov-18 10:28 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
idk

DKR asks what parliament would be like under fully simmed


[12-Nov-18 10:28 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well that's a toughie


[12-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'd hope that regional preference is taken into account


[12-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
ie: Mayo elects a more centrist candidate


[12-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but the Libs would have to get their heads out of their arses to stay in parliament


[12-Nov-18 10:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
umatbru would be long gone


[12-Nov-18 10:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
along with a few others


[12-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I wish though that the system would take into account political climate


[12-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Like, except for Melbourne, the far left candidates we see here would have little to no hope


[12-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I don't mean to be nasty against those folks


[12-Nov-18 10:32 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but comparing between Aussim and irl, Aussim is very left in comparison


[12-Nov-18 10:33 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Youma points out something I missed but also has been bugging me, and that is that we wont MP's seat hopping to stay in power


[12-Nov-18 10:33 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I was lucky enough to stay in Whitlam


[12-Nov-18 10:33 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but I wouldn't have if the seat had different voters.


[12-Nov-18 10:35 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Sprinkles also notes that incumbents actually can do well


[12-Nov-18 10:35 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so that's good


[12-Nov-18 10:40 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
DKR mentioned the greyhounds


[12-Nov-18 10:40 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There is no reprocussion for doing something major


[12-Nov-18 10:40 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
ie: PC's meme motion will go unpunished except for the condemning


[12-Nov-18 10:41 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
there is no political reprocussions


[12-Nov-18 10:41 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Or FUIC wouldn't be an issue


[12-Nov-18 10:42 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So things like bad political stunts also needs to be modelled in as a negative

If you calculated this out, it would likely be Reason v SocDem

what this survey did not take, was Ash v Youma, or NKG v Youma, which may have produced different results

we have 1 contestant


[19-Nov-18 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
for reference the way its going to work won't require being all online at the same time


[20-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll explain a bit more what this will be


[20-Nov-18 12:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
A leg will encompass a couple of challenges and travel between.


[20-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
A challenge might be to answer a few questions


[20-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For example, a maths question


[20-Nov-18 12:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
if you get it wrong, you will keep guessing till you get it correct


[20-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but each failed answer will lead to a slower time through the challenge


[20-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
travel will be where you send me the route you wish to take


[20-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
with screencaps to show what you are saying


[20-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
you need to show what path, as well as what mode of transport, whether you hail a cab, take public transport or walk through a city, or what flight you take


[20-Nov-18 12:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
using transport won't be free, so you'll also have to manage your money, which will be given to you throughout the race.


[20-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the last person to reach the pitstop may be eliminated


[20-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the pitstop is the final point in a leg

The Prime Minister has just introduced the budget to the house on behalf of the Treasurer.

Key points: a $100/week increase to Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients. An imposition of a tax on capital gains offset, establishment of a Youth Suicide Taskforce, a surplus of $4.3B

>I am here once again to voice my displeasure of the failure of my bill. I am outraged that it has been rejected by such a large margin.
I have been receiving many calls from electors who are disgusted by the actions of parliament and have called on me to take action. And that I am doing right now.
I've had enough of this government. I have been supporting the Liberals for a long time on various issues, and the one time I ask for something back, they can't even do that.
When you have a one seat majority, the last thing you should be doing is upsetting your coalition colleagues, and I can't believe I'm saying this but this government can't even manage that. 
As such I and the rest of the CA will be leaving the Government and heading to the crossbench. I am also resigning from my positions as Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney General and Minister for Justice.

No, not really. However as the new Deputy Leader I am willing to work with him and put my personal views aside and move the Liberal Party forward.


[14-Dec-18 06:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So seeing as though you are the new Deputy Leader, what do you want to bring to the table and how will you negotiate it's success with your new leader?


[14-Dec-18 06:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well as a member of what some call the ‚Äúhard-right‚Äù I want to bring back the traditional conservative values of the party and move AusSim away from the cultural Marxism and rubbish socialists that threaten everyday life.

In polls from previous elections, we saw a similar narrative with poll results for Youmaton.

They typically saw these big blocks of support, however the left coalition as you would know outright lost the September 2018 election despite it looking bright for them.

But, there is still significant support for the centrist parties of the UDP and CA where the UDP are the primary party in government at the moment.


[19-Dec-18 05:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
There is obviously still the same precedent that could occur with the left wing support ending up not resulting in an election win, but we shall wait and see.


[19-Dec-18 05:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
The left has been seen also to brigade a fair bit on these polls, so the result can also have the chance of bias.

looking at things, I'm guessing DSaiyan and DKR get the sim votes (1 each)


[21-Dec-18 11:03 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Monti gets 1 real vote

oof (2) radical aye 

[21-Dec-18 11:03 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
DS gets 3 real votes


[21-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
BJiO gets 2 real votes


[21-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
then theres 1 vote which I'm not sure of


[21-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
lets assume full turnout


[21-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
that vote will end up on the left most likely


[21-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm guessing DKR will overcome monti


[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so monti is excluded


[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
dkr now on 3


[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
BJiO is next lowest


[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
those votes go to DS


[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so DS wins 5-3 2PP against Labour


[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
theres so many factors at play here


[21-Dec-18 11:05 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm not confident but the call is udp.

This one will come down to modifiers


[21-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
if Silcon can get them both, which is possible but unlikely, then he'll tie the vote


[21-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and win on the tiebreaker


[21-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but I think the sim vote will split


[21-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
which hands the win to the radicals


[21-Dec-18 11:09 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
its close enough for doubt


[21-Dec-18 11:10 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but radicals look ahead

sim vote 1-1 split

{Reactions}
yeahok 

[21-Dec-18 11:12 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the only factor is if the CA voters stay with the coalition


[21-Dec-18 11:13 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
there is a voter there who is on the left of CA


[21-Dec-18 11:13 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
which may prove crucial


[21-Dec-18 11:13 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[21-Dec-18 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
5-3 maybe?

gredsen is a wildcard


[21-Dec-18 12:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I don't think he'll factor in for a sim vote


[21-Dec-18 12:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and I feel he'll get just the 1 vote


[21-Dec-18 12:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
trouble is I got a 3-3 split in the vote between CA and SD


[21-Dec-18 12:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

the libs and udp can form government outright

now for the senate

I haven't bothered to set the computer up for this

1 lib, 1 udp, 1 ca, 1 SD, 1 radical

[23-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[23-Dec-18 02:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Sydney: here I called BC 5-3. This didn't happen. I had expected 2 sim votes here and in Whitlam (more on that in a sec), although that liekly wouldn't have made much of a change here. We also had a donkey vote here which is strange

Good morning everyone


[24-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We have a government


[24-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and it isn't a udp/lib one


[24-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[24-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now there have been a lot of media reports out in the last 12 hours about the makeup of the government


[24-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Many of which revolve around the CA's shock decision to join the Left


[24-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm going on record right now to set the story straight.


[24-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I negotiated the deal


[24-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I chose to accept it


[24-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The CA as a party supported it


[24-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But it was done fully with my approval


[24-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and under my leadership


[24-Dec-18 09:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It amazes me that the moment I do something which the libs don't agree with


[24-Dec-18 09:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
they begin to spread lies and falsaties


[24-Dec-18 09:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If I had have known that the lies which plagued them under PC would still be present now


[24-Dec-18 09:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I wouldn't have worked with them last term


[24-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For those wondering, there has been not one mention of leadership, except for when I asked if I still had support


[24-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
SPOILER WARNING: I did


[24-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
SO, the #LibLies can stop


[24-Dec-18 09:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
because I am still the CA leader


[24-Dec-18 09:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Today's topic: **Purchasing Iced Coffee From Hungry Jacks**


[29-Dec-18 09:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not sure about you interstate folk, but in South Australia, FUIC is available at every Hungry Jacks, cost $3.45.


[29-Dec-18 09:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have one from my local HJs with me right now. *sip*


[29-Dec-18 09:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, one point to make about it.


[29-Dec-18 09:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
It isn't around every time you go.


[29-Dec-18 09:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Sometimes when I go, the fridge out the front counter is empty.


[29-Dec-18 09:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
So, either, they go to the fridge in the back and get one. Which is the best outcome, of all, because it is extra cold.


[29-Dec-18 09:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or they tell you to go home


[29-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, under the Iced Coffee Regulation Act 2018 that has been floating around on 4chan recently, this would be illegal.


[29-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don't think anyone in Parliament would be dumb enough to introduce that though.


[29-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Would be quite fascist, or implementing FUICism as our Prime Minister once said.


[29-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now of course, if you can, go to Woolies or Foodland for FUIC.


[29-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Foodland seems to be the best bet recently, but be warned!


[29-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
I saw something terrifying last time I went.

Right now Australia is 6 runs with 10 wickets in hand, after being sent in to bat again by the Indians last night.


[07-Jan-19 12:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Australia could only come up with 300 runs for their first innings, just under half the total set by their opposition.


[07-Jan-19 12:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So under the follow-on rule, the Indians had the choice to send the Aussies in again.


[07-Jan-19 12:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Indians are in a dominant position but need the rain to stop very soon otherwise they won't be able to bowl the Aussies out by the end of the day.


[07-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Failing to do so will lead to a draw, but if they can remove the Aussies batting line up they will win the match.


[07-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Australians stand no hope of winning, but a draw can be salvaged.

The Aussies this morning fell to Jordan 1 nil.


[07-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As a result they sit bottom of group B with two games to play before the knockouts stages.


[07-Jan-19 12:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anas Bani Yaseen scored for the Jordanians after 26 minutes, thanks to a well placed header following a corner.


[07-Jan-19 12:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The result has drawn some controversy after a potential handball was missed by the referees, much to the Aussies' protests.


[07-Jan-19 12:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Australians will next play [Country which doesn't exist], who played out a nil all draw with Syria.

[09-Jan-19 09:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Bench is meant to be impartial and bipartisan.


[09-Jan-19 09:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Given the recent discussions from both the Government and Opposition, party politics may affect this vote.


[09-Jan-19 09:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Which I find disgraceful.


[09-Jan-19 09:51 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I have instructed my Parliamentarians that this is a free vote.


[09-Jan-19 09:51 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As it should be.


[09-Jan-19 09:51 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I urge all parties to make it a free vote.

[09-Jan-19 09:52 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now is the time for people's opinions.


[09-Jan-19 09:53 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For clarity, if I were to be given a vote, I would likely abstain from Maiq, and vote no to Sprinkles.


[09-Jan-19 09:54 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But again, what my opinions are should bear no relevance to anyone else's voting choice.


[09-Jan-19 09:54 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[09-Jan-19 11:21 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We lead today with breaking news from the land of the Virgin Australia Supercars Series


[09-Jan-19 11:21 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
where Veteran driver Garth Tander has been dumped out of Garry Rodgers Motorsport


[09-Jan-19 11:22 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
in favour of young New Zealander Richie Stanaway.


[09-Jan-19 11:23 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This news is a shock to many as Tander had a year left on his deal, and was likely to finish his career at the end of this season, giving him a year's farewell tour, much like what Craig Lowndes had in 2018.


[09-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
What happens next for the 41 year old is unclear.


[09-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
He had signed on to do a off track role with GRM following his contract, but whether that stands remains to be announced.


[09-Jan-19 11:25 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There is still seats open with former team mate Rick Kelly at the former Nissan Factory team, but otherwise this looks like the end of Tander's full time career.


[09-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It is most likely that Tander will take on a drive for the season of endurance at GRM this year.


[09-Jan-19 11:27 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Stanaway's appointment also comes along with sponsorship from Boost Mobile, who had previously sponsored Walkanshaw racing.


[09-Jan-19 11:27 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It is unclear if that arrangement will continue.


[09-Jan-19 11:28 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The season starts in March at the Adelaide 500.

I encourage everyone who is legitimately concerned about the Les Originals to PM me and I will answer truthfully any questions you have in as much detail as you like. I assure you all that this is all just sensationalism and is blowing the whole thing way out of proportion. There is nothing to get worked up about in reality. Also, think carefully about how one of the people we have cited as tying to destroy the Sim at times all of a sudden has multiple petitions up to depose members of the meta and canon moderators. Anyway,

ALL WHO ARE SIGNING THESE PETITIONS PLEASE PM ME SO I CAN GIVE YOU ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE SITUATION BEFORE THIS GETS OUT OF HAND.

Note: phone about to die may not get to answer your until a while from now apologies

So first of all, you've been.. well, campaigning recently, I guess? Considering we're barely a month into a term, what's the motive behind that?

Why should they look out? As far as I can recall your party's policies don't target the same base as the Liberals.


[18-Jan-19 06:53 PM] Plupsnup#9685

Abolishing income tax will let Australians save on their money. And no corporate tax will increase competition and drive price down

Just over 300 billion dollars will be lost in revenue if you abolish those two taxes.

Have you calculated what the revenue will be under a 30% GST?

Yes, you simply triple the company current revenue from the GST


[18-Jan-19 07:05 PM] Plupsnup#9685
So about 210 billion

We believe women have the right to go to the beach topless. Why should men be able to but women shouldn't. We are not forcing women to... We are just giving them the right to decide

I presume you would understand the sexual focus on women's breasts in the western world

Surely this would case a lot of issues?


[18-Jan-19 07:16 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Yes, and women don't focus on a man's breasts? If the women isn't comfortable being looked at, then my advice is that they shouldn't go topless. In my opinion, they would get the same looks if they were in a G-string bikini

[20-Jan-19 07:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so Bellman, you quit the bench to form this party. Why did you leave the bench and what urged you to form the party?


[20-Jan-19 07:42 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Because the bench is fucking shite. Literally nothing happens. I am very committed to doing all I can to help this community prosper, to bring this nation into a beautiful future but... On the bench I was doing fuck all. Also, I think a 3 man bench is ideal rather than four. As for what prompted me to form the party, well... (cont.)


[20-Jan-19 07:44 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
At first I was going to join the existing Liberty Reform Party, but there were a few key policy differences that they weren't willing to compromise on so I couldn't honestly put myself in that party room in good conscience. Furthermore, a couple of their members even expressed some distaste for the party direction, so I decided to fill that gap and begin a party which I could hear people wanted. And of course, there's the fact I am extremely passionate about these policies, and truly believe that if we were to implement them it would make AustraliaSim a truly better nation, which is all I want for this country.


[20-Jan-19 07:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Fair cop regarding the bench.


[20-Jan-19 07:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You mention Liberty Reform, who are also a fairly new party. Given that they would likely occupy a similar political area to you, do you fear that you could eat eachother's voters and thus hurt eachother?


[20-Jan-19 07:48 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I doubt it very much. As I said, I had intended to join Liberty Reform initially, and @Plupsnup and I are, at least for the moment, on good terms. So I expect us to work together towards the implementation of several shared key policies we hold. We will likely work together closely leading up to the election as well, so I think we can only help each other.


[20-Jan-19 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This isn't the first party that you have formed. What happened to all the other ones?


[20-Jan-19 07:52 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well the first party I formed was the Bellman United Party. We formed opposition in our first term, so that was a massive success. Shortly into the term we merged with the then Liberal Conservatives, and eventually the Church Militant Party, to become the Liberty Party which is still to this day the largest party the nation has ever seen. I took that party to government, however unfortunately we lost a VONC halfway through the term, at which point I stepped aside as leader and handed over to @PineappleCrusher_. He then made it the Liberal Party, so I suppose my party is still technically going.


[20-Jan-19 07:52 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The second was the Party of free Citizens, where as the leader I was able to server in the Senate, before merging with the Reason Party.


[20-Jan-19 07:52 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And then I left them to become a Justice.


[20-Jan-19 07:53 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So both parties were quite successful, people loved us. We di great work.


[20-Jan-19 07:53 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I expect the same from the United Australia Party also.


[20-Jan-19 07:53 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[20-Jan-19 07:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Given our parliaments volitile nature, will you stand a candidate in by electiosn should they arise


[20-Jan-19 07:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes


[20-Jan-19 07:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Of course.


[20-Jan-19 07:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I believe our policies are truly good for AustraliaSim. The sooner we can get a candidate in Parliament to promote them and introduce them, the better.


[20-Jan-19 07:59 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So of course if there is a chance for a by-election, we will stand.


[20-Jan-19 07:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[20-Jan-19 08:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
We're not here to 'work with' anyone... We will fight for our policies and what we truly believe to be good for AustraliaSim: the promotion of LIBERTY. If anyone puts out any kind of bill to that effect, we will support it, and we hope that they do the same with us.


[20-Jan-19 08:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So in effect you would be on the corssbench?


[20-Jan-19 08:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
We will go wherever we feel we would be best positioned to serve AustraliaSim.


[20-Jan-19 08:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So the big question. Why should the Australians watching tonight vote for your party, or even join your party?


[20-Jan-19 08:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Because we fight for true Liberty. FREEDOM. You know, our Parliament House was built into a hill for a very specific reason. The ability for our people to walk on top of Parliament was a beautiful symbolism for the people being more important than the government. Parliament are *under* the people. We are here to serve *you*. But you know what the government did? Built a fucking fence around the joint. And I believe that governments have not only done this literally, but metaphorical as well. I do not believe they are actually fighting for you. So the UAP has vowed to TEAR THAT FENCE DOWN. We are the ONLY party truly seeking to bring you freedom. We will TEAR THAT FENCE DOWN. Literally and metaphorically. We will restore the power to the people. We will. Make Australia Great Again.

[27-Jan-19 05:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[27-Jan-19 05:47 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The answer to the question is during this term in parliament, as I was elected to do, I shall.


[27-Jan-19 05:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Right.


[27-Jan-19 05:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I've had a look over your manifesto and there are a few questions I have regarding that


[27-Jan-19 05:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
firstly, you are taking a fairly right wing libertarian apporach with this party


[27-Jan-19 05:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
does it worry you that there are two other parties very similar to that?


[27-Jan-19 05:49 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
No, it doesn't. Although we have similarites to other parties, we are focused on delivering for the regions of Victoria and this has been shown in our regional focused policies.


[27-Jan-19 05:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so you're fine with voters possibly choosing other parties over yours, especially with the confusion regarding your left wing past and commitment to the left wing policy of militant unions?


[27-Jan-19 05:50 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Of course.


[27-Jan-19 05:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So you want to implement zonal taxation. What would that entail and what benefits would it bring?


[27-Jan-19 05:52 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We would lower taxes for regional areas to increase productivity and innovation for the producers of our nation to increase the wellbeing of not just regional Australians, but all Australians.

[27-Jan-19 05:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Would this also encourage people to leave the cities?


[27-Jan-19 05:54 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Perhaps, yes, this would help increase population and wellbeing of our regions.


[27-Jan-19 05:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Given that point, how would you deal with infrastructure out there, given it is very lackluster in comparison to that of the cities'


[27-Jan-19 05:56 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Our economic policies will attract investors to the regions, encouraging free market investment in infrastructure, as well as increasing the government infrastructure budget.


[27-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moving on now, you have stated that you support drug legalization. Given the number of lives drugs have taken and/or ruined, what makes you think that this is a good idea?


[27-Jan-19 05:59 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I've always supported this. It's better to regulate and monitor these drugs alongside discouraging their usage instead of letting people die over them.


[27-Jan-19 06:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but surely allowing them would increase rates of it being taken, thus an increase of the risk of people dieing?


[27-Jan-19 06:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Well, no- in countries like Portugal where they've decriminalised drugs, drug deaths have gone down due to support and love from the government.

Our firearms policy is currently up for debate within the party.


[27-Jan-19 06:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Righto.


[27-Jan-19 06:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll talk about your last point. You want to give indigenous people their land back as a part of progress to a treaty. Whilst this is a good idea, are you worried that your voter base, ie right wing farmers, would be upset that you wish to take their land off of them?


[27-Jan-19 06:12 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Well, no, I don't think so, there have been other agrarian parties with such policies. Bob Katter was an advocate for this while representing regional Queensland.


[27-Jan-19 06:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

I imagine that if I had land taken to give back to the natives I'd be upset, especially if that land had been in my family for generations. I get that it is what occured in the past, but there are times where neither option is fantastic.


[27-Jan-19 06:14 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Fair point.


[27-Jan-19 06:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moving on to the next part of my questions. Your manifesto itself is a tad on the brief side, with just 8 promises, all of which fit into 2 a4 pages. Do you think that people may not vote for you because of how vague you will be on so many issues?


[27-Jan-19 06:18 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Our manifesto will most likely be prone to change, with a new one to be released prior to the election, and it's better than many other parties with no manifesto. So no, I think people will still vote for us.


[27-Jan-19 06:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, why should Victorians, and in fact all aussies as you are technically registered nationally, vote for you?


[27-Jan-19 06:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We're a party that stands up for the regions of Victoria to deliver for the producers of our nation.

In a recent report on #today-tonight, they claimed to be the most reliable news source on the air, as voted by the public.


[28-Jan-19 08:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'd like to see where that statistic was found.


[28-Jan-19 08:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Especially given that I, tbyrn21, was voted best media personality of 2018.


[28-Jan-19 08:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, are you really the 'most trustworthy' media, or another lying scammer?

First, that statement is unfounded, which brings into question their claim as most reliable network.


[28-Jan-19 08:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And second, the fact that that is the best they got as a comeback, proves that it is indeed they who are the joke.

[03-Mar-19 06:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
No problem


[03-Mar-19 06:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
tell me, what is the highlight of the budget in your eyes?


[03-Mar-19 06:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh, that's a nice question. I think it's the Infrastructure Renewal Program to be honest. This is one of those programs that will deliver for the economy and the people. A truly great initative. Plus, everyone loves public transport!


[03-Mar-19 06:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They certainly do. One of the key parts of public transport discussions right now is the High Speed Rail. The budget papers indicate that the money in the budget is nation wide. Does this mean that we will see High Speed Rail from Cairns to Darwin?


[03-Mar-19 06:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the future, we imagine Australia will be connected throughout by High Speed Rail and future proof infrastructure. If we are able too, than you can bet there'll be connections to the Northern Territory that helps it connect to the rest of the country


[03-Mar-19 06:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So this money means that there will be HSR built with it all in one go, or is this a statement of 'maybe in 20 years when I'm well out of politics'?


[03-Mar-19 06:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
as in all nation not just the south east


[03-Mar-19 06:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Firstly, we will focus on the renewal of existing infrastructure. Plans for a hyperloop are also in consideration. After we have managed to pull our existing infrastructure out of the dark ages,  then we will hopefully be able to start investing in new infrastructure. Hopefully this will be acomplished quickly, but I can't make any promises.


[03-Mar-19 06:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But the money clearly states it is for 'nation wide high speed rail'. What you have said here indicates that it is not for that. Would it be fair to say then that that is a misleading claim?


[03-Mar-19 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Nation wide in my interpretation refers to across all and territories. It's fair to say that our urban renewal program will upgrade all existing infrastructure across the country to the future. That includes regional and urban rail across the States and Territories.


[03-Mar-19 06:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But its nation wide high speed rail, not nation wide goat tracks/

[03-Mar-19 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Rural Regions have significant amounts of Railway and roads that have been neglected for some time. To say that our upgrades to Rural Railway would be upgrading Goat Tracks is fairly misleading


[03-Mar-19 06:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm saying that you aren't giving rural regions HSR, which is clearly stated will occur in the budget paper


[03-Mar-19 06:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Renewal programs and HSR will be provided across the continent to where they are needed and for the benefit of Australians. To deny that is silly.


[03-Mar-19 06:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Lets move on. There have been a number of mergers of portfolio in this budget. What was the reason for this and did it make the job any harder?


[03-Mar-19 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Previously we had seen a bloated and inefficent cabinet system. While the government faced some flack for it early on, I think it has payed off. While initially there was some difficulty allocating resources, with proper intergovernment coordination and a skilled team, we managed to properly deliver a budget.


[03-Mar-19 06:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And deliver you did. There is a nice surplus of 2.6 Billion. How important was it to achieve this?


[03-Mar-19 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
A surplus was very important to deliver in my opinion. While I do not believe in Austerity, I think it is important we maintain a small nestegg of sorts, that we can use to fall back on or reward Australians if the conditions allow for it.


[03-Mar-19 06:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
1.3 Billion is also quite good for farmers who are going through some hard times. Is there any other inititives headed the way of helping farmers?


[03-Mar-19 06:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
As we've talked about previously, Infrastructure to rural areas will boost the economy of those in the regions, and allow our farmers quicker and cheaper ways to export their goods. Combined with a renewed committment to international relations and open trade, we will see exports for Farmers increase dramatically. That is a serious boom in these difficult times and it, combined with drought relief is going to ensure that our agriculture sector is soaring


[03-Mar-19 06:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well @Deleted User I'd like to thank you not only for coming on tonight, but also for pumping out a budget, something which not all governments do these days.

We have received a statement from Dicky "Richard" Knee


[05-Mar-19 06:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
```
There is an element within the party who were placed as a cell for the BUP. They attempted to vote for a merger with the BUP, essentially destroying the Liberal brand and party. When this vote failed, the colluders started a fake headquarters and have lied to encourage the party faithful to leave the party. Clearly they are set out only to destroy, and frankly I won't tolerate this.

The LC is left without a majority and relies on the CA to keep them in power.

chaos in the left


[06-Mar-19 09:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
@Youmaton is here to murder someone I think


[06-Mar-19 09:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
they look angry


[06-Mar-19 09:32 PM] Youmaton#1190
Hello...


[06-Mar-19 09:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so whats going on


[06-Mar-19 09:32 PM] Youmaton#1190
What seems to be going on, unless I am mistaken, is that the Treasurer has chosen to betray the Australian people.


[06-Mar-19 09:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Thats crazy. Was there indication that this would happen?


[06-Mar-19 09:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
I knew that he wished to resign from the party due to his more centirst leanings and friendships within the United Democratic Party, however he had promised that he would continue to serve as Treasurer until the budget was passed.


[06-Mar-19 09:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
There was never an indication that he would side with fascist AussieConservative.


[06-Mar-19 09:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That is just shocking. Do you think you can still get the budget through, or will the treasurer vote down his own budget?


[06-Mar-19 09:36 PM] Youmaton#1190
He has already voted yes to the budget, but I am unsure as to if he will change his vote.

[06-Mar-19 09:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Interesting times ahead then. I asked before the Brisbane By election if your government would survive till the natural election date. Still reckon you'll make it?


[06-Mar-19 09:39 PM] Youmaton#1190
Unfortunately not due to this betrayal. I have organised a cabinet meeting to take place shortly, where final regulations will be pushed out, followed by the calling of an election.


[06-Mar-19 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000

[06-Mar-19 09:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

do you have anything to say to your former colleague


[06-Mar-19 09:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the mic is yours


[06-Mar-19 09:42 PM] Youmaton#1190
Im honestly shocked. Horror is someone that I welcomed into the Social Democratic Party with open arms last election, and together we rode a wave into office. I considered him to be someone who could one day replace me as SocDem leader, now I know I was foolish to trust him.

[06-Mar-19 09:46 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Hello.


[06-Mar-19 09:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Welcome on.


[06-Mar-19 09:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whats your take on the chaos unfolding?


[06-Mar-19 09:48 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Its not unexpected if I'm being honest. The people of trades hall have always told me not to trust social democrats and I suppose pretending that someone jumping from centre left to the right to fight against "radicalism" hasn't happened before. As for CA, them pulling out is something I think the LC planned for but couldn't do anything against.


[06-Mar-19 09:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
*the CA hasn't pulled out*


[06-Mar-19 09:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
does the ACTU still support the LC in general or will the LC die with the government?


[06-Mar-19 09:50 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The ACTU will support any government that stands up for the workers of Australia. Seeming that we may see a UDP government, or a Centre-Right government, I suspect we'll be back to being called "Union Thugs" by the end of next week


[06-Mar-19 09:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We're hearing that a Motion of No Confidence has been called. Do you think it will pass?


[06-Mar-19 09:52 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Yeah I do. But whats the point in calling a VONC if an election is going to be called if it doesn't pass? Just let the government call the election and lets Australia pick who it wants to lead after this mess.


[06-Mar-19 09:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well i guess someone could get the prestige of being PM, even if for 2 weeks. Now in all of this the CA could stay loyal to the LC. They are yet to officially make their stance known. Do you think they will go down with the ship or jump off now?


[06-Mar-19 09:54 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Honestly. CA could do either. I bet their group chat is filled with rapid discussion at the moment.


[06-Mar-19 09:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
M: lol


[06-Mar-19 09:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, will the ACTU be going out and campaigning or endorsing candidates ahead of the ever closer election?


[06-Mar-19 09:56 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
It really depends on how everyone is feeling in a week. We haven't completed sorted out internally yet. But it's a soft yes at the moment. As for who we'll be campaigning for, we'll see.


[06-Mar-19 09:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We're hearing the CA are starting a press conference


[06-Mar-19 09:58 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

well that is surely the election being called


[06-Mar-19 10:03 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Good move in my opinion. It'll allow the people of wright to actually elect a person they want. Other than a flip flopping conspiracy theorist.


[06-Mar-19 10:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Thats a fair call


[06-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now whilst I have you here, i have a rather juicy question to ask. In the LC, what is the ACTU's preferred party, and thus leader of the LC?


[06-Mar-19 10:06 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
None of them at the moment. Youmaton and I haven't had many interactions so I can't put my trust in a person I don't know. And DKR and her party seem to be gunning for me to get fired, so not her. CM was the leader of the Radical Party for a bit and they're now defunct, but I've heard good things, but he can't be chosen. Thats my reasoning anyway.


[06-Mar-19 10:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Fair call.


[06-Mar-19 10:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well, do you have any other remarks that you would like to make regarding this situation, or life in general?


[06-Mar-19 10:08 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Life in general? I imagine my job is going to get a lot harder very very soon. Regarding this situation? Censors get ready, this is one hell of a clusterf***.


[06-Mar-19 10:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
its ok, its 10:38pm in the eastern states, no censor watches that late right?


[06-Mar-19 10:09 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

Some interesting statistics here...


[09-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Results showing CA as the largest party and UDP and Conservatives tied for the smallest.


[09-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which in my opinion is just a weird result compared to the size of the respective parties.


[09-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is also showing the decreasing popularity of the right in Australia anyway.

It should be noted that the form did say 'Lieselta' under the CA banner but now that silicon is leader, he would be the CA's PM candidate.

Pulling ahead by a good margin is DirtySaiyan of the UDP, and 0% for Griffo.

they are

'Dicky_Knee ‚Äì Liberal Party'
 'TheGreatSenator ‚Äì United Australia Party'
 'Cenarchos ‚Äì Social Democratic Party'


[17-Mar-19 02:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
we add the 2 other UDPs, the CA, the lib and the SDP


[17-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The SDP almost has command of the House


[17-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but no control in the Senate


[17-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
These are the options for Government


[17-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
SDP - SP


[17-Mar-19 02:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
this is a continuation of last term's LC, minus the CA


[17-Mar-19 02:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However recent reports have displayed a falling out between the two


[17-Mar-19 02:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This also leads to a Senate where they only control 2 of the 9 seats.


[17-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
SDP - UDP


[17-Mar-19 02:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This one seems unlikely but the two centre ish parties would command control of both houses

There is enough there to control both houses and push the SDP to opposition


[17-Mar-19 02:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but it is going to be a nightmare to do


[17-Mar-19 02:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
SDP - Lib - UAP


[17-Mar-19 02:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This would be an Anti Centre Alliance, and gives enough to control both houses by one


[17-Mar-19 02:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It would however be a massive shift from the left stance of the SDP in the past


[17-Mar-19 02:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
While unlikely, we've seen chaos before


[17-Mar-19 02:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the CA went left last term

There is a near certainty that they will retain the PM status provided they strike a deal

[17-Mar-19 02:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[17-Mar-19 02:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[17-Mar-19 02:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I see two feesable scenarios


[17-Mar-19 02:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The first is a SDP - SP coalition


[17-Mar-19 02:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This, however, would likely lead to a double dissolution in a few weeks


[17-Mar-19 02:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The second, is we go to the polls in a week or two, without government being formed.

I asked if they would prefer the SP or the UDP, and they kept the cards close to their chest on that one.


[17-Mar-19 03:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It is still the opinion of this reporter that it will be the SP who give Youma enough for the house, but the senate will still be tricky for them.

Uni is fun but time consuming


[31-Mar-19 07:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway I should probably get to the crux of what I am doing this for


[31-Mar-19 07:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
because there are more than personal reasons as to why I haven't done much here or reported much on #skynews


[31-Mar-19 07:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
recently I haven't kept much of an eye on the politics of the sim

The same Social Democratic Party that took out a near majority last election is now on 1 seat, that being their leaders.

The same story with the United Democrats, who have been left with one seat in the HoR. But not all hope is lost for them, with a chance in the Senate with 2 seats in a 7 seat chamber.

Today we also saw the removal of long term parliamentarians from their seats.

Drunk_King_Robert has been sworn in as Prime Minister of Australia this morning, beginning a new Socialist era for Australia.


[07-May-19 01:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Her cabinet was sworn in as well.


[07-May-19 01:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
A key theme in this cabinet is the amount of portfolios that Drunk_King_Robert has taken.


[07-May-19 01:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Prime Minister has the following portfolios:
Culture
Defence
Foreign Affairs & Trade
Health
Infrastructure/Transport
Women


[07-May-19 01:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is interesting that the Prime Minister has decided to take key portfolios such as Health, Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Infrastructure and take them for herselves, rather than allowing the many other MPs/Senators with little or no portfolios to share the load.


[07-May-19 01:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is this a sign of DKR not trusting her own cabinet?

[15-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Hi all


[15-Jun-19 09:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Just a few quick comments about the by-election today.


[15-Jun-19 09:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
First, Sydney was close


[15-Jun-19 09:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Wow that was close


[15-Jun-19 09:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Basically I just wanted to say that from the outside, as a neutral on looker, the system appears to be working.


[15-Jun-19 09:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We've seen a party (namely the Whigs) really work hard in the recent times and their efforts were nearly rewarded tonight.


[15-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It did (at least in my opinion) seem to also model that preferences sometimes will or won't flow, and I think that played a small part in the contest in Sydney.


[15-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As for Moncreiff


[15-Jun-19 09:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I hope I spelled that right


[15-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway as for Moncan'tbebotherspellingitright,

Moncrieff.


[15-Jun-19 09:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The system took note of the random independent who put up (as far as I'm aware) one post, and duely delivered them very few votes.


[15-Jun-19 09:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
also thank you liesel


[15-Jun-19 09:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Again if you look at the votes here you can see mostly where the votes would go (ie they weren't purely random, they did mostly follow some sort of real life pattern)


[15-Jun-19 09:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and to me, this system is delivering much better than the old one used to


[15-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So I for one am thankful for my new simmed overlords


[15-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[30-Jul-19 01:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This leaves 5 seats in the crossbench

Namely, the two agrarians, and one each from SA-Best, the revolutionary socialists and the south Gippsland network.

First, one notes the lack of mention for the SGN in the analysis section of channel nine's broadcast.


[30-Jul-19 01:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Given the connections between the network and the channel, one suspects there might be something here.

[30-Jul-19 01:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But on the same token, very little mention is made of the SA-Best either.


[30-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The agrarians, to me atleast, seem the most likely for the UDP to attempt to get in government


[30-Jul-19 01:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
a two seat party is easier to control, as both will generally vote in unison


[30-Jul-19 01:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We here at #skynews are predicting the SGN and the agrarians to be (in some fashion) supporting the udp. SA-Best may be there as well, although we are less sure on that.


[30-Jul-19 01:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I guess we will wait and see who it is.

Well folks we've barely had them in for a few days, and they already want to leave


[01-Aug-19 03:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Australians were not shocked at all to find that one of the people they had elected to parliament has already fled the scene.


[01-Aug-19 03:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I am of course referring to Former Liberal Senator DavidSwifty, who last night resigned their senate spot.


[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Occurring late last night, he revealed that he was actually an illegal immigrant named Juan.


[01-Aug-19 03:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
One wonders why Juan was selected by the One party who can stand up and oppose the government, in the Liberal party.


[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Maybe they could have one or two more policies to ensure that there is not one more person leave this parliament?


[01-Aug-19 03:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway, Juan becomes the number One person to leave Parliament this term


[01-Aug-19 03:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We expect he won't be the only Juan.

Although I really shouldn't slag this one off to much, as they have since joined the High Court as a Justice


[26-Aug-19 07:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yes, I do of course refer to DirtySaiyan who resigned late last week to fill the spot vacated by Tobycool on the bench.


[26-Aug-19 07:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[02-Sep-19 03:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Theres been another poll released over the weekend and its not good signs for the PM, as he remains behind in preferred Prime Minister


[02-Sep-19 03:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whilst climbing by 1% to 35%, he remains 3 points back on the leader of the opposition.


[02-Sep-19 03:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The bad news doesn't stop there, as he loses a bit of his lead in the two party preferred, although that still sits at 54-46.


[02-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, we here at #skynews have a political analyst, although, many haven't seen him in quite some time.


[02-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Skytony Orange used to be a major factor on this channel, but following a major shift in the voting patterns, he refused to leave his box for quite some time.


[02-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"I just don't understand how it all works yet!" he said.


[02-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But someone has to pay the bills so we've forced him out of the box and made him analyse the latest poll.


[02-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And he's got some interesting news.


[02-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*crosses to Skytony Orange*


[02-Sep-19 03:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well yes I'll start with Lingiari. The government had held that seat but look all but certain to lose that seat this weekend.


[02-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The poll said 53% of respondents would be voting Labor, whilst 28% were voting for Change Australia. Just 19% would vote National.


[02-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We have just seen the appearance of the UDP's candidate in the area, but he'd have a lot of work to do to change this.


[02-Sep-19 04:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
One point of my analysis was to look at the Lingiari poll compared to the nation at large, and it does paint a slightly different picture.


[02-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It tells me that based on the nation as a whole, Labor should be polling at 60% compared to the other two parties with data.


[02-Sep-19 04:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The CA should only be at 12%, so are doing unbelievably well, but the Nats have lost a slice of the pie to the CA.


[02-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This indicates that the CA are running a good campaign in the local area and are driving more voters to them. Furthermore, Labor seems to be coasting as they think this will be an easy win for them.


[02-Sep-19 04:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If we redo this analysis with the UDP factored in, then they will get 45% of the vote to labor's 33%. The CA would sit at 7% and the nats with 15.


[02-Sep-19 04:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But if we adjust based on the more accurate values for the other three, we get Labor on 29%, the CA on 15 and the nats on just 10%.


[02-Sep-19 04:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, whether the UDP can hold that 45% is up for debate. They won Lingiari at the last election, albeit unopposed.


[02-Sep-19 04:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They have seen a swing across the country since the election towards them, jumping 11% in first preferences.


[02-Sep-19 04:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But all of that can be for nothing if your candidate is a sack of potatoes; which may or may not be the case here.


[02-Sep-19 04:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So right now, I'm calling this a Labor win, but if the UDP candidate does infact exist, then we might see a good fight between the two.


[02-Sep-19 04:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moving on now to the rest of the house.


[02-Sep-19 04:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yes, the next election is quite some time away, but there is some interesting points to make.


[02-Sep-19 04:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Firstly, all seats with unopposed elections have seen swings towards that party (if you combine the Libs and Nats as the LNP) since the election.


[02-Sep-19 04:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The more interesting news comes from the seats of Sydney and Mayo.


[02-Sep-19 04:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
First to Sydney.


[02-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Sydney was won in the hotly contested supplementary election, where the Libs won with 50.8% of the 2PP against the UDP.


[02-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Based on a consistent national swing, that seat falls to the UDP by a big margin.


[02-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And then on to Mayo


[02-Sep-19 04:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It is currently held by the SA Best by 53.8 over the Libs


[02-Sep-19 04:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But if you apply a consistent swing, they now only have 49.65%.


[02-Sep-19 04:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That would be enough to give the seat to the Libs, but that one will come down to how the election pans out.


[02-Sep-19 04:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Other than that it looks like there is a sizeable swing towards The current MP for Cunningham.


[02-Sep-19 04:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Thats it for the House.


[02-Sep-19 04:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But lastly the senate.


[02-Sep-19 04:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Currently we have a 7 seat senate. 4 were elected last time, meaning three are up for grabs this time.


[02-Sep-19 04:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
These seats will go to the UDP, Libs and Labor on this make up.


[02-Sep-19 04:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If the Libs run a joint ticket with the Nats, they get the first seat, whilst divided they get the second whilst the UDP gets the first.


[02-Sep-19 04:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This is good signs for the new Labor party, provided they can field enough candidates.


[02-Sep-19 04:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Other than that there is nothing new to talk about.

What we see now is a second by-election looming, and will likely occur next week, just 1 week after Lingiari.


[04-Sep-19 10:12 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I fully expect to see a big set of candidates for that seat, mostly comprising of the losers from Lingiari.


[04-Sep-19 10:12 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
A sort of By-election 2: Lingiari Boogaloo if you like.


[04-Sep-19 10:13 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
One of the more interesting things we've seen though is the reemergence of former Prime Minister Youmaton.

[04-Sep-19 10:16 AM] Youmaton#1190
The... game?


[04-Sep-19 10:16 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Of politics


[04-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Youmaton#1190
Retirement was enjoyable, certainly needed. After a long time of service, a break was deeply needed to reevaluate and heal.


[04-Sep-19 10:17 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
What has made you come back?


[04-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Youmaton#1190
The reappearance of the unprofessionalism within the parliament. The expectation from some politicians that they can misbehave and get away with it. The parliament are the elected representatives of the people, not the other way around.

[04-Sep-19 10:20 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Fair enough, its a lot of the reason why I started this specific program.


[04-Sep-19 10:21 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You have a good history with the people of cunningham, winning the seat in March before then retaining it in May prior to your retirement. Do you think you will be able to bank off of that name recognition?


[04-Sep-19 10:22 AM] Youmaton#1190
I certainly hope that the people of Cunningham can lend their trust to me once again.


[04-Sep-19 10:23 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You are likely going to be up against a big field, with a lot of those who lose this week in Lingiari expected to make the move to Cunningham. Does a large number of candidates scare you, or is it all part of a by-election such as this?


[04-Sep-19 10:25 AM] Youmaton#1190
That's the nature of politics, especially in such a high profile by-election such as this. I hope that my history of delivering for Cunningham can show what I can achieve for the electorate.


[04-Sep-19 10:26 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Do you have any new ideas or changes from the past, or should voters expect more of the Youma they knew and loved?


[04-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Youmaton#1190
A bit of both in a way. I have many surprises, which will be revealed as the campaign goes on.


[04-Sep-19 10:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Finally Youma, do you have anything you would like to say to voters now to start your movement?


[04-Sep-19 10:32 AM] Youmaton#1190
It's time to send a message across the board. Enough is enough.


[04-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Makes sense to me.


[04-Sep-19 10:33 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Thank you for joining me Youma.


[04-Sep-19 10:34 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Our focus will now look at this weeks important vote in Lingiari.


[04-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As expected, we've seen a few more candidates enter the race.


[04-Sep-19 10:39 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We now have Elleeit from the Nationals, DexterAamo from the Liberals, Gavingrotegut from labor, and sys_33_error from the UDP. It appears that Woof is pulling out of the race following the collapse of the CA. He claims it is because he missed out on being the candidate for the Liberals.


[04-Sep-19 10:40 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If Woof does pull out, then this gives a big shift in this race.


[04-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
One would imagine most of those votes would flow to Labor, rather than the Libs or Nats or the UDP.


[04-Sep-19 10:41 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Given the lead Labor had early on, one suspects they may be able to hang on.


[04-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, the late emergence of the UDP and Liberals means that this race is no longer simple.


[04-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Without better data, we're standing by our initial prediction of a Labor victory, but its hard to know with all thats gone on.


[04-Sep-19 10:42 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Well folks, you don't broadcast for a few days, and then chaos happens.


[12-Sep-19 02:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yes viewers, its Juan time.


[12-Sep-19 02:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Since the resignation of MBOM on the third, we have seen 4 further pollies leave parliament.

[12-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
First came the disappearance of AussieConservative, often referred to as Griffo.


[12-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That occurred on the 6th.


[12-Sep-19 02:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Then yesterday, we saw the shock resignations of both Bsharri from the house, and tobycool2001_1 from the Senate.


[12-Sep-19 02:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Finally today, mere days after getting the role, Lieselta has been forced to resign from the senate (the very seat vacated by Griffo's disapearance) due to health problems


[12-Sep-19 02:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
What this means is that we now have 8 Juans on the Board of Shame, four of them being Liberal Senators.


[12-Sep-19 02:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
A blue wave of the board.

We here at sky hope that there isn't too many more Juans, as the board is looking very full right now.

[09-Nov-19 06:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You've waited almost 12 months for this.


[09-Nov-19 06:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But now its finally here.


[09-Nov-19 06:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The return of a AustraliaSim staple to your tv screens.


[09-Nov-19 06:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The one, the only:


[09-Nov-19 06:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
AussimVision.


[09-Nov-19 06:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yes after a very long hiatus we're bringing back the most loved and most successful series back to your televisions.


[09-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So what do you have to do?


[09-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well, its pretty simple.


[09-Nov-19 06:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
To enter this fantastic competition, you submit me a youtube link of a song, which fits our rules.


[09-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The main rule that almost always applies, is that the song must not have appeared before.


[09-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That can be seen on this list https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_OkIS0OtGmG8AAbKXPqb-S4LPShMt9abltjokeGhP3E/edit?usp=sharing

[09-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Other than that, there is normally a round theme.


[09-Nov-19 06:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, I'm feeling nice this time.


[09-Nov-19 06:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So to celebrate the return of an icon, there is no theme.


[09-Nov-19 06:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Once I have enough entries, I'll run the show, and then you can vote.


[09-Nov-19 06:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Ideally, you will all have submitted by Friday.


[09-Nov-19 06:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

this is a reminder that you do not submit a song of yourself (that said there is no rule against it). If it is a song, and its on Youtube (and not already on the earlier list or taken by another player) then i can accept it.

As always, voting will occur at the end of the show. All contestants will rank each song and submit them to me via DM. The scoring is the same as Eurovision, so the best songs get 12 points and the top 10 get points. You cannot vote for your own song.

pointingboi 

[15-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
DM me an ordered list of all the songs (as we have less than 10 which you can vote for).


[15-Nov-19 07:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Your favourite gets 12 points, then second gets 10, then 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and the last song tonight gets 2 points.


[15-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If we have more songs, we add the 1 point, then everything outside of your top 10 you give 0.


[15-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll set the voting deadline to 6:00PM Sunday afternoon Queensland time, or 47 and a bit hours from now.


[15-Nov-19 07:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Failure to vote will see your song deducted a large amount of points.

5th place is @RunasSudo on 59 points.

One point ahead of that gives @Napoleon Freeze 4th place.


[17-Nov-19 06:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
One point more gives @Anacornda a podium on their debut.


[17-Nov-19 06:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And now the top two.


[17-Nov-19 06:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Both of these songs have done well.


[17-Nov-19 06:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Head and shoulders above the rest.


[17-Nov-19 06:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

One step closer to taking the all time record out of Runas's hands.

The rules are: Your song must contain a body part in the title. As always, it cannot have appeared in a previous AussimVision. To Enter, Youtube link to me.


[17-Nov-19 06:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For clarity, I'll allow "body" and other general words, but not "person"

[11-Jan-20 08:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
although maybe not callable


[11-Jan-20 08:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
although denison on 2pp looks safe labor


[11-Jan-20 08:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
which can probs be called


[11-Jan-20 08:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so labor 1, and libs 1 with brisbane

alp vote should flow to sdp


[11-Jan-20 08:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so i'd say sdp ahead


[11-Jan-20 08:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
pending the flow


[11-Jan-20 08:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
next to sydney, that looks safe nat


[11-Jan-20 08:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so lib 1 lab 1 nat 1


[11-Jan-20 08:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
also the abc computer has "sdp1 other 1, lib 1, which i dont get unless they have other numbers


[11-Jan-20 08:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

next is mayo, which is solidifying as a probable wind for sdp


[11-Jan-20 08:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
needs 1.4% which is feesable


[11-Jan-20 08:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
god the abc are slow


[11-Jan-20 08:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the abc computer now has 2 lnp, 1 sdp and 1 other

they'd need the libs to send all their votes to the nats to lose this


[11-Jan-20 08:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
now to melbourne, where the ALP are somehow losing to a newcomer


[11-Jan-20 08:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the nats look promising at 51.3% after nearly half the count


[11-Jan-20 08:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and now to mayo, where the sdp are losing ground


[11-Jan-20 08:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
liesel is not ahead, but the nat prefs should do it, although still not callable


[11-Jan-20 08:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Now, I have seen a fairly large number of new movies over this Australian Summer, with this film being my 7th in the last three or so months that I have seen at the box office.


[26-Feb-20 06:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Not that this qualifies me as a movie reviewer, of course. Its just unusually high for me.


[26-Feb-20 06:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway, *Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey* has had a rough time in cinemas. It opened in a fairly disappointing manner, prompting the title change from the original name of *Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn*.


[26-Feb-20 06:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, whilst I think this is a better title, its a bit late to change it once a majority of the people who were going to see it have already done so. So late infact, that the opening title still shows the original mouthful of a title.


[26-Feb-20 06:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But that wasn't the only reason why the title changed; however, I'll get to that in a minute.


[26-Feb-20 06:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
First off, Margot Robbie does a really good job as Harley Quinn in this film.


[26-Feb-20 06:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
She's expressive, and demonstrates the unique personality of Harley really well, just as she did in *Suicide Squad*.


[26-Feb-20 06:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The films humour is mostly good, I myself had moments where I was really laughing, and there was no howlers so to speak; although the reference to voting for Bernie was rather odd, and does have a small effect of locking this film to a specific timeperiod, especially if Bernie doesn't get preselected as Presidential Candidate.


[26-Feb-20 06:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There is also an odd fascination with breaking people's legs in cruel and unusual ways, for some reason.


[26-Feb-20 06:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, this is about all I can say in a truly positive tone; as I have a few critisisms.


[26-Feb-20 06:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
First off, it takes far too long for the plot to develop.


[26-Feb-20 06:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I mean, the Birds of Prey only really exist for fifteen minutes - the title change at least makes it more obvious who the main character of the film is.


[26-Feb-20 06:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Furthermore, the explanation of preceding events is incredibly jumpy, and does make it harder to follow at times.


[26-Feb-20 06:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Theres also a point where the movie just gives up at trying to make any sense, instead just making a character talk to the camera to basically say "we dunno how to transition between these two cool set pieces we have, so just ignore that".


[26-Feb-20 06:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Ok maybe that wasn't the exact quote but you get my point.


[26-Feb-20 06:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Speaking of set pieces, the fight choreography is quite repetitive, and at times looks too staged to actually seem believable, which is a real shame given it appears to be the main premise of the film.


[26-Feb-20 06:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
All of the males in the film are nasty, horrible people: now this might be a social commentary, its quite jarring and can make viewing uncomfortable especially if like me, you have a penis.

[26-Feb-20 06:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And its a real shame that the negatives outweigh the positives here; I really wanted to enjoy this movie and it wanted to be a really fun movie, but it just falls over a little too much in certain areas. Did I enjoy myself watching it? Yes. Would I hurry to watch it again? No. Would I recommend it to others? Eh, maybe.

[26-Feb-20 06:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Overall, I give this film a 6/10.

[26-Feb-20 06:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Sadly for this film, the news continues to not be good, as it is struggling to do much better than double it's budget at the box office, with heavy reliance on the international market rather than the "domestic" market of the US and Canada.


[26-Feb-20 06:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For context, *Sonic the Hedgehog* is a whole week newer, yet has already gotten $25 million ahead worldwide, with a similarly sized budget.


[26-Feb-20 06:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, the big question is where does this movie stack up against the rest of the movies I've seen this summer?


[26-Feb-20 06:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well, here is my list:


[26-Feb-20 06:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
1. *Sonic the Hedgehog*, 10/10
2. *1917*, 10/10
3. *Ford v Ferrari*, 9/10
4. *Bad Boys for Life*, 7/10
5. *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*, 6/10
6. ***Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey*, 6/10**
7. *Knives Out*, 4/10


[26-Feb-20 06:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moving on to the Box office figures, and *Sonic* has spent his second weekend at the top of the domestic charts, just edging out *The Call of the Wild*. *Birds of Prey* was a distant third with the years top earner *Bad Boys for Life* and then new comer *Brahms: The Boy II* rounding out the top 5.


[26-Feb-20 06:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Australian Figures from last weekend still appear to be unavailable.


[26-Feb-20 06:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As for next weekend, there is only one new major release (being *The Invisible Man*), meaning that the battle appears to be once again between an animated hedgehog with an old actor, and an animated dog with a really old actor.


[26-Feb-20 06:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This is the point where i plan to end the program; however, if people have specific movies that I want to explain their score I am happy to do so.


[26-Feb-20 06:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Ok so I've had a request to explain my Knives Out


[26-Feb-20 06:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Right so Knives Out I went into hoping for a movie that I'd really like.


[26-Feb-20 06:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm usually a fan of detective movies and this one should have been fantastic, especially given the cast on hand.


[26-Feb-20 06:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The issues were apparent right up when Daniel Craig rocks up with an American Accent, and lines that sound like they came straight out of r/BrandNewSentence


[26-Feb-20 06:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The movie gives away the murder before the halfway point, and becomes an action getaway / covering tracks movie, which is not what I asked for.


[26-Feb-20 06:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Some other characters are added and then killed as a plot device?


[26-Feb-20 06:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Then its revealed that main character girl didn't kill him but it was staged so she did.


[26-Feb-20 06:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The main arc of the plot was so convoluted and I didn't like it at all.


[26-Feb-20 06:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The whole "vomits when lying" thing was pure gold I admit, but the writers did themselves a disservice with basically everything else in this film.


[26-Feb-20 06:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Cinematography was pretty good I admit, but it was carrying a poor script and a silly plot.


[26-Feb-20 06:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
4/10, go watch *Murder on the Orient Express* from a year or two back if you want a detective film.


[26-Feb-20 07:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well folks, thats all for today. Tune in next time when I review another movie and/or talk about box office figures.

Welcome to the second episode of *tbyrn's Movies*!


[04-Mar-20 12:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll start this week with the Box Office news.


[04-Mar-20 12:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And the news is good this week as newcomer *The Invisible Man* has shot to the top of the Box Office, earning $28 million in the US and Canada.


[04-Mar-20 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The film was not expected to do so well, but by doing so it becomes the first Australian made movie to top the US/Canada box office since *Knowing*, in 2009.


[04-Mar-20 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Not even *Mad Max* or *The Great Gatsby* could achieve this feat.


[04-Mar-20 12:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*Sonic the Hedgehog* then slides to second place, again beating out *The Call of the Wild*, but both film's weekend gross totals only just exceed that of *The Invisible Man*.


[04-Mar-20 12:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising* enters the chart with a solid $5.8 Million from just 1172 cinemas, a quarter of the number normally seen by big name films.


[04-Mar-20 12:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*Bad Boys for Life* Rounds out the top 5 in its 7th week, overtaking *Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey* which appears to be stalling and may have exhausted its legs.


[04-Mar-20 12:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This week a rather large number of movies enter, headlined by *Onward*, which is Pixar's latest offering to movie goers.


[04-Mar-20 12:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Otherwise, Ben Affleck stars in a Sports Drama movie called *The Way Back*, from Warner Brothers.


[04-Mar-20 12:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
With coronavirus fears rising, the film industry is expected to start to suffer, with several cinemas being closed in certain regions, and many films now starting to be delayed.


[04-Mar-20 12:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That wraps up the box office news for this week, so that means it is time for the film review.

ü¶î 

[04-Mar-20 12:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, I couldn't review this film without giving something to compare it against, so today's review is a double header, with last year's *Detective Pikachu*.


[04-Mar-20 12:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now when considering how I would structure this review, before i watched DP i would not have expected to do it like this, but afterwards I noticed several glaring similarities.


[04-Mar-20 12:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, I would like to make it clear that this will probably have spoilers in this review, so umm, yeah.


[04-Mar-20 12:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The easiest way to explain the similarities in these films is to add a third movie to the mix, that film being *Emperor's New Groove*, released by Disney in 2000.


[04-Mar-20 12:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The comparison here is fairly simple.


[04-Mar-20 12:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
All three films see a main character who ends up being forced to work with a second character, whom they don't particularly like but because "story" they have to, with the film ending with them as best friends.


[04-Mar-20 12:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
in *StH*, we see this in the form of Sonic befriending a police officer whom he has been stalking for ten years, whilst in *DP* its the son of a dead investigator working with his dad's Pikachu, despite disliking Pokemon in general.


[04-Mar-20 12:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Its a path which many films have taken before.


[04-Mar-20 12:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That said, there is nothing wrong with this path provided you do it well.


[04-Mar-20 12:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*StH* does an excellent job at showing the relationship grow, and allows you to ride the highs and lows of the character's emotions.


[04-Mar-20 12:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*DP* is not as strong in this regard, in that most emotional moments either feel unearnt or just abrupt in character development.


[04-Mar-20 12:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That said, the ending of *DP* is really good, and makes up for the errors in this regard during the first half of the movie.


[04-Mar-20 12:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I would say that *StH* is the more consistent of the two films in that regard, whilst *DP* is better in periods.


[04-Mar-20 12:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And the same story continues when it comes to visual effects.


[04-Mar-20 12:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Pokemon in *DP* look absolutely fantastic, but there is a scene where whoever was in charge of the green screen effects needs to be fired.


[04-Mar-20 12:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*StH* is more consistent in quality, but is outshone by sections of *DP*.


[04-Mar-20 12:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The same can be said for most aspects of both films really. There are funny scenes throughout the whole of *StH*, but *DP* had me laughing much harder at times.


[04-Mar-20 12:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I must note though that *DP*'s plot had me confused at times, particularly with regards to why the main character could talk to Pikachu in particular, and why he was the only Pokemon to speak in more than just the generic sounds that they make in the game.


[04-Mar-20 12:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*StH* at least takes the time explain things, especially if they are different to the source material.


[04-Mar-20 12:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Overall, I think that the success we from *DP* has allowed *StH* to flourish.


[04-Mar-20 12:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*StH* perfected the standard which was created last year by *DP*.


[04-Mar-20 12:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whilst its not free from defect, I have given *StH* ten out of ten because it is consistently a really good movie.


[04-Mar-20 12:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As for *DP*, its flaws are often balanced out by the moments of brilliance. It is often the better of the two movies, but its imperfections are much more noticeable and as such it can only get an 8/10 from me.


[04-Mar-20 12:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The future for Video Game based movies looks really bright if this streak can continue.


[04-Mar-20 12:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think that a sequel for *DP* is unlikely given the way which that story wrapped up, but *StH* will almost certainly get a sequel, especially given the box office success it has seen the past few weeks.


[04-Mar-20 12:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I thank you all for tuning in to this week's episode of *tbyrn's Movies*.

Where a club existed previously, it has been carried across so that logos are consistent (some adjustments have been made for balancing reasons).

Hello and welcome to the Australiasim Soccer League preseason prediction show.


[16-May-20 05:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
20 Teams from across Australia (and abroad) will compete in a 19 match season to see who is the best.


[16-May-20 05:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
5 teams from the former A-League will continue their footballing journey in the new ASL.


[16-May-20 05:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
A further 13 teams step up from other leagues to join them, including one from New Zealand, and another from Fiji.


[16-May-20 05:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Finally, two new teams have been formed to complete the field.


[16-May-20 05:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As one would imagine, the five former A-League teams dominate the betting market for this season, with Sydney FC hot favourite to win.


[16-May-20 05:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Melbourne City, Adelaide United, Newcastle Jets and Central Coast Mariners should provide them some challenge however, and one assumes that its a fairly open race between these five.


[16-May-20 05:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Peninsula Eagles are the higher rated new comer, and will be a cross town rival for the Mariners.


[16-May-20 05:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Darwin Larrakins however are not expected to fare as well however it is expected that they should not be the ones to receive the wooden spoon.


[16-May-20 05:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The two international teams, of Ba FC and Auckland Rangers will be in a fight with Whitsunday Miners to avoid that fate.


[16-May-20 05:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Full betting odds are shown below.

well you're getting one we dont care if it sucks


[02-Jul-20 04:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
we have a bunch of new contestants to "who wants to be a politician"


[02-Jul-20 04:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
that means we've dragged Skytony Orange out of his box to do some analysing


[02-Jul-20 04:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This is his analysis


[02-Jul-20 04:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Cowper


[02-Jul-20 04:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Cowper sees a 4 horse race, with the incumbent PM taking on a challenger from the SDP, SAlt and an independent.


[02-Jul-20 04:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Despite this seat being won with 62% of the vote last election, this seat sits on a knife-edge.


[02-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We are tentatively leaning LNP with this seat but its gonna be close.


[02-Jul-20 04:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moncrieff


[02-Jul-20 04:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moncrieff sees a straight up fight between the incumbent Duck of the LNP and GoatBoy of the SDP.


[02-Jul-20 04:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
GoatBoy has campaigned well but the LNP look like they will hang on here.


[02-Jul-20 04:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Pearce


[02-Jul-20 04:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Incumbent SDP member NGSpy comes up against RMSteve of the LNP


[02-Jul-20 04:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
NG won this seat quite comprehensively last term.


[02-Jul-20 04:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We expect the SDP to be triumphant again here, although the margin will narrow.


[02-Jul-20 04:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Sydney


[02-Jul-20 04:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Sydney sees a three way fight between Mrcri of the LNP, batko of SAlt, and Rommel the Independent.


[02-Jul-20 04:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Former LNP leader Riley is the incumbent here, but following a lot of hard work by Rommel has fled the seat fearing for his own career's safety.


[02-Jul-20 04:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As a result of losing the incumbent MP the LNP voters too have fled the party, Rommel should waltz back into parliament quite easily.


[02-Jul-20 04:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Hotham


[02-Jul-20 04:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Hotham is another seat where the incumbent is not returning.


[02-Jul-20 04:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Deladi0 of the Democrats will be joined by Polteaghost of the SDP and Umatbru of the LNP.


[02-Jul-20 04:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Notably, UMATBRU FOR SENATE won't happen this election.

{Reactions}
üò¢ 

[02-Jul-20 04:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, UMATBRU FOR HOTHAM is quite likely.


[02-Jul-20 04:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Robertson


[02-Jul-20 04:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Roberston sees a straight rematch between the two candidates from the last election, Jayden and WW.


[02-Jul-20 05:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This seat is going to be very, very close.


[02-Jul-20 05:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Only a handful of ballots in it.


[02-Jul-20 05:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Our tip is Jayden to win, but it could go either way.


[02-Jul-20 05:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Denison


[02-Jul-20 05:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Independent MP Dyljam will do battle with pacman of the LNP this election.


[02-Jul-20 05:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We expect Dyljam to retain his seat.


[02-Jul-20 05:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Lingiari


[02-Jul-20 05:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This seat sees Walter_heisenberg of the LNP take on DirtySaiyan, running as an Indy.


[02-Jul-20 05:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This seat too looks pretty close


[02-Jul-20 05:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But I think the LNP may pull ahead here.


[02-Jul-20 05:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Mayo


[02-Jul-20 05:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
SnecBoi of the CLP will hope to retain their seat here against Kisakuwu of the LNP.


[02-Jul-20 05:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This looks most likely.


[02-Jul-20 05:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Capricornia


[02-Jul-20 05:05 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This seat sees where the former PM Riley ran off to from Sydney.


[02-Jul-20 05:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whilst Queensland can often be good for the LNP, we here at Sky are interested to see if the country Queensland seat will accept a City slicker from down south.


[02-Jul-20 05:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
His opposition are the incumbent ARTB, and CLP candidate Aya.


[02-Jul-20 05:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
From what we can gather Riley is looking good to take this seat but ARTB is not out of it yet.


[02-Jul-20 05:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Brisbane


[02-Jul-20 05:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Crossing now into the Queensland Capital, PineappleCrusher of the LNP will be against Flarelia of the SDP.


[02-Jul-20 05:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We expect Brisbane to go blue this election.


[02-Jul-20 05:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Nicholls


[02-Jul-20 05:11 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Nichols sees Horror for the LNP take on EdenHopeStan


[02-Jul-20 05:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Incumbent MP showstealer was scheduled to be running however he has sadly dropped out last minute.


[02-Jul-20 05:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It appears that Horror will take this seat for the LNP.


[02-Jul-20 05:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Cunningham


[02-Jul-20 05:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This seat sees our final 3 horse race.


[02-Jul-20 05:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I won't dwell on it too long as the incumbent LNP MP should be returned easily.


[02-Jul-20 05:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Melbourne


[02-Jul-20 05:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Incumbent MP NeatSaucer will crush UrquartTarkin of the LNP.


[02-Jul-20 05:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Canberra


[02-Jul-20 05:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The final seat brings us back to the Capital.


[02-Jul-20 05:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Youmaton of the SDP squares up once again against BloodyChrome.


[02-Jul-20 05:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Youma has been a long term fighter for the territory, championing the push for ACT Statehood.


[02-Jul-20 05:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However, their efforts won't be rewarded, as BloodyChrome will be returned to the seat.


[02-Jul-20 05:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And so that wraps up the house seats.


[02-Jul-20 05:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
To repeat, this is our totals.

this bill called for students or "school administrators", whatever that means, to be publicly executed if they made a transphobic comment.

or why it had to be in the bill as 'cuddly funtimes' as if it knew it was doing something wrong but tried to hide it.

Well Griffo, lets play this out.


[28-Feb-21 03:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If I were attempting to suffocate your opinions, I wouldn't rebroadcast them on national TV, would I?


[28-Feb-21 03:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think not.


[28-Feb-21 03:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If Griffo genuinely believes that I was suffocating his opinions, then he is nothing more than a bumbling idiot and does not have the capability of leading this country.


[28-Feb-21 03:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We received no response from the Liberals as to if they would be abandoning the Nationals following this farce.


[28-Feb-21 03:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
On the last program we also discussed Kate's absence during a bill which they had sponsored.


[28-Feb-21 03:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As it transpired, they did not vote for two whole weeks.


[28-Feb-21 03:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
TWO WEEKS


[28-Feb-21 03:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
they missed so much that they received a warning, after which they finally returned.


[28-Feb-21 03:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
An MP should not need a warning to appear to do their job


[28-Feb-21 03:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If a worker went awol for two weeks they would have almost certainly been fired.


[28-Feb-21 03:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Plain and simple.


[28-Feb-21 03:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The fact that Kate has not had that fate befall them is a real shame and its disappointing that this is how the system operates.


[28-Feb-21 03:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If they had have taken leave, then thats fine.


[28-Feb-21 03:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But they didnt.


[28-Feb-21 03:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moncrieff, you know what to do when the time comes.


[28-Feb-21 03:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Any way we shall move on to today's topics.


[28-Feb-21 03:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In particular, I want to look at house bill 1917.


[28-Feb-21 03:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This bill if passed will merge the ABC and SBS.


[28-Feb-21 03:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, as a direct competitor of these items, I should be jumping for joy.


[28-Feb-21 03:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Because a merger of the ABC and SBS will cripple them


[28-Feb-21 03:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But I'm not.


[28-Feb-21 03:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This is not a good thing.


[28-Feb-21 03:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The ABC and SBS provide critical and crucial services across Australia and a merger to them will ruin their capability to deliver them.


[28-Feb-21 03:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The ABC and SBS have forever been a punching bag for politicians to hit whenever they want a bit of cash to use for a different project.


[28-Feb-21 03:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The people in rural australia or with limited English skills will suffer from this change.


[28-Feb-21 03:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The people who live in disaster zones will suffer from this


[28-Feb-21 03:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Australia will suffer from this.


[28-Feb-21 03:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I don't know how more categorically I can put that fact.


[28-Feb-21 03:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Australia will suffer, solely so the Government can make $150 million.


[28-Feb-21 03:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In the grand scheme of things, thats not much.


[28-Feb-21 03:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This is not a worth while transaction.


[28-Feb-21 03:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Nothing is worth a person's life during times of crisis.


[28-Feb-21 03:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Although according to the Government, its worth $150 million.


[28-Feb-21 03:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Congratulations Australia, we all have a dollar price on our heads.


[28-Feb-21 03:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But thats not the worst of it.


[28-Feb-21 03:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Griffo accused me of attempting to suffocate his freedom of speech.


[28-Feb-21 03:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yet he thinks its ok to suffocate the country's free speech.


[28-Feb-21 03:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For the price of $150 million.


[28-Feb-21 03:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For $5.91 per person.

Hello Australia!

[25-Mar-21 10:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now because we here at Sky News rely on unpaid interns they haven't given me the changes in figures since the last poll.


[25-Mar-21 10:51 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But nonetheless these figures are intriguing.


[25-Mar-21 10:51 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The Nats and Libs together only command 30% of the voters.


[25-Mar-21 10:51 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
When the next election comes, thats not going to end well.


[25-Mar-21 10:53 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think the Liberals losing their leader who became an Independent has affected this however.


[25-Mar-21 10:54 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But that still doesn't win voters back.


[25-Mar-21 10:54 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They have a lot of ground to cover if they want to hold the government next term.


[25-Mar-21 10:56 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The real surprise to though is that no party has broken the 20% barrier in this poll.


[25-Mar-21 10:56 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Australian politics are incredibly fractured right now and no party has real control.


[25-Mar-21 10:57 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If anyone wants to make a play to become the biggest party, now is a good time to do it.


[25-Mar-21 10:58 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This period also saw the creation of the Goat Party.


[25-Mar-21 10:59 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I feel like their 1.3% in the poll will be a bit disheartening for them however.


[25-Mar-21 11:00 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Obviously, they will work on growing that over time but its a long way from there.


[25-Mar-21 11:01 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now there was one more poll which I didn't share with you all yet which is the new media poll.


[25-Mar-21 11:01 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yes, we actually have some viewership figures to share today.


[25-Mar-21 11:02 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
We here at Sky News have 2.6% of all Australians watching us

[29-Mar-21 07:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Good evening everyone


[29-Mar-21 07:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Tonight I bring another rant straight out of the "what on earth" files.


[29-Mar-21 07:04 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The focus of my discussion tonight is Riley8583.


[29-Mar-21 07:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley has been around the political game for quite some time, and was prime minister for nearly two months last year.


[29-Mar-21 07:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley has been a big player in right wing circles for quite some time and has a long established career.


[29-Mar-21 07:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And yet, his recent decisions have made them look like an utter fool.


[29-Mar-21 07:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley's career has mostly been spent bouncing around the Libs and the Nats, depending on which party was active at that time, but generally one can say that Riley's most prominent party is the Nationals.


[29-Mar-21 07:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
However recently Riley took a shock move away from politics, and joined the High Court


[29-Mar-21 07:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
... for a couple of weeks before resigning and returning to politics, this time leading a new initiative called "RebuildAustralia Org".


[29-Mar-21 07:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now I won't knock the new initiative, as homelessness is a legitimate issue and it seems that Riley has both done their homework and become very passionate about that issue.


[29-Mar-21 07:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But, what I will knock is the timing of this all, and the way in which this has all occurred.


[29-Mar-21 07:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley in this act has made a mockery of the bench, by being added and then leaving in basically no time at all.


[29-Mar-21 07:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It reflects poorly on the court, on Riley, and on the Government.


[29-Mar-21 07:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Surely they would have asked "do you still plan on running at the next available by-election"?


[29-Mar-21 07:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway, Riley's return also comes with massive shade being thrown at the National Party.


[29-Mar-21 07:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
To quote directly, Riley claims that they will "deliver a plan that will put Sydney back on track after its chaotic representation, if you can call it that, under the Nationals".


[29-Mar-21 07:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I absolutely love this quote from Riley.


[29-Mar-21 07:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
From August 2019 to March 2020, Riley was the MP for Sydney, as a Nationals member.


[29-Mar-21 07:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Until July of that year, RIley was still the MP but now in the combined LNP.


[29-Mar-21 07:22 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Sydney was then held by independents until the most recent election where arles2464 won it back for the Nats.


[29-Mar-21 07:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley meanwhile would spend a short stint in Moncrieff as MP, also for the Nats.


[29-Mar-21 07:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley, the Nats and Sydney are all intertwined.


[29-Mar-21 07:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The three cannot be seperated.


[29-Mar-21 07:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And yet, Riley claims that Sydney has had "chaotic representation [...] under the Nationals".


[29-Mar-21 07:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Congratulations Riley, you just trashed your own previous work as MP for Sydney.


[29-Mar-21 07:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And now, Riley plans on retaking that very seat at the upcoming Sydney by-election


[29-Mar-21 07:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
A website in his name was launched to help promote this and a link for it has been advertised around.


[29-Mar-21 07:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But when one follows the link to the website, one is greeted with a 404 error.


[29-Mar-21 07:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Congratulations Riley, you failed to launch your website correctly.


[29-Mar-21 07:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think to put this all in short, Riley is a goldfish.


[29-Mar-21 07:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
He can't remember who he has his biggest history with, and he can't remember to launch a website before advertising it.


[29-Mar-21 07:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley, incase you've forgotten this too, the people of Sydney won't elect a goldfish.


[29-Mar-21 07:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They'll pick someone better.


[29-Mar-21 07:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
It most certainly won't be you.


[29-Mar-21 07:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In other news today I am announcing my official return to politics.


[29-Mar-21 07:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I am standing at the Moncrieff by-election.

Fans of the show will remember my earlier comments about how the people of Moncrieff deserve better than the MP they had.


[29-Mar-21 07:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well, now is their opportunity.


[29-Mar-21 07:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Do I profess to be perfect? No. I mean, I threw coal at the speaker's chair all those years ago.


[29-Mar-21 07:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But, I am a hard battler and a work horse.


[29-Mar-21 07:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I have proven that in my previous time in parliament.


[29-Mar-21 07:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I hope the people of Moncrieff put their faith in me, and in return I will use that faith and bring the fight to Canberra for them in a way they haven't had recently.


[29-Mar-21 07:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Good night all.

[03-Apr-21 06:46 PM] RookWilt#6643
I would agree with, you both ran a good campaign


[03-Apr-21 06:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
i need to pull like 35% on my own


[03-Apr-21 06:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
i dont think ive done that


[03-Apr-21 06:46 PM] RookWilt#6643
Now as you both know I was a former candidate but had to pull out due to personal and health issues


[03-Apr-21 06:47 PM] RookWilt#6643
But I'm proud of the campaign Zak has ran, I would say it was one of ay uh high quality

My guess is obv going to be a race between be the ADP and SDP


[03-Apr-21 06:48 PM] Zak#6496
I think this episode is rated M for Moncrieff


[03-Apr-21 06:48 PM] RookWilt#6643
Just depending on how preferences flow


[03-Apr-21 06:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
yeag its down to ADP vs SDP


[03-Apr-21 06:48 PM] RookWilt#6643
This is going to be a very tight race


[03-Apr-21 06:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
i think I come third, then umatbru


[03-Apr-21 06:48 PM] RookWilt#6643
as both SDP and ADP are polling well


[03-Apr-21 06:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Everybody loves a good bit of speculation! Here you will be able to go through and indicate who you think is going to win in the Sydney and Moncrieff By-Elections

Well hello everyone!


[15-Apr-21 05:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Its been a big couple of weeks so lets try and unwind that time.


[15-Apr-21 06:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Lets start with the recent polling from the ABC.


[15-Apr-21 06:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
SDP: 19.17% (-0.39%)
ADP: 17.20% (+1.15%)
CLP: 14.23% (-0.73%)
GLP: 13.56% (+1.05%)
NAT: 12.79% (-0.64%)
LPA: 7.10% (-0.99%)
GOAT: 2.5% (-)
IND/OTH: 13.46% (+0.58%)


[15-Apr-21 06:01 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If we add these up, this is 19.89% for the Government, or 26.45% for the Government + their confidence and supply partner


[15-Apr-21 06:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Admittedly, this doesn't include Riley, who is some portion of the Independent figure.


[15-Apr-21 06:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Nonetheless, the Government has less than 30% of the current polling.


[15-Apr-21 06:02 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That has to be the saddest effort I have seen from a Government.

[15-Apr-21 06:09 PM] RookWilt#6643
But anyway, this means the Government has not only failed to get through its agenda, but has also, by westminster tradition, lost the confidence of the house.


[15-Apr-21 06:09 PM] RookWilt#6643
Question is now, what happens next


[15-Apr-21 06:10 PM] RookWilt#6643

If you want my hot tip, I'll be PM.

[15-Apr-21 06:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[15-Apr-21 06:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
*the oddsometer is no longer on screen*


[15-Apr-21 06:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Also why did the font suddenly double


[15-Apr-21 06:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway, its obvious that no one will win the next election.


[15-Apr-21 06:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moving on.


[15-Apr-21 06:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There is one other reason to take this Government out back


[15-Apr-21 06:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And that is its part time PM.


[15-Apr-21 06:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As established, their name is now Emperor Griffo.


[15-Apr-21 06:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Emperor Griffo had another one of his crazy moments in Question Time today.


[15-Apr-21 06:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
To cut it down so that we're not here till next week, I'll summarise.


[15-Apr-21 06:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Emperor Griffo claims that lowering business taxes will lead to more compliance in paying their taxes.


[15-Apr-21 06:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
When asked to present evidence, the Emperor presented this document https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp0807.pdf


[15-Apr-21 06:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
My favourite part is the first footnote to the document.


[15-Apr-21 06:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Allow me to quote the relevant statement, then the footnote.


[15-Apr-21 06:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"To illustrate the potential effects of tax rate cuts on tax revenues consider the example of Russia. Russia introduced a flat 13 percent personal income tax rate, replacing the three tiered, 12, 20 and 30 percent previous rates (as detailed in Ivanova, Keen and Klemm, 2005). The tax exempt income was also increased, further decreasing the tax burden. Considering social tax reforms enacted at the same time, tax rates were cut substantially for most taxpayers. However, personal income tax (PIT) revenues have increased significantly: 46 percent in nominal and 26 percent real terms during the next year. Even more interesting PIT revenues have increased from 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent of GDP ‚Äî a more than 20 percent increase relative to GDP. PIT revenues continued to increase to 3.3 percent during the next year, representing a further 14% gain relative to GDP. Furthermore, even official estimates showed increased tax compliance."


[15-Apr-21 06:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Seems pretty legit right?


[15-Apr-21 06:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now for the footnote.


[15-Apr-21 06:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"On one hand, those affected by the tax rate cuts (higher income taxpayers) improved their compliance, which is consistent with our model. On the other hand, Ivanova, Keen and Klemm (2005) also found that the unaffected had significant salary increases and the observed compliance
increase does not explain revenue increase. However, in the light of this model, it would worth further studies to disentangle effects of higher wages from those of higher reported wages and higher compliance. Higher reported wages might be a consequence of unobserved increase in
compliance. In any case, this model is not an empirical evaluation of what has happened in Russia, but a general theoretical exploration of tax rate cuts."


[15-Apr-21 06:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So the Government presents evidence to show why lowering taxes leads to better tax paying rates, only for the evidence to discredit that finding and state not to use it.


[15-Apr-21 06:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I love it.


[15-Apr-21 06:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Emperor Griffo has officially gone nuts.


[15-Apr-21 06:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I would tell Australia they were mad to vote for him and that they shouldn't next time around, but according to the polls that train left months ago, next stop - the metaphorical glue factory.


[15-Apr-21 06:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[15-Apr-21 06:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Also to come out of question time was the fact that the Member for Melbourne is a racist

[15-Apr-21 06:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Or at least, a diet one.


[15-Apr-21 06:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yes, the member was seen drinking from a can of "diet racism".


[15-Apr-21 06:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Clearly, the member is racist.


[15-Apr-21 06:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Finally i wanted to take note that we are now up to 4.4% in the media poll.


[15-Apr-21 06:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

If your friends try to turn the tv off of sky, then destroy their remote and ensure they cant turn off the tv.

[26-Apr-21 07:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Hello and welcome to the show!


[26-Apr-21 07:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I would say that tonights episode is a special feature episode


[26-Apr-21 07:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but given the topic its just a regular one


[26-Apr-21 07:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
because once again, I'm here talking about known politician Riley


[26-Apr-21 07:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I feel like a broken record


[26-Apr-21 07:14 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but here we are anyway


[26-Apr-21 07:15 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
When we last looked at Riley, he was an Independent MP, who entered parliament following a dramatic win in Sydney.


[26-Apr-21 07:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But it was just before that win that I did a full feature on him.


[26-Apr-21 07:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Let me just play some Highlights of that film.


[26-Apr-21 07:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"Riley's career has mostly been spent bouncing around the Libs and the Nats, depending on which party was active at that time, but generally one can say that Riley's most prominent party is the Nationals."


[26-Apr-21 07:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"Riley's return also comes with massive shade being thrown at the National Party. To quote directly, Riley claims that they will "deliver a plan that will put Sydney back on track after its chaotic representation, if you can call it that, under the Nationals".

I absolutely love this quote from Riley. From August 2019 to March 2020, Riley was the MP for Sydney, as a Nationals member."


[26-Apr-21 07:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"Riley, the Nats and Sydney are all intertwined. The three cannot be seperated. And yet, Riley claims that Sydney has had "chaotic representation [...] under the Nationals". Congratulations Riley, you just trashed your own previous work as MP for Sydney."


[26-Apr-21 07:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"Riley is a goldfish."


[26-Apr-21 07:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
such good tapes


[26-Apr-21 07:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But since then Riley announced that he was rejoining the National Party.


[26-Apr-21 07:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If I were funny, I'd make a joke about how people complain about society yet choose to live in one.


[26-Apr-21 07:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But I'm not.


[26-Apr-21 07:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway now lets just roll the tapes of Riley saying stuff that contradicts himself whilst I sit here trying not to die from the irony


[26-Apr-21 07:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"I stand here today to announce that I am contesting the QLD senate!

How good is that!

The people of Queensland need a strong representative in the senate;"


[26-Apr-21 07:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"What we do not need is more salesmen selling their political limbo, but instead, a fighter, a person who is connected with the community, someone that can stand up for you on all fronts."


[26-Apr-21 07:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"We out here in the regions don‚Äôt want to be told what to do by the inner city latte sipping socialists,"


[26-Apr-21 07:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"If you want change, support the National Party this election, if you want to have good representation, vote for us."


[26-Apr-21 07:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"To the farmers in regional and rural Queensland, I am here and ready to fight for you"


[26-Apr-21 07:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"If you want an honest hardworking Senator, vote 1 Riley8583"

{Reactions}
no 

[26-Apr-21 07:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I honestly can't believe that an "honest hardworking Senator [candidate]" said this


[26-Apr-21 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For those who want some more context, let me explain this hot mess.


[26-Apr-21 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley has for the last month been the MP for Sydney.


[26-Apr-21 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The biggest city in the country


[26-Apr-21 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the least rural seat possible


[26-Apr-21 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
yet he claims to be a rural


[26-Apr-21 07:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
he says that the country should not be run by inner city latte sipping socialists


[26-Apr-21 07:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
when his most recent role was being the mp for the inner city latte sipping socialists


[26-Apr-21 07:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
He says how good the nats are, after spending the last month shitcanning them at every occasion.


[26-Apr-21 07:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
An honest politician, eh Riley?


[26-Apr-21 07:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You're nothing but a scam mate.


[26-Apr-21 07:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"How good is that!"


[26-Apr-21 07:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And the thing that Riley also spoke about was his support for coal.


[26-Apr-21 07:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, I can't sit here and say how backwards is he in this regard, not when this clip has so many views on the internet:

[26-Apr-21 07:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and that this copypasta exists on the internet (WHICH I DID NOT WRITE OR SAY FYI) "Our Adani who art in Queensland, hallowed be thy name. Thy mines will come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Queensland. Give us this day our daily coal; and forgive us our carbon tax, as we forgive those who carbon tax us; and lead us not into sustainable energy, but deliver us from energy shortages."


[26-Apr-21 07:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but


[26-Apr-21 07:46 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Riley clearly does need to get with the times.


[26-Apr-21 07:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In my final act as a politician 2 years ago, I helped form a government with a key policy of transitioning away from Coal


[26-Apr-21 07:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Most importantly, this transition included a responsible transition of these workers


[26-Apr-21 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In effect, there are no coal miners left Riley, they have all been given new jobs in the solar farms


[26-Apr-21 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
You would have known that Riley, if you had have left Sydney for once... oh wait you did. You spent time as MP for Moncrieff too!


[26-Apr-21 07:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But you don't care about that as an Honest hardworking senator right Riley? one who wont back down from a fight?


[26-Apr-21 07:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
oh wait you abandoned Sydney for an easier gig as a Senator.


[26-Apr-21 07:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Coward.


[26-Apr-21 07:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Now I know all of you are listening to Requestival on Triple J however I still have bills to pay and lights to keep on so I've been dragged into the studio to make a show.


[10-May-21 07:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So get your arses in front of the TV and watch me scream about some nonsense for a bit.


[10-May-21 07:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Tonight, I'm going to show how prompt we are with our topics and talk about the last General Election


[10-May-21 07:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For those out of the loop, the results were as follows: For the house; SDP 5 and ADP 3 forming government, with GLP 4 creating opposition. IND 1 CLP 1 and LIB 1 form the cross bench


[10-May-21 07:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
In the senate, SDP 1, GLP 1, NAT 2 to make SDP 1 ADP 1 for the government, GLP 2 for the opposition, CLP 1 NAT 3 for the cross bench.


[10-May-21 07:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
There were so many story lines that came out of this election and I'll run few several of these now.


[10-May-21 07:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll start in Nicholls, which probably drew the biggest shock of the night.


[10-May-21 07:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This seat saw the Leader of the Opposition go up against a co-leader of the GLP.


[10-May-21 07:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This was always going to be a big fight and it was model-kyosanto who pulled through over Matthias_Caesar.


[10-May-21 07:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Many, myself included, are still rather confused by why Matt made the move to Nicholls.


[10-May-21 07:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
To me, at least, if you have a seat that you have carved out for yourself, you don't move to a different seat.


[10-May-21 07:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Still, I'm not Matt, and I'm still in parliament.


[10-May-21 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Speaking of myself we may as well go to Moncrieff, where I held off a strong challenge from the CLP's Lady_Aya to retain the seat and be the nation's only Independent MP.


[10-May-21 07:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The CLP had a fairly up and down election on the whole.


[10-May-21 07:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They did manage to pick up Lingiari, but didn't really make much ground elsewhere.


[10-May-21 07:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
On the Election Results stream, Gregor spoke about how they would keep fighting for the rural people of the country.


[10-May-21 07:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
This I think is admirable and anyone who fights for the people of the regions knows how tough they do it out there.


[10-May-21 07:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But, I think the CLP need to reassess why they haven't had any bigger success.


[10-May-21 07:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
As a rural party, especially of their age, they should be able to sweep seats like Lingiari, Cowper, Nicholls, Capricornia, Mayo and Pearce.


[10-May-21 07:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They won Lingiari, got 45.4% tpp in Robertson, 46% in Mayo but in the other seats they did quite poorly.


[10-May-21 07:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Instead, they put a lot of resources into attempting to reclaim Moncrieff.


[10-May-21 07:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whilst they had previously held this seat, it seems odd that such a rural party would fight so hard to be the MP for the Gold Coast and Ipswich, two very non-rural areas.


[10-May-21 07:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Those resources could surely have been better used to target a more rural seat and win either Robertson or Mayo or improve their position in seats like Capricornia where their base really should be.


[10-May-21 07:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I really think the CLP should have done better, and its a shame for their supporters that the plans for the future of the CLP doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon.


[10-May-21 07:56 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Next lets focus on Cowper.


[10-May-21 07:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Cowper was won quite comprehensively by mikiboss of the SDP, with no decent challenge pressed by anyone else.


[10-May-21 07:58 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But I want to focus on what is missing from Cowper, and that is a strong Nationals threat.


[10-May-21 07:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
With Kisakuwu only able to pull 5.14% of the vote, the days of Griffo seem to be very long gone.


[10-May-21 08:03 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And this was the story of the night for the Nats in the House, while they contested all but one seat, they only got 3 candidates into the 2pp, but 2 of those were heads up contests, and the other they still only got to 20% after preferences.


[10-May-21 08:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Now, they will sure tell you that this was entirely tactical


[10-May-21 08:06 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but this has to have been a bad move.


[10-May-21 08:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
They pulled all their MPs and big candidates out of the house and into the Senate, in a play to control it.


[10-May-21 08:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But in doing so they only got 2 senate seats, which with their one that they had from last term leaves them short to control the house of review.


[10-May-21 08:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So, plan failed.


[10-May-21 08:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The right wing in general seems in shambles now, with just two Liberals contesting the house. That said they will retain Brisbane with GenericCerealHere continuing to ride his wave of popularity in the city.


[10-May-21 08:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Moving now to the parties who did win big, the ADP, the GLP and the SDP.


[10-May-21 08:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well, I'm probably going to get complaints about saying the ADP won big given their leader killed themselves politically


[10-May-21 08:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but they won three seats and got into goverment


[10-May-21 08:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
thats pretty good


[10-May-21 08:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
even if it meant you lost the most important member.


[10-May-21 08:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But it wasnt long ago we were talking about the SDP, lead by a Matt, who won big but lost their leader on the night.


[10-May-21 08:23 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But yes they didn't win big, big.


[10-May-21 08:24 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway they and the SDP cobbled together a government when many expected it to be SDP and GLP doing so.


[10-May-21 08:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
But the GLP missed out and the ADP picked up.


[10-May-21 08:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That said, it wasn't an open and shut deal for the SDP, there was - at least for a brief moment - a potential anti-SDP government forming however not all of those involved could agree to do it.


[10-May-21 08:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The GLP now take opposition after growing to 4 seats.


[10-May-21 08:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And then of course there's the SDP at 5.


[10-May-21 08:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I don't really have much to say about those parties, they had good success at the election and theres no comments that i could make that would be relevant.


[10-May-21 08:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So i guess thats the end of the show tonight.

[21-Jul-21 08:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Yes it sounds contradictory but its like the days of old


[21-Jul-21 08:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
instead of a bunch of hacks, you get a group of people who can all debate with each other but do so without it meaning that general support is lost


[21-Jul-21 08:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
All I must say is, why didn't I think of that?

GRN 21 (-8) SDP 19 (+2) LPA 18 (-10) CLP 13 (-3) IND/OTH 11 (+1) TIG 9 (-) GOAT (-)


[08-Aug-21 08:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think that basically everyone will be disappointed


[08-Aug-21 08:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
no one has any control


[08-Aug-21 08:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and all we know is that TIG hasn't done what they hoped for


[08-Aug-21 08:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[11-Aug-21 11:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Hi all


[11-Aug-21 11:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
this is going to be a very short broadcast


[11-Aug-21 11:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll get to the point


[11-Aug-21 11:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
there is a strong push to replace the high court because they are all political retirees


[11-Aug-21 11:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
yes, they are all that


[11-Aug-21 11:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
no disputes here


[11-Aug-21 11:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but what will be different if we boot them?


[11-Aug-21 11:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The only people willing to be justices are said political retirees


[11-Aug-21 11:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
if this truely about getting rid of old dead wood and bringing in new legal minds, we need to know who the possible replacements are


[11-Aug-21 11:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
else this just screams of "the bench has people we don't like".


[11-Aug-21 11:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Australia doesnt have a court like the US


[11-Aug-21 11:50 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
we, in theory at least, shouldn't be stacking it


[11-Aug-21 11:51 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and on that same premise, we shouldnt be having a tantrum when it is filled with tobys


[11-Aug-21 11:52 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
to those who really want a new bench, I have one request - think about what you are doing and why you are doing it. Is it to really make the bench better for all, or better for you?


[11-Aug-21 11:52 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[05-Oct-21 09:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Well good morning folks its Mayo by-election week


[05-Oct-21 09:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
wooooooooooooooo


[05-Oct-21 09:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
And to start off the week we actually have a poll from the electorate


[05-Oct-21 09:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That poll reads as follows


[05-Oct-21 09:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Aussie-Parliament-RP (Greens): 38.8%
SurfingNooty1 (Sensible Team): 16.8%
cutepattern1098 (SDP): 15.1%
MLastCelebration (Liberal Democrats): 9.9%
socialistsarah (Commonwealth): 9.8%
JosephTheEmu (Country Labor): 9.6%


[05-Oct-21 09:32 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whilst the campaign has a long way to go, it seems pretty safe to say that Aussie-Parliament-RP is in a really comfortable position


[05-Oct-21 09:33 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
with a 22% lead it appears that the long term politician will return to parliament this week.


[05-Oct-21 09:34 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That said the race for second place is wide open, with just 7.2% covering the rest of the field


[05-Oct-21 09:35 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
If the Greens can't capitalise on their lead and there is a strong preference flow against them, any of these candidates could steal the win


[05-Oct-21 09:35 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
So despite the strong lead, theres enough margin that it could potentially be run down


[05-Oct-21 09:37 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
socialistsarah from the Commonwealth party has already started their campaign, with a rally being held in the centre north of Adelaide.


[05-Oct-21 09:38 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

If the campaign from the Commonwealth candidate can remain strong like their start, then second place is easily claimable.


[05-Oct-21 09:39 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That said, I do think that the Greens should take the win here provided that Aussie-Parliament-RP makes their appearances in public.

[19-Oct-21 01:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm back on in the studio for the first time in ages


[19-Oct-21 01:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I apologise to all those who were watching the Sky News logo float around hoping it would hit the corner of the screen


[19-Oct-21 01:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I assure you once this broadcast is over we will return to that


[19-Oct-21 01:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway I was headed down the street on the way to the studio today to have a script writing meeting when I was stopped on the street by a lady


[19-Oct-21 01:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
She looked up at me and said "you're that tbyrn idiot who screams a lot on the tele and makes dumb statements in parliament right?"


[19-Oct-21 01:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
After she berated me a bit more for some recent gaffs in the chamber she asked if I had heard about the recent rebranding of the SDP.


[19-Oct-21 01:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I told her I hadn't and asked what was going on.


[19-Oct-21 01:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
She said "they've gone and turned themselves into the ALP again!"


[19-Oct-21 01:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
She was absolutely mortified.


[19-Oct-21 01:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"You know I've been voting for the SDP for quite some time now as I agree with most of their policies, but I can't stand the fact that they've decided that they need to go back to an old failed brand!"


[19-Oct-21 01:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"I reckon you should run a skit about how the ALP are worse then the pain of going into labour, I'm sure that would win some ratings", she said.


[19-Oct-21 01:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Whilst I enjoyed the pun I told her that I probably shouldn't do that as the censors might not like that one.


[19-Oct-21 01:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Disgruntled, she turned to leave. "The sensors don't like anything these days!", she exclaimed.


[19-Oct-21 01:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Before she left though she said that she wouldn't be supporting the rebranded party, and that she might consider "the bunch of wankers [that I am] with, can't be much worse than the ALP."


[19-Oct-21 01:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Anyway I thought I might share that story on the air today since it was rather unique.


[19-Oct-21 01:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Us pollies never really do a good enough job of getting the average person's view on all these games we play.


[19-Oct-21 01:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
That wraps up the show, thanks for watching.


[19-Oct-21 01:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
