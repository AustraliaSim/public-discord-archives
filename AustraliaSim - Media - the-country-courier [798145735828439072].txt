The Country Courier can confirm that the Country Labor Party is currently helping lead the Government into releasing a joint statement with the Pacific Islands Forum on the matter of vaccine nationalism.


[10-Mar-21 11:53 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Statement aims to set out a few strong objectives for the Pacific Islands Forum as a whole and to emphasize the position


[10-Mar-21 11:53 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Whether such negotiations will prove successful will be a matter of time


[10-Mar-21 11:56 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Meanwhile, the Country Labor Party leader and many members have also slammed their Government partners in the Liberal Party on their conduct with Health Spokesperson model-frod stating "Quite frankly disgraceful to be coming from the Liberal Party which leaves the capabilities of the Prime Minister to lead in serious question. The CLP and Government parties with brains will be continuing to enforce a strong stance on the issue and proper action can be expected."

Here's your fun fact for today


[28-May-21 01:03 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**FUN FACT**

Did you know that Fijian Ratu, to distinguish rank, would frequently wear turbans and wield flyswatters in battle and outside of battle? They would commonly also use spears to as a common form of weaponry to distinguish from the clubs wielded by others in their Mataqali or Yavusa!


[28-May-21 01:04 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
A good example is Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa, the father of the first and only Tui Viti who was Fijian!

[28-May-21 05:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Flag of Fiji as it stands is a truly gorgeous symbol. The blue representing the wide pacific, the depictions of our hope for peace and what we're known for. Sugar Cane, A Coconut Palm Tree, Peace and Bananas! The true Fijian way of life!


[28-May-21 05:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Of course, I believe the flag would be better without the Union Jack or the British Lion on it and so the flag which is otherwise a 12/10 must be brought down to a 10/10 until reform


[28-May-21 05:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
However, we're not here to gush over the sheer majesty of the flag of Viti


[28-May-21 05:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We're here to review the alternative proposals


[28-May-21 05:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Firstly, let us quickly mention a few highlights prior to the current alternative proposals


[28-May-21 05:17 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The current Presidential Flag is quite simply beautiful and clearly shows that there is a direction to place a beautiful Fijian Drua or Camakau within the flag of Fiji and our standard Coat of Arms

**Fijian Presidential Flag: 10/10**


[28-May-21 05:18 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Flag of the Kingdom of Fiji is kinda basic, doesn't really appeal to me and seems more like the type of flag which would be flown in an Eastern European country rather than Fiji. However, props to the adoption of the peace dove and the first usages of the distinctive Fijian blue.

**Kingdom of Fiji Flag: 3/10**


[28-May-21 05:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Confederacy of the Independent Kingdoms of Fiji was literally a failed movement and highlighted issues with the leadership of Ratu Cakobau and also highlighted the massive technological indifference between Kai Colo and the British. It is also adopted by SODELPA in Fiji and I will make no apology in saying that it has ruined the otherwise distinctive design.

The Flag of Yavusa Bau literally looks like the Russian flag but more Orthodox. Nothing distinctly FIjian about it at all.

Now that we've gotten all of the historical flags out of the way


[28-May-21 05:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We can look at the 2013 proposals!


[28-May-21 05:23 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Design 35 has some nice colour schemes and sets out a trend for Fijian colour schemes, with the lighter and darker blues with the stark white. However, the flag doesn't really feel like it is an actual flag for Fiji. No one, not even Taro farmers, can actually tell what the hell the Taro in the center is supposed to be without looking it up. Additionally, maybe not the best thing to have Taro on the flag when Taro disease has destroyed the crop

[28-May-21 05:23 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Design 35: 4/10**


[28-May-21 05:24 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Design 36 is showing a far more positive trend, in the category I like to call "The Middle Eastern Triangle". The design is legitimately good and looks super appealing and feels distinctly Pacific (Pasifika pride take over the triangle design on flags). However, the decision to use a *conch shell* does not at all invoke feelings of Fiji. This flag makes me think of something a hotel or resort would move.

**Design 36: 6/10**


[28-May-21 05:25 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Design 37 is literally the above but without the stars. Objectively worse

**Design 37: 3/10**


[28-May-21 05:26 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Design 38 is the same format as above but using a turtle. I will rate it the exact same because turtles are cute, but not distinctly Fijian

**Design 39: 3/10**


[28-May-21 05:28 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Now that's what I'm talking about! Design 40 is distinctly Fijian, has a nice depiction of a Drua highlighting our pride as seaman and has the colour gradients I'm looking for in an alternative flag of Fiji! However, the issue I can see with this flag is the flag waving in the wind. I don't know, but the Drua being front and center means that it would overall detract from seeing it flying. I'd think it would be advertising shipbuilders in Lautoka, not really our national flag.

[28-May-21 05:28 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Design 40: 7/10**


[28-May-21 05:30 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Design 41 objectively improves on the previous design by making the Drua slightly off center and smaller. I think this actually improves the flag design by a lot. I also forgot to highlight the fact that these flags use most of the national colours of red, white, blue with oft-neglected yellow being forgotten once again!

[15-Jun-21 08:23 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Labasa have the ball right in front of the posts!


[15-Jun-21 08:24 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Maibvatu is calling for the ball like a madman, but the forwards wont let it out


[15-Jun-21 08:24 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
PENALTY TO LABASA - Hands in the ruck by loujwert


[15-Jun-21 08:24 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Peni signals to the uprights, and Labasa seem like they will have first blood today!


[15-Jun-21 08:24 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
**PENALTY IS SUCCESSFUL** 

*3-0 to Labasa*


[15-Jun-21 08:25 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Loujwert however, hit straight back with a penalty of their own! Stefman slots a penalty from 52metres out and the scores are tied at 3-3!


[15-Jun-21 08:27 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
15 minutes in, Loujwert slot another penalty. Stefman scoring from the sideline to give Loujwert the lead, 6-3!


[15-Jun-21 08:28 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Its the 20 minute mark, and Loujwert slot yet another penalty through stefman. It sails through the uprights, and suddenly there is some daylight between the two teams


[15-Jun-21 08:29 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Labasa coast down the wings, but are unable to score. A cheap penalty from Loujwert at the 25th minute gives Peni the chance to bring labasa back, and he dutifully does so, 6-9 to Loujwert


[15-Jun-21 08:30 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
**TRYTIME**

Labasa try to knock the door down, but to no avail! A loose pass from Josevata colo is collected by Riki beker, and the youngster runs 100 metres to score. Conversion however, is unsuccessful


[15-Jun-21 08:30 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
6-14 to Loujwert


[15-Jun-21 08:32 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
And on the stroke of half time, Labasa score a penalty through Peni Maibvatu to bring back the deficit.


[15-Jun-21 08:32 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
**At HALF TIME**

Labasa 9 Loujwert 14


[15-Jun-21 08:33 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
And thats half time! A thrilling contest sees the visitors Loujwert sail out to a 9-14 lead at the half


[15-Jun-21 08:34 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
This labasa team, despite being stacked for talent has failed to crack the loujwert defensive line. Meanwhile, sloppy execution has cost Labasa, and they have it all to work for in the second half...


[15-Jun-21 08:34 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
**2nd Half Kicks off**


[15-Jun-21 08:35 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
**TRYTIME**

[15-Jun-21 08:35 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Altnik breaks several tackles, and sets up Riki Bekker, and the young winger has a double!


[15-Jun-21 08:36 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Stefman slots from infront, conversion is good


[15-Jun-21 08:36 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
9-21, Loujwert leads


[15-Jun-21 08:37 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
10 minutes after the break, both sides trade penalties, 12-24 loujwert retains the lead


[15-Jun-21 08:38 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
**TRYTIME X2**

**NOW WE GO STRAIGHT TO THE FIELD FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LABASA TEAM COACH @Gregor The Beggar **


[15-Jun-21 08:55 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Hey Tagane, was hoping to be here after a win tonight


[15-Jun-21 08:55 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Talofa Coach, from what you saw out there - what disappointed you about that performance?


[15-Jun-21 08:57 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Well quite frankly the boys weren't playing the kind of Rugby which is expected of an international Super Rugby side. This simply wasn't the kind of Rugby which any of us expected us to be playing tonight. This was quite simply and to put it frankly, village rugby. The thing is this isn't the streets of Naisori or outside of the Labasa Sugar Mill anymore, this is real professional Rugby and the boys are disappointed in themselves and disappointed to be letting their people back home down. Quite simply we need to work on that defense, stay disciplined and that is how we come out on top with skill and the grace of God.


[15-Jun-21 08:58 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Any stand out players for you today?


[15-Jun-21 09:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Well obviously we had a standout performance by our Fly-Half tonight, Peni Maibvatu, and he was the lead scorer on our end. The man is simply on the training ground and has the discipline to bring back the Fijian kicking game. He's a role-model for the team and his kicks tonight is what stopped this becoming a total rout, play like him and we'll be getting good results


[15-Jun-21 09:01 PM] definitleynotmyname#1328
Naurally, finally coach, looking forward to next week - do you think the boys will pull off a result against Port Adelaide?


[15-Jun-21 09:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Port Adelaide is the home and resident of a load of inner-city twinks so I reckon we should smash them, however it's obviously important that we treat them as a serious threat and that the boys train hard enough to ensure that this can be an easy stomp for our side. If we do that, we easily can add that to our tally. I'm expecting us to get the bonus point off this game and the boys are expecting it too.

Both teams find themselvs neck and neck - some good defence to end the half


[01-Jul-21 10:22 AM] definitleynotmyname#1328
but port adelaide will be annoyed not to be further ahead given the missed conversions


[01-Jul-21 10:23 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Solid defense from that 25 to 35 minute mark for both sides here, pretty much unbreakable by most teams in this league


[01-Jul-21 10:23 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Oh absolutely, perhaps Port Adelaide could invest in a new fly-half by this stage because their performance has been lackluster

Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm Josaia Dulakala and this is a special radio broadcast by The Country Courier analyzing the latest information presented to us in the run-up to the December 2021 Election


[30-Nov-21 07:53 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
This Election will see the "Maldives Coalition", consisting of the Greens, Country Labor Party and The Sensible Centre, seek to win re-election for the first time since the Youmaton Administration in 2018. While most expected the Government to be headed by Model-Slater during this campaign, his shock resignation and the resignation of other senior Greens members has meant that temporary Prime Minister Putrid is currently heading the Government's policy and direction.


[30-Nov-21 07:54 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Prime Minister Putrid however is unlikely to be as inspiring of a leader as Prime Minister Slater was due to their lack of real political experience in recent times, having failed to be elected at multiple junctions in the past.


[30-Nov-21 08:02 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Country Courier however wishes to offer a seat-by-seat breakdown prior to the campaign kicking off nationally


[30-Nov-21 08:30 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
(I'm back, had to take a quick break)


[30-Nov-21 08:34 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Cowper**

In Cowper, we have the incumbent Speaker of the House Flarelia from the Country Labor Party facing off against a Commonwealth Party challenger in the form of Superpacman04 and a Labor Party challenger in the form of JosephB2002. The only challenger with a history in the electorate is JosephB2002, who launched a bizarre campaign many elections ago where he declared defeat in the electorate he was the candidate in in order to state he is running for Cowper. Since then JosephB2002 hasn't really made any lasting political impression with a failed political party and failed runs in Lingiari, Nicholls and Sydney. Superpacman04 has also faced similar political turmoil having been expelled from Parliament this term for inactivity and having crossed state-lines in order to run in Cowper, having previously served as the MP for Mayo. 

The Country Courier takes into account all of these factors and the record of delivery and almost perfect voting record of Flarelia and predicts that Cowper will be a CLP Retain

Prediction: **CLP RETAIN** :clp:


[30-Nov-21 08:36 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Cunningham**

in Cunningham, former SDP turned ALP Leader Rohanite can take a sigh of relief as he goes into this race as the clear favourite against the Country Labor Party's JosephTheEmu and the CPA's EruditeFellow. JosephTheEmu, despite having political experience and having been an active house debater and campaigner, will certainly be facing an uphill battle in the electorate especially considering the likely flow of preferences from the CPA to the ALP if there is an appropriate deal cut. The seat will likely be dependent on preferences and the hyper-competitive electorate of Cunningham will likely be impacted by that.

Prediction: **TILT ALP RETAIN** :alp:


[30-Nov-21 08:44 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Robertson**

Robertson once again is squaring up to become the most competitive electorate in the country with a host of political heavyweights coming in against the incumbent MP UncookedMeatloaf. The incumbent MP, while riding off the high of the recent budget which was seen as favourable to Robertson alongside their legislative record, remains incredibly vulnerable as the ALP's Leader Dyljam crosses state borders to come to the electorate while the Liberals SurfingNooty runs as their only candidate to try and hold back political Armageddon for his Liberal Party. They're joined by wildcard unknowns in the form of model-ico and Miraiwe from the CPA and Greens respectively who will likely influence important preference flows which could dictate the electorate. While UncookedMeatloaf is incredibly vulnerable to these challengers, controversies which surround his challengers namely Dyljam means that UncookedMeatloaf can finish favourably on first preferences. However, UncookedMeatloaf's challengers could just as easily exploit the relative absence of the incumbent and make gains through that. 

Prediction: **TOSS UP**


[30-Nov-21 08:47 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Sydney**

Sydney, despite being one of the largest electorates in terms of population, is seeing a marked decline in the amount of candidates as the race narrows down to a challenge between two relative political newcomers. The Commonwealth Party's arles2464 has a history in the electorate and is the clear favourite in regards to the race but political wildcard Fun_Seat4906 could absolutely prove themselves in the electorate and enjoy support. Endorsements will be key in this electorate due to the lack of preferences dictating results and the raw campaign effort and energy will obviously play a marked factor. 

Prediction: **TILT CPA GAIN** :commonwealthyoshi:


[30-Nov-21 08:51 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Hotham**

Hotham is a surprising electorate due to the fact that incumbent Denison MP PuzzledWaste has seemingly pulled a reverse GHagrid and skipped over the pond from Tasmania to Hotham. They're in a two horse race against the Commonwealth Party challenger Frost_Walker2017 who has run in previous elections though in a different electorate. This is again an uninteresting race in terms of preferences and the same points about Sydney still stand. Due to the work of PuzzledWaste as a Minister and their relatively more known status, the Country Courier is very very slightly putting the advantage in the electorate to them. The Greens Incumbent status in the electorate, with the retirement of popular MP fvbps, supports this conclusion

Prediction: **TILT GRN HOLD** :glp:


[30-Nov-21 08:55 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Melbourne**

TheTrashMan_10, new co-leader of the Greens and seemingly the senior partner in the leadership relationship, is facing off another challenge in what is generally considered one of the safest left-wing seats in the country by former Prime Minister SprinklyDinks from TST and Commonwealth Party Leader buttsforpm. The electorate is traditionally a very strong left-wing seat and one has to admire the confidence of buttsforpm to run in the seat and try and challenge for the electorate. Melbourne has frequently been compared to Brisbane as the two "safe seats" of this country, with Melbourne traditionally being won by a left-wing candidate on huge margins and Brisbane being won by a right-wing candidate on huge margins. Considering all of these factors and recent activity from TheTrashMan_10, the Country Courier feels confident to call this seat

Prediction: **GRN RETAIN** :glp:


[30-Nov-21 08:59 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Nicholls**

With the resignation of former Greens Leader Model-Kyosanto, it seems that it is finally Model-Frod of the Country Labor Party's time to shine once again as he is presented a far more favourable political landscape. The former MP for Nicholls who famously would serve two weeks before Model-Kyosanto returned to the electorate and swept it again, Model-Frod is a clear favourite to win the seat especially considering his incredible activity in the past. He is challenged by two relative unknowns in the form of BigDickEnvy, a Sensible Centre candidate, and BryantMP from the Commonwealth Party. Model-Frod can be secure in the knowledge that not only is he presently the favourite to take the seat but he is also likely to enjoy 2nd preferences from the Sensible Centre candidate, likely guaranteeing he takes the seat

Prediction: **CLP GAIN** :clp:


[30-Nov-21 09:02 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Moncrieff**

Moncrieff has previously be a seat which was held by controversial Liberal Party Member and former Prime Minister Riley8583 up until his recent resignation and retirement from politics. Now the electorate is being challenged by Tbyrn21 from the Commonwealth Party and the CLP's artemisjasper. While I'm sure many are cheering on the little bee, Tbyrn21 is a political titan and the clear favourite to take the seat without question. It can likely be assumed Tbyrn21 will win the seat on first preferences alone and despite the efforts of artemisjasper, they are unlikely to be a strong enough challenger to win the seat from the political heavyweight. 

Prediction: **CPA GAIN** :commonwealthyoshi:


[30-Nov-21 09:05 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Pearce**

Pearce mourns as it sees the popular NGSpy, one of the longest serving MPs in history and former Prime Minister, finally step back from politics and resign from his post. He leaves a hole in the electorate which many are wondering how it is going to be filled. Those seeking to move in and take his place are the The Sensible Team's ImFeelingCorny, the relative favourite in the electorate, who is facing challenges by the CLP's DudeThatsBased and the CPA's Randy176. This electorate will likely be decided by preferences and ImFeelingCorny has a bit of a press record in recent times which will see his finish on top in the first count by all likelihood unless their challengers can mount a strong campaign. Randy176 will have a tough decision between the historically cooperative CLP or the more centrist TST in the electorate. 

Prediction: **TOSS UP**


[30-Nov-21 09:07 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Mayo**

The second co-leader of the Greens, Aussie-Parliament-RP, will be facing off against former MP and famous local man from the CLP cool-santa and the Commonwealth Party's MLastCelebration in the electorate. Aussie-Parliament-RP has previously seen off a challenge by MLastCelebration during the by-election for his seat and while coolsanta has certainly captured many hearts, it is unlikely to break the popularity of the incumbent.

Prediction: **GRN RETAIN** :glp:

**Denison**

Denison faces challenges this election from the CPA's GHagrid, a former prominent politician in the Australian Democrats and incumbent Senator for Tasmania Inadorable from the Greens, with the CLP's ItsKittay sliding in the middle. This is a fairly close run race due to the prominent and active status of both the candidates and could very well be a seat which goes down to the wire. It is entirely dependent upon endorsements as to who will conquer and this seat joins the roster as one of the great tossups of this election

Prediction: **TOSS UP**


[30-Nov-21 10:00 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Canberra**

Canberra is seemingly the only electorate this election who is facing the exact same situation it did last election. TheSensibleCentre, the incredibly shooting star independent who topped the PPM, is facing challenges from the CPA's Carter_Wilkenause and Independent Youmaton. While I have a lot of faith personally in Youmaton's abilities as a politician, it is incredibly clear that Youmaton couldn't defeat TheSensibleCentre when she was first starting her career and is unlikely to beat TheSensibleCentre at the height of her career. 

Prediction: **TST RETAIN** :sensibleyoshi:


[30-Nov-21 10:03 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Lingiari**

BestinBounds, a truly inflammatory and hard-hitting MP from Mt. Druitt, is facing another re-election bid this time facing off against former PM and former Chief Justice BloodyChrome in Lingiari. BestinBounds has seen off many challengers in recent times and has been incredibly influential in terms of securing his achievements with many considering him one of the "most successful MPs in terms of constituency policy". BloodyChrome, a newcomer to the electorate, despite his host of experience and his recent contributions to the House is in an uphill battle to take out the "Lion from the North". With endorsements from the Government parties, it is likely that BestinBounds will be able to knock down BloodyChrome in the straight fight.

Prediction: **CLP RETAIN** :clp:


[30-Nov-21 10:06 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Senate**

Now what could the Senate look like, with one Greens, one CPA, one Liberal and one Labor Senator all up for re-election? The Country Courier has done the numbers, compared polling results reflecting a national result with the candidate rosters likely encouraging national votes in the Senate and come up with the following general predictions for the Senate outcome.

1 TST
1 CLP
1 CPA
1 GRN

[30-Nov-21 10:25 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
**Brisbane**

Labor and the CPA go head-to-head here for the most part with an independent trying to squeeze their way in. This is a fairly uninteresting race but it's going to go for the CPA probably.

Prediction: **CPA RETAIN** :commonwealthyoshi:

On these results, not factoring tossups, this would have the Government re-elected on these numbers alone.


[30-Nov-21 10:29 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Government is set to win the seat of Pearce regardless and the main question therefore remains over victory in the seat of Robertson and Denison for the Government. The best case scenario would put the Government at twelve out of fifteen seats in the House of Representatives.


[30-Nov-21 10:29 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Country Courier is therefore continuing to predict that the **Government will be re-elected**

Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm Prime Minister Gregor_The_Beggar


[11-Feb-22 08:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Here in the studio tonight with 12MaxWild, Denison candidate for the Commonwealth Party of Australia


[11-Feb-22 08:06 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Hey everyone.


[11-Feb-22 08:06 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Glad to be chill talking with the PM after an intense debate


[11-Feb-22 08:06 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The general topic will be surrounding the Robertson by-election coming up, a by-election which I've got a personal stake in considering my residency in Cessnock


[11-Feb-22 08:07 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But this will otherwise be a very chill discussion about a host of issues with the two of us debating about everything going on in Parliament


[11-Feb-22 08:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

[11-Feb-22 08:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So @12MaxWild, how did you think you were in the Denison debate tonight?


[11-Feb-22 08:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Got pretty firey and involved


[11-Feb-22 08:10 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Yeah it was a pretty full on debate. Since my hiatus from politics I haven't fully gotten back into the fray but that changed tonight.


[11-Feb-22 08:10 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Fair enough and I have to admit that there was a lot of strong arguments made about the CPA tonight


[11-Feb-22 08:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The 0% voting record of the previous MP and your history in the electorates of Brisbane and Robertson to name the two most prominent points


[11-Feb-22 08:11 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Strong arguments were made *by* the CPA tonight

{Reactions}
yeahok (2) 🤣 (2) 

[11-Feb-22 08:12 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Also yeah it's pretty shit that Hagrid didn't show up to vote. I tried reaching out to him on multiple occasions but could never get through. I'll be different if I win though


[11-Feb-22 08:12 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yes but how can the voters of Denison really trust you'll be different when GHagrid was just as active prior to his complete disappearance

{Reactions}
🤔 

[11-Feb-22 08:13 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Because I always debated and showed up to vote when I was an MP. I have also been engaged in politics even outside of parliament


[11-Feb-22 08:14 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
The actions from someone who was hastily imported from the ausdems doesn't define our party nor me


[11-Feb-22 08:14 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
I'll take responsibility for his party membership, however everything he showed me indicated he would be a hard working MP.


[11-Feb-22 08:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So you'd condemn GHagrid completely and totally then?


[11-Feb-22 08:16 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Well I don't know what happened to him, but if it was the case that he had no reason to not show up, then sure.


[11-Feb-22 08:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
*takes a swill from the kava bowl*


[11-Feb-22 08:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Now let's talk about substantive policy objectives shall we


[11-Feb-22 08:17 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
As we do in chill conversations lol


[11-Feb-22 08:17 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We can talk about something else if you want


[11-Feb-22 08:17 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Super Rugby is about to start up again soon


[11-Feb-22 08:17 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
In around 7 days I believe


[11-Feb-22 08:18 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Who you think is gonna win


[11-Feb-22 08:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The whole season? Probably the usual suspects


[11-Feb-22 08:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I can't imagine that the Australian teams will get back into shape enough to challenge titans like the Blues or Crusaders


[11-Feb-22 08:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and Moana Pasifika and Fiji Drua don't have the experience, time and talent to make a similar challenge either


[11-Feb-22 08:19 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Nah the Aussie teams have got the skill they just need the leadership


[11-Feb-22 08:19 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Like this country 😎


[11-Feb-22 08:20 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'd imagine the Blues will clinch the whole thing especially with the signing of Tuivasa-Sheck who is a class act in League and won't repeat Benji Marshall's mistakes


[11-Feb-22 08:20 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The only team I think this is a fair conclusion to make might be the Reds


[11-Feb-22 08:20 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But the Force and Waratahs are awful sides


[11-Feb-22 08:20 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Simply put


[11-Feb-22 08:21 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
The waratahs will get better


[11-Feb-22 08:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I haven't seen any signings by them which suggests they'll go back to the old heights though


[11-Feb-22 08:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
They're having all the games in Queenstown this year I believe for both sides of the ditch


[11-Feb-22 08:22 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Will be quite interesting and might encourage me to actually go to Queenstown when the border opens


[11-Feb-22 08:22 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Queenstown NZ or Tassie


[11-Feb-22 08:22 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
NZ


[11-Feb-22 08:22 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
Oof


[11-Feb-22 08:22 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
That's unfortunate


[11-Feb-22 08:24 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Alright I've got to head out so this was a pretty short conversation


[11-Feb-22 08:24 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I forgor 💀 that I had to do some work tonight


[11-Feb-22 08:24 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So yes this was me and 12MaxWild being superchill for a bit


[11-Feb-22 08:24 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
