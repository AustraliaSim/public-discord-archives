First thing ‚Äî ties were randomly broken. And there were a lot of them.


[23-May-21 07:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
And also, given this is a Eurovision week, I might as well explain that any accents or foreign languages have unfortunately had to be removed.


[23-May-21 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
At the back of our chart at #10 is the winner of the song contest, M√•neskin's Zitti e buoni.

There were 3 points ties this week, but all within the top 10, so no song was shafted because of bad RNG.

At #10, we have a Eurovision song. At #3 last week, Shum has fallen, but actually gained points this week.

Renegade has crashed down to #7. Is it insensitive for me to say "get your shit together"?

The slinky summer jam from Episode One notches a tenth week on the charts, becoming only the second song to do so.

Okay I am restarting this, but with a little twist. I‚Äôll be using your actual top 10 streams for each week, ending at 7pm on Sunday. It would be appreciated to have a last.fm account and for it to be linked to the last.fm bot in this server, so I can collect data each week but if not I will need a DM of your data on the Sunday!

React with ‚úÖ if you‚Äôd be interested in participating in Sunday‚Äôs charts.
