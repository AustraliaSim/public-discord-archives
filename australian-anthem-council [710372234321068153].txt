[14-May-20 04:25 PM] JAYDEN#5487
As the acting chair, I feel it is in the best interest of the council to start working to maximise efficiency. Whilst nominations are still open, I will now open up the following items of business for debate:

```1. DEBATE: What strategies can be done to aide in the transition period by implementing programs promoting the change from the period of May 11 to June 30th?

2. DEBATE: What should become the new regal salute of Australia?

3. DEBATE: Reach and appropriate annual financial statement to Bruce Woodley for rights to the musical score.

4. DEBATE: How long should the new Anthem be?```

Debate will be cognate. Stand to speak, and I will call on you. At the beginning of your speech, please advise me what debate you will be discussing. You may formally provide a recommendation by saying `Mr Acting Chair, I move the following recommendation:` Debate will go for 48 hours, but at any time a member of the council may move that that question be put.


[14-May-20 05:09 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Mr Acting Chair, I move the following recommendation: 

We are one, but we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream and sing with one voice
"I am, you are, we are Australian"
I'm a teller of stories
I'm a singer of songs
I am Albert Namatjira
And I paint the ghostly gums
I'm Clancy on his horse
I'm Ned Kelly on the run
I'm the one who waltzed Matilda
I am Australian
I'm the hot wind from the desert
I'm the black soil of the plains
I'm the mountains and the valleys
I'm the drought and flooding rains
I am the rock, I am the sky
The rivers when they run
The spirit of this great land
I am Australian
We are one, but we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream and sing with one voice
"I am, you are, we are Australian"


[14-May-20 05:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
This is a simple solution to the anthem issue, acknowledging not only Albert Namatjira for our aboriginal roots and for the collective artistic spirit of a romanticist Australia, Clancy represents our rural and regional communities, Ned Kelly represents our rebel history and free spirit


[14-May-20 05:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and we are all the fundamental and integral part of what makes Australia, Australia


[14-May-20 05:13 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
For the regal salute, the same principle of the two starting bars of the I Am Australian could be used


[14-May-20 05:13 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Therefore


[14-May-20 05:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Mr Acting Chair, I move the following recommendations:

The first and fourth bar of I Am Australian be the new regal anthem of Australia


[14-May-20 05:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Finally, subject 3


[14-May-20 05:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
For Bruce Woodley, I'd recommend an annual amount of $500,000


[14-May-20 05:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Therefore


[14-May-20 05:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Mr Acting Chair, I move the following recommendations:

$500,000 to be paid annually to Bruce Woodley upon Bruce Woodley confirming that compensation is an acceptable amount


[14-May-20 05:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Finally, how long should the anthem be?


[14-May-20 05:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Mr Acting Chair, I move the following recommendations:

The length of the anthem should be the length I submitted


[14-May-20 05:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
This council is a waste of time and I am glad that this entire process will be done with shortly


[14-May-20 05:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

[14-May-20 05:18 PM] RunasSudo#2416
M: Gregor has just made 4 points in one go. I'm sure many will want to respond to those points, and make their own recommendations. Note further that apparently we should "Stand to speak, and [the chair] will call on you." I don't see this working at all. Also – *you* "go away". We are all duly appointed to this council.


[14-May-20 05:21 PM] Zak#6496
If the council is a waste of time, why come here and abide by its rules and it’s objectives, make a statement, and a proposal?


[14-May-20 05:38 PM] Ash#8178
M: I worry that a subreddit would be inactive


[14-May-20 05:39 PM] RunasSudo#2416
@Ash We'd only really need one Reddit thread per overarching debate topic


[14-May-20 05:39 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Mr Acting Chair, (M: as it appears we are not doing the "stand to speak and I will call on you thing") I rise to speak to matter number 4 and (M: since apparently we're not following the topics either) to the words of the anthem. I move the recommendation:

> 1. That the entirety of "I Am Australian" should be the full national anthem.
> 2. That the chorus, alone, should be endorsed as an acceptable extract.
> 3. That the use of any other extracts should be a matter for individuals, and the government should provide no further guidance on the use of extracts other than the full song or the chorus alone.

This reflects the outcome of the recent plebiscite in which the Australian public voted overwhelmingly to accept "I Am Australian" as the national anthem, on the understanding that they were voting for the song as it exists today, not some arbitrary alteration. Additionally, the song, as any song is constructed, must be viewed as a whole, and the use of any arbitrary isolated extract undermines the artistic integrity of the work and necessarily restricts its scope – which was one of the song's strongest features.

Of course, the song as a whole is quite long, and for practical reasons a shortened version is necessary. Endorsing the chorus, and only the chorus, for this purpose, avoids difficult and counterproductive disunifying questions of what and how much to cut, while still capturing the key themes of harmony, community and multiculturalism.

In the event that this is not acceptable to the Council, I do have further recommendations to make and will elaborate on these in due course.

Acting Chair,

It is well known that I am very sceptical of this council and the reasons for its existance, however I am hoping that my concerns can be met and we can move to the proper anthem as soon as possible. The May 2020 Anthem Plebiscite showed a victory for I am Australian, and it is only right that the full anthem be adopted as such. I thus move the following drafted legislation to the consideration of the council.

[14-May-20 05:51 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Mr Acting Chair I rise to a point of order. Mr Griffo is behaving in a highly unparliamentary manner and should direct his remarks through the chair.


[14-May-20 05:52 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Mr Acting Chair, on the assumption that Mr Griffo's remarks are intended to object to the seeking of leave by the member of the public, I further move:

Indeed, on the contrary, I would direct the attention of the chair to the common law principle expressed in *Bishop of Chichester v Harward* (1787) 1 Term Rep 650 that the chair does not, at common law, have the power or right to exercise a casting vote unless express power is given in the rules or relevant statute.
