@deleted-role This is currently restricted to Cabinet, Judiciary and Clerks. Anyone else you guys think I should add?


[15-Aug-17 03:50 PM] abiramen#1521
This is the Office of Parliamentary Counsel (aka Mtmdog's bill writing committee)

@MP @Senator Welcome


[15-Aug-17 03:53 PM] abiramen#1521
I mean I don't understand why MPchat and Senatorchat were insufficient


[15-Aug-17 03:53 PM] abiramen#1521
But sure


[15-Aug-17 04:15 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
It's just for ghey stuff right?


[15-Aug-17 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wanted a place where everyone could work on bills


[15-Aug-17 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
to try and get actual stuff done


[15-Aug-17 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
because there's been a conspicuous lack


[15-Aug-17 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
So, anyone have an idea for a bill to start off?


[15-Aug-17 04:42 PM] General_Rommel#0190
well I would provide counsel


[15-Aug-17 04:42 PM] General_Rommel#0190
But I expect people to have the idea


[15-Aug-17 04:42 PM] General_Rommel#0190
before asking questions


[15-Aug-17 05:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
@General_Rommel I'll be sending the bill I mentioned on reddit later tonight when I get home!

[15-Aug-17 06:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh wait 100% by 2020


[15-Aug-17 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000

[15-Aug-17 07:11 PM] General_Rommel#0190

@Deleted User Made any progress with the Beverage Gratis (Free Beer) Act 2017 ?


[15-Aug-17 08:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
ah not yet, I felt after the sausage dogs act I should give people some time to recover from the sheer brilliance of my legislative touch


[15-Aug-17 08:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
ah about the sausage dogs


[15-Aug-17 08:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Did you account for criminals and those who abuse animals?


[15-Aug-17 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
i.e. You don't want to fund a dog and it go to someone with a history of animal abuse


[15-Aug-17 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
I didn't, I've withdrawn it anyway due to resounding lack of support haha. But I was going to put together a related and more thought out bill relating to mental health, including some therapy animals, so I'll include something regarding abuse in that one for sure


[15-Aug-17 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
What's the best way of sending a bill that is on a PDF document to the chair?


[15-Aug-17 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
hmm probably upload to a drop box


[15-Aug-17 09:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
or like megaupload or something


[15-Aug-17 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
make a slideshow


[15-Aug-17 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
convert it to a video


[15-Aug-17 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000

How do you keep personal info private when using Google drive?


[16-Aug-17 10:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
ahh I created a seperate account to use for the si


[16-Aug-17 10:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
but there are probably options in privacy for it


[16-Aug-17 10:37 AM] DirtySaiyan#0464
Ahh true should probably do that anyway


[16-Aug-17 12:14 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
There is no way unless you create a new account


[16-Aug-17 12:14 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
And it's not letting me create a new account

I'll fix that when I can


[16-Aug-17 01:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@Deleted User 512350472 do it in an incognito window


[16-Aug-17 02:46 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I did


[16-Aug-17 03:32 PM] RunasSudo#2416
@Deleted User 512350472 So I hear you want to introduce a new method of criminal punishment?


[16-Aug-17 03:32 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Yes indeed I do.


[16-Aug-17 03:32 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I don't want it to be mandatory


[16-Aug-17 03:32 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
just an option for local court judges


[16-Aug-17 03:34 PM] RunasSudo#2416
What would be the scope of which crimes it can be applied to?


[16-Aug-17 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Knights and Dames ?


[16-Aug-17 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
haha get them involved


[16-Aug-17 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
*(totally not angling for a knighthood)*


[16-Aug-17 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm still out, I haven't started on them yet


[16-Aug-17 03:36 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Summary offences


[16-Aug-17 03:36 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Anything that can warrant a community service order


[16-Aug-17 03:36 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
but is not serious enough for gaol


[16-Aug-17 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you're trying to focus less on sending people to prison I'm game


[16-Aug-17 03:47 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Well it would mainly be for minor drug offences, theft, road offences etc


[16-Aug-17 03:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
less gaol time?


[16-Aug-17 03:48 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Instead of gaol time


[16-Aug-17 03:48 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
for some offenders


[16-Aug-17 03:48 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
but still harsh (not a slap on the wrist)


[16-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean it needs to be rehabilitory


[16-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
but less gaol time is good


[16-Aug-17 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
as gaols are just an expensive means of creating better criminals


[16-Aug-17 03:52 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I just don't know how to make it  punishment option


[16-Aug-17 03:52 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I know the NSW Crimes Act has penal servitude at the end of it, and has it as *not* an option


[16-Aug-17 03:53 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
otherwise maximum imprisonment is written next to each offence


[16-Aug-17 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
hmmm


[16-Aug-17 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
it is hard


[16-Aug-17 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
would probably have to be example by example


[16-Aug-17 04:09 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Well that's just stupid


[16-Aug-17 04:11 PM] General_Rommel#0190
what is your alternate solution?


[16-Aug-17 04:15 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
It's a more public form of sentencing


[16-Aug-17 04:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
....


[16-Aug-17 04:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
public how?


[16-Aug-17 04:16 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Well


[16-Aug-17 04:16 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
hear me out


[16-Aug-17 04:17 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I think that public stocks in town centres would discourage repeat offenders and keep people out of the gaol system


[16-Aug-17 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh jesus


[16-Aug-17 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
no they don't


[16-Aug-17 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
spectacular punihsment has failed


[16-Aug-17 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000

[16-Aug-17 04:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
long term incarceration has failed


[16-Aug-17 04:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
and we need to move forwards


[16-Aug-17 04:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
not go backwards!


[16-Aug-17 04:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
why not have community service punishments more commonly


[16-Aug-17 04:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
and attempt to address the causes of crime


[16-Aug-17 04:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
social inequality


[16-Aug-17 04:19 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I think it would set an example


[16-Aug-17 04:19 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
It would be completely embarrassing


[16-Aug-17 04:21 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Anyway, how would I go about drafting it?


[16-Aug-17 04:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
but that doesn't work!


[16-Aug-17 04:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
it doesn't deter


[16-Aug-17 04:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
not only that


[16-Aug-17 04:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
it's probably not allowed


[16-Aug-17 04:22 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I can't see why not?


[16-Aug-17 04:23 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Imagine you're going to the post office to pay your bills


[16-Aug-17 04:23 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
and right outside is a bloke in the stocks


[16-Aug-17 04:23 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
you would think twice the next time you go to commit a crime


[16-Aug-17 04:23 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Wouldn't you?


[16-Aug-17 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Criminal sanctions that are centred around deterrence and retribution completely neglect the main reasons that individuals commit crimes. As a result, individuals are simply going to be stuck in a lifelong cycle of recidivism and incarceration. Mind you, those types of sanctions haven't exactly worked effectively either.


[16-Aug-17 04:30 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I wouldn't commit one anyway.


[16-Aug-17 04:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Plus it's a violation of human rights


[16-Aug-17 04:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
a cruel and unusual punishment


[16-Aug-17 04:32 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
It's probably less cruel than prison


[16-Aug-17 04:32 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I think it's a fitting punishment for an offence such as, say, shoplifting.


[16-Aug-17 04:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or you know, we determine why the offender shoplifted, and address it appropriately. Rather than put them on a public display like an animal at the zoo, in a misguided effort to deter them.


[16-Aug-17 04:36 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
They won't do it again


[16-Aug-17 04:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
For instance, if they shoplifted in an effort to get money or necessities such as food and clothing, whether it be to cater for an addiction or simply survive economically. Then they will certainly be doing it again, or another type of offence, regardless of the public shaming.


[16-Aug-17 04:40 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I think if they were put in the stocks by order of a magistrate they would think twice before stealing a second time


[16-Aug-17 05:40 PM] General_Rommel#0190
look


[16-Aug-17 05:40 PM] General_Rommel#0190
this should be strictly about giving legal advice on writing bills


[16-Aug-17 05:40 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I know this is a point of contention


[16-Aug-17 05:40 PM] General_Rommel#0190
but in this channel


[16-Aug-17 05:40 PM] General_Rommel#0190
can we please keep it onto the straight and narrow

[17-Aug-17 12:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
you can try look at the crimes (sentencing provisions)

but er


[17-Aug-17 12:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
sentencing procedure*


[17-Aug-17 12:25 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Don't they introduce diversionary programmes all the time?


[17-Aug-17 12:25 PM] RunasSudo#2416
@Deleted User 512350472 I would suggest providing that any "x" sentence may, at the judge's discretion (or whatever), be substituted for "y" sentence


[17-Aug-17 12:25 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
or circle sentencing


[17-Aug-17 12:25 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
@RunasSudo So I need to do this for all offences?


[17-Aug-17 12:26 PM] RunasSudo#2416
err, how broad did you want it?


[17-Aug-17 12:26 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Apply to all minor crimes


[17-Aug-17 12:26 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
summary offences as a judicial option


[17-Aug-17 12:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so basically summary offences.

well

[17-Aug-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
pretty hard.


[17-Aug-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
the general course is to amend every state and territory act


[17-Aug-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190

well irl thats the way teo do it


[17-Aug-17 12:28 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Well the Parliament now has the powers normally reserved for states


[17-Aug-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I mean we might get away with


[17-Aug-17 12:28 PM] RunasSudo#2416
So you could just pass an ordinary bill


[17-Aug-17 12:29 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Yes! But how to write it


[17-Aug-17 12:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[17-Aug-17 12:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
its far easier to repeal

Basically two bills I want to try write tonight, an constitutional amendment bill and a electoral bill


[18-Aug-17 02:06 PM] General_Rommel#0190
And submit it on sunday or monday


[18-Aug-17 04:24 PM] abiramen#1521
@MP @Senator Expect to lose your Roles in the coming hours. Party leaders and those running as an independent will have read access here until Parliament resumes.

Election campaign begins this early?


[18-Aug-17 04:25 PM] abiramen#1521
I don't expect actual campaigning for a bit


[18-Aug-17 04:25 PM] abiramen#1521
the first half of the week will mainly be adminstrative


[18-Aug-17 04:25 PM] abiramen#1521
and advertising


[18-Aug-17 04:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so the parliament is being prorouged ?


[18-Aug-17 04:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
this early?


[18-Aug-17 04:27 PM] IG_99#2172
What happens to the current bills?


[18-Aug-17 04:27 PM] General_Rommel#0190
they all get laid aside.


[18-Aug-17 04:28 PM] abiramen#1521
Would you prefer a delay


[18-Aug-17 04:28 PM] abiramen#1521
To allow for bills to finish passing


[18-Aug-17 04:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It depends on the Prime Minister?


[18-Aug-17 04:28 PM] abiramen#1521
but no introduction of new bills?


[18-Aug-17 04:28 PM] abiramen#1521
i will ask him


[18-Aug-17 04:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
the laws on when parliament needs to dissolve is a bit paper thin


[18-Aug-17 04:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I mean,if an election is to be held on the 2nd


[18-Aug-17 04:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[18-Aug-17 04:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[18-Aug-17 04:32 PM] General_Rommel#0190
no where


[18-Aug-17 04:32 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so there is a huge question mark


[18-Aug-17 04:32 PM] General_Rommel#0190
as to how long the campaign should last for


[18-Aug-17 04:32 PM] General_Rommel#0190
up to the pm

Yep


[18-Aug-17 04:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
well assuming that the judiciary and the pm are satisfied

I can always amend it. The idea of it was always to allow the funding to be available.

No need to ban certain types of publications. But yes, if amendments are needed to prevent slander, by all means... however I'm not keen for slander cases to be thrown at me left and right from TPF, which almost definitely will happen. I think the good faith clause is sufficient.


[15-Sep-17 08:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Which is also why I included a vexatious litigation section haha, to prevent endless cases


[15-Sep-17 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think we need to expand 2.2 to include acts in bad faith


[15-Sep-17 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
at the moment, bad faith isn't a reason on its own


[15-Sep-17 09:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think acts in bad faith come under it generally wouldn't they? just as a means of counting under any other povision

Because some people feel the need to abuse their position

[21-Sep-17 03:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just putting this to everyone, but personally I think the CoC should be amended to expand the power of the HC in declaring an individual a vexatious litigant indefinitely


[21-Sep-17 03:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
What gives you this idea? Any event in particular?


[21-Sep-17 03:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
While it may diminish the overall workload of the HC, I personally think a significant proportion of cases that front the court are lodged out of spite. Equipping the court with the capability of singling out individuals as vexatious litigants indefinitely would be better overall for the Sim. Although people may want the court to declare x person as a vexatious litigant, it ultimately is the discretion of the court to use it. Whether there is some check there however, to prevent potential misuse of such a power...


[21-Sep-17 03:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
We already have powers to knock back cases, I know I've used them in the past.


[21-Sep-17 03:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Though we don't have the ability to declare someone a vexatious litigant *officially*


[21-Sep-17 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can see this causing people to believe they're being unfairly treated, as has already happened in the past with a specific member.


[21-Sep-17 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ultimately, while the intentions for this are good, it may not be needed


[21-Sep-17 03:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
If someone that is considered a 'vexatious litigant' brings something forward that is a legit case, we would hear it


[21-Sep-17 03:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Currently, as I've sort of hinted at above, we assess each case individually, and while it does take up some time, usually we all agree within 5 minutes whether or not a case has merit


[21-Sep-17 09:47 PM] RunasSudo#2416

The intention is for alcoholic beverages to be free to individuals that are eligible


[30-Sep-17 08:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
It would appear the government pays them for the beer instead of the consumer


[30-Sep-17 08:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not sure the best way for that to work


[30-Sep-17 08:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I was thinking a quarterly BAS-like submission


[30-Sep-17 08:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then the ato reimburses the business, but not too sure


[30-Sep-17 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
leaving a business without payment for 3 months might not work so well.


[30-Sep-17 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
What should happen is that all voters on the electoral roll get issued a card that they scan when they collect their allocation of beer for the week and then once a quarter the government tallies it up and pays it to the businesses.


[30-Sep-17 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
They know it is coming though


[30-Sep-17 08:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
They could just not register, think plenty would register because it is profit for no extra work


[30-Sep-17 08:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
The retailer would also pay no tax on eligible sales


[30-Sep-17 08:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
No tax on the purchase of the beer or remove the GST at the store?


[30-Sep-17 08:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Any eligible beverage sold under this programme is not liable for GST


[30-Sep-17 08:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
So basically just like GST-free items at shops now


[30-Sep-17 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
But surely only when sold to an eligible person to purchase it. GST should still apply to those that aren't eligible.


[30-Sep-17 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also that goes back to my question when the distributors buy it should they still pay the GST or will it be GST free?


[30-Sep-17 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh absolutely. Only when sold to eligible people.


[30-Sep-17 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not sure about that part. I'd imagine they wouldn't pay tax, as long as it is sold to a registered distributor.


[30-Sep-17 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I might need to create a few more classifications for businesses


[30-Sep-17 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
i.e. Manufacturers


[30-Sep-17 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah not sure, think they should pay the GST anyway really, they would be with out this. In reality they keep the prices the same and instead of paying the 10% it goes into their pocket


[30-Sep-17 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000

[01-Oct-17 12:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hey. Who said I wasn't implementing a limit to the free beverages one can aquire


[01-Oct-17 12:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
If there was no limit, people would be drunk 24/7 and the budget would be forever ruined


[01-Oct-17 04:09 PM] showstealer1829#6775
What's wrong with being drunk 24/7? :sbzyNotThatDrunk:

got it


[08-Oct-17 09:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I recommend to scrap s 4 and 5


[08-Oct-17 09:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and simply replace it with


[08-Oct-17 09:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
err


[08-Oct-17 09:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
first s 4 - get the usual spiel on howt the schedule is to have affect according to its terms


[08-Oct-17 09:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
then amendments


[08-Oct-17 09:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
amendment is


[08-Oct-17 09:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
to Australian Sports Commission Act 1989


[08-Oct-17 09:49 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Add a new definition in s 3 of that Act


[08-Oct-17 09:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190
sport is to mean both the dictionary meaning of sport and 'e-sports'


[08-Oct-17 09:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190
then define 'e-sports' based on the definition provided in s 3


[08-Oct-17 09:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I'm sure @RunasSudo can explain what I mean...maybe.

[09-Oct-17 06:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
....uhhhhhh


[09-Oct-17 06:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
you do not need to write it like a bill


[09-Oct-17 06:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
a motion simply would be


[09-Oct-17 06:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Mr Speaker, I move a motion of no confidence against this government.

(Insert speech as to why)


[09-Oct-17 06:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
You should make intention to do so via #mpchat


[09-Oct-17 06:48 PM] showstealer1829#6775
Oh okay.


[09-Oct-17 06:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Then, you will need to find a seconder for the motion


[09-Oct-17 06:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Then, debate then a vote


[09-Oct-17 06:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
if the vote passes the government is obliged to step down.


[09-Oct-17 06:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
But I do ask you to refrain from doing so


[09-Oct-17 06:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
mainly cause I want constitutional changes and code of conduct to be passed first.


[09-Oct-17 06:49 PM] showstealer1829#6775
I doubt there's a second out there anyway. I just want it on the record.


[09-Oct-17 06:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Well if you want to seek support for that mpchat is the best venue


[09-Oct-17 06:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I feel this channel is more geared towards technical advice


[09-Oct-17 06:50 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[09-Oct-17 06:51 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I made a very long comment on it

its somewhere in this channel

How about this


[09-Oct-17 06:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
if you introduce it


[09-Oct-17 06:54 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I'll make a set of technical amendments


[09-Oct-17 06:54 PM] showstealer1829#6775
Okay. How do I do that? Just PM the speaker?


[09-Oct-17 06:55 PM] General_Rommel#0190
post on mpchat that you want the bill to be put up and ping the speaker


[09-Oct-17 06:55 PM] General_Rommel#0190

*walks past this door*


[20-Oct-17 10:25 AM] djello#5901
If the constitution amendment bill passes, how can this term be extended before a referendum?


[20-Oct-17 10:25 AM] General_Rommel#0190
good point.


[20-Oct-17 10:25 AM] General_Rommel#0190
the referendum needs to be held before the first election.


[20-Oct-17 10:25 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I mean


[20-Oct-17 10:25 AM] General_Rommel#0190
before the upcoming election


[20-Oct-17 10:26 AM] General_Rommel#0190
the senate can strip that section out if thats too problematic


[20-Oct-17 10:27 AM] djello#5901
And are we adding 

"All currently elected parliamentarians, irrespective of the terms of the Constitution, shall serve till the 18th November 2017, whereby there shall be a two week campaign, with full elections taking place on the 2nd December 2017. All seats shall be vacated on the 18th November 2017.

This section ceases to have effect on the 2nd December 2017." 
To the actual constitution?


[20-Oct-17 10:27 AM] General_Rommel#0190
yes


[20-Oct-17 10:27 AM] General_Rommel#0190
that was the intention


[20-Oct-17 10:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
that was to give the current term an extra month


[20-Oct-17 10:28 AM] djello#5901
So I guess if there's another referendum in the future that section should be removed


[20-Oct-17 10:29 AM] General_Rommel#0190
well


[20-Oct-17 10:29 AM] General_Rommel#0190
it can be left there, since I say it will cease to have effect


[20-Oct-17 10:29 AM] General_Rommel#0190
but yes it would be tidier.


[20-Oct-17 10:29 AM] djello#5901
Alright


[20-Oct-17 10:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
We can suspend so to pass it


[20-Oct-17 10:29 AM] General_Rommel#0190
yes the problem is to get the election.


[20-Oct-17 10:29 AM] General_Rommel#0190
will tef run it immediately


[20-Oct-17 10:30 AM] General_Rommel#0190
he cant dilly daddle.


[20-Oct-17 10:30 AM] djello#5901
Couldn't we just hold the referendum at the same time as the election?


[20-Oct-17 10:30 AM] General_Rommel#0190
...I'll pass the bill onto the senate now.


[20-Oct-17 10:30 AM] General_Rommel#0190
no, because the election is scheduled to be soon


[20-Oct-17 10:30 AM] General_Rommel#0190
as you pointed out.


[20-Oct-17 10:30 AM] General_Rommel#0190
you cant really extend the current term if your electing for the next parliament


[20-Oct-17 10:31 AM] djello#5901
No I mean if we don't extend *this* term, we hold the referendum at the same time as the election, and so the next term will be the first with extended dates


[20-Oct-17 10:32 AM] General_Rommel#0190
well then you need to delete that section with the 'all currently elected parliamentarians'...


[20-Oct-17 10:32 AM] djello#5901
Hm


[20-Oct-17 10:32 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I'll move the Bill to the senate shortly


[20-Oct-17 10:32 AM] General_Rommel#0190
since NKG never got around to it


[20-Oct-17 10:33 AM] djello#5901
Is showestealer 2nd Deputy now?


[20-Oct-17 10:33 AM] General_Rommel#0190

[20-Oct-17 01:06 PM] General_Rommel#0190
@LividMilkTea


[20-Oct-17 01:06 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Licencing for Driving


[20-Oct-17 01:07 PM] RunasSudo#2416
> state law
nopes the fuck out of here 😛


[20-Oct-17 01:07 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
No


[20-Oct-17 01:08 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I'm writing one so that there is a federal licence


[20-Oct-17 01:08 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
just the one


[20-Oct-17 01:08 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so you mean like


[20-Oct-17 01:08 PM] General_Rommel#0190
one federal license


[20-Oct-17 01:08 PM] General_Rommel#0190
to be used across the nation?


[20-Oct-17 01:08 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Holders are to concur with Licencing conditions or state road laws, whichever is stricter


[20-Oct-17 01:08 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Hmm.


[20-Oct-17 01:08 PM] General_Rommel#0190
That will be very complex.


[20-Oct-17 01:09 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Like


[20-Oct-17 01:09 PM] RunasSudo#2416
So abolishing state licences, or introducing a new one?


[20-Oct-17 01:09 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Even more complex than the code of conduct.


[20-Oct-17 01:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
That occurs now doesn't it?


[20-Oct-17 01:09 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I think the USA made the licencing have to comply with federal regulations


[20-Oct-17 01:09 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
just not issued by the fed gov


[20-Oct-17 01:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
It really should be you are bound to the licence conditions of your licence and not of the state you are driving in.


[20-Oct-17 01:10 PM] RunasSudo#2416
@LividMilkTea So abolishing state licences, or introducing a new one?


[20-Oct-17 01:10 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Abolish state, introduce Fed


[20-Oct-17 01:10 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Do you want to just adopt one state's licencing laws as universal, or do you have a more complex plan in mind?


[20-Oct-17 01:11 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I was researching about which state's licencing laws is the strictest


[20-Oct-17 01:11 PM] LividMilkTea#7622

[20-Oct-17 01:12 PM] General_Rommel#0190
because you can just drive to another state


[20-Oct-17 01:13 PM] General_Rommel#0190
up to 6 months you can use your other state's license


[20-Oct-17 01:14 PM] LividMilkTea#7622

[20-Oct-17 01:14 PM] General_Rommel#0190
is to allow it to be used indefinitely


[20-Oct-17 01:14 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[20-Oct-17 01:15 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Hence the need to bring standard material to all states


[20-Oct-17 01:15 PM] RunasSudo#2416
not how it works tbh, but let's roll with it 😛

It took 99 years to agree to a standard rail gauge


[20-Oct-17 01:15 PM] General_Rommel#0190
then why not just have one national licencing scheme


[20-Oct-17 01:15 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[20-Oct-17 01:15 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Thats what I was doing

great, we've got a target


[20-Oct-17 01:15 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[20-Oct-17 01:16 PM] General_Rommel#0190
okay.

Right....


[20-Oct-17 01:16 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[20-Oct-17 01:16 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
So replacing all state ones with a national one


[20-Oct-17 01:16 PM] RunasSudo#2416
So circling back to the big question

are you making that universal?


[20-Oct-17 01:17 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I presume so?


[20-Oct-17 01:17 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I'm having trouble looking at the NSW and VIC ones


[20-Oct-17 01:17 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
both of them are of highest standard


[20-Oct-17 01:17 PM] RunasSudo#2416
> Vic
> highest standard
> doesn't have CBT&A


[20-Oct-17 01:17 PM] General_Rommel#0190
(the big problem is constitutionality - you first need to write bills forcing each state to give the commonwealth the right to pass bills in this ara)


[20-Oct-17 01:17 PM] RunasSudo#2416
wtf is this bullshit


[20-Oct-17 01:17 PM] General_Rommel#0190
(because s 51 prohibits this)


[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] RunasSudo#2416

[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
oh right

[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
okay


[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
the second problem is the breadth of this bill.


[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It will have to cover so much


[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
yep


[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
licencing, standardisation, appropriations


[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] RunasSudo#2416
@General_Rommel simple enough to extend the operation of a single state's laws to everyone


[20-Oct-17 01:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[20-Oct-17 01:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
lol


[20-Oct-17 01:24 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Can we use Service (state/territory abbreviation/name) for the agency


[20-Oct-17 01:24 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I think its for the best because there is Service NSW, Service SA, Service Tasmania


[20-Oct-17 01:24 PM] General_Rommel#0190
err


[20-Oct-17 01:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
agency? what agency


[20-Oct-17 01:25 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
The place where you go do your testing and stuff


[20-Oct-17 01:25 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
or is that completely separate


[20-Oct-17 01:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
oh right


[20-Oct-17 01:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
why not just


[20-Oct-17 01:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
make the states recognise indefinitely the licencing schemes of other states


[20-Oct-17 01:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
that way no need to make it national


[20-Oct-17 01:26 PM] RunasSudo#2416
tbh there are good arguments for standardisation


[20-Oct-17 01:27 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I haven't quite found the proper explanation


[20-Oct-17 01:27 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I've heard of people who fly interstate to do their licence test just because the requirements are looser


[20-Oct-17 01:27 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
True


[20-Oct-17 01:27 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I could have just went back to Hong Kong to do it -wait thats overseas lol


[20-Oct-17 01:28 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Held my Ps for a year (subject to a really stupid 70km/h limit)


[20-Oct-17 01:28 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
then I would be on my full licence


[20-Oct-17 01:28 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
so that does make sense


[20-Oct-17 01:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
eh


[20-Oct-17 01:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
hmmmm


[20-Oct-17 01:28 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
having a national standard removes the need to get your licence interstate


[20-Oct-17 01:28 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
because everyone would be subject to the same rules


[20-Oct-17 01:29 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
(lol this is the most I've done in parliament all year)


[20-Oct-17 01:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
hmm.


[20-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
okay.


[20-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
My advice


[20-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
first set out the objectives of this bill


[20-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
put it into dotpoints


[20-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
then think about how you want to achieve them


[20-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
write the options you prefer


[20-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
then I guess we can start from there.


[20-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Knowing what you want to do makes things much clearer to do

[21-Oct-17 02:27 PM] RunasSudo#2416
ahem


[21-Oct-17 02:27 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I think we should devolve power for drivers licencing laws to local governments


[21-Oct-17 03:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
So do the states keep power of when, how long, how to get it etc?


[21-Oct-17 03:28 PM] RunasSudo#2416
idk but I've changed my mind


[21-Oct-17 03:29 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I think we should devolve power for drivers licencing laws to local businesses


[21-Oct-17 04:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it should go further than that

[28-Oct-17 01:16 PM] General_Rommel#0190
ignoring that 😛


[28-Oct-17 01:16 PM] RunasSudo#2416
is this based on the IRL constitution?


[28-Oct-17 01:17 PM] RunasSudo#2416
like, would it supplant it?


[28-Oct-17 01:17 PM] General_Rommel#0190
it wont really 'supplament it'


[28-Oct-17 01:17 PM] General_Rommel#0190
more like


[28-Oct-17 01:17 PM] General_Rommel#0190
integrate


[28-Oct-17 01:18 PM] RunasSudo#2416
so would we need to refer to the IRL constitution, or is this complete?


[28-Oct-17 01:18 PM] RunasSudo#2416
looks pretty complete 😛


[28-Oct-17 01:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
this is complete.


[28-Oct-17 01:18 PM] RunasSudo#2416
ok, great 👍


[28-Oct-17 01:19 PM] General_Rommel#0190
There will be no future need to refer to the irl constitution

[28-Oct-17 01:19 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It was in the origianl constitution act


[28-Oct-17 01:20 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so I left it there


[28-Oct-17 01:20 PM] RunasSudo#2416
yeah, would be a bit worried for you if you specifically wrote that part 😛

[28-Oct-17 01:20 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I just left the holdovers


[28-Oct-17 01:21 PM] General_Rommel#0190
but yeah let me know when you have finished looking at it


[28-Oct-17 01:34 PM] RunasSudo#2416
@General_Rommel looks good, couple of quick points:

Front matter:
s 10 - does "and" make it seem like all of them must be covered for the constitution to apply? is this too narrow a scope?

Chapter I:
s 7 - this use of "State" sounds like it conflicts with the one in s 6 (page 1) and s 106

s 13 - promulgated → prorogued?

s 15 - this is a bit of a weird system (especially considering "quota" doesn't exist in the context of the Constitution) - also could be easier to leave it up to the Parliament?

s 44(i) - rip scott & larissa #neverforget - to be serious, though, interpreting this is a bit problematic in the context of AustraliaSim. If we ever recognise other model countries, are voters from other countries excluded? MPs in other countries?


[28-Oct-17 01:35 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 10 fixed


[28-Oct-17 01:36 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 7  swapped out state for australia


[28-Oct-17 01:36 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 13 fixed


[28-Oct-17 01:38 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 15 could you clarify?


[28-Oct-17 01:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and finally s 44(i)


[28-Oct-17 01:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
....hm.


[28-Oct-17 01:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Good point.


[28-Oct-17 01:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
What do others think?


[28-Oct-17 01:39 PM] RunasSudo#2416
re s 15: Well the Constitution leaves election systems up to the discretion of Parliament, so the notion of a "quota" does not exist, because it's specific to the implementation of STV chosen by the Parliament. It is conceivable that Parliament could replace the election system (e.g. sImUlAtEd ElEcTiOnS) making this nonsensical.


[28-Oct-17 01:40 PM] RunasSudo#2416
If Parliament has the power to change election systems, and the filling of a vacancy is based on the election, it should have the power to legislate for that as well


[28-Oct-17 01:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
well


[28-Oct-17 01:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I anticipate that in any case


[28-Oct-17 01:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
if there was simulated elections


[28-Oct-17 01:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
the constitution will need to be amended anyway


[28-Oct-17 01:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so it seems moot


[28-Oct-17 01:41 PM] RunasSudo#2416
yes, that's a significant change but smaller changes would also affect it


[28-Oct-17 01:42 PM] RunasSudo#2416
we switched from block voting to preferential block voting to single transferable vote IRL


[28-Oct-17 01:42 PM] RunasSudo#2416
if the IRL constitution had assumed everything would be block voting it would have created problems


[28-Oct-17 01:42 PM] RunasSudo#2416
similarly, someone might like to change the senate to MMP


[28-Oct-17 01:42 PM] RunasSudo#2416
IRL the Parliament would have the power to do that


[28-Oct-17 01:42 PM] RunasSudo#2416
but with this provision it would be complicated by the constitution's seeming reliance on STV


[28-Oct-17 01:43 PM] waltor#3519
what is this


[28-Oct-17 01:43 PM] RunasSudo#2416

[28-Oct-17 01:43 PM] waltor#3519
is it partisan?


[28-Oct-17 01:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
no its me


[28-Oct-17 01:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I write the CoC


[28-Oct-17 01:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190

the new Constitution


[28-Oct-17 01:44 PM] waltor#3519
:coc:


[28-Oct-17 01:44 PM] General_Rommel#0190
(okay you wrote the second one but still)


[28-Oct-17 01:45 PM] General_Rommel#0190
anyway no it isnt partisan


[28-Oct-17 01:45 PM] General_Rommel#0190
ifc its hard to give advice if the idea is really challenging


[28-Oct-17 01:45 PM] General_Rommel#0190
but me and runas usually can give good suggestions


[28-Oct-17 01:45 PM] RunasSudo#2416

[28-Oct-17 01:46 PM] General_Rommel#0190
but yeah on the s 44


[28-Oct-17 01:46 PM] General_Rommel#0190
perhaps you want to draft something?


[28-Oct-17 01:46 PM] RunasSudo#2416
honestly I'd just take it out, it's not doing much good - unless we do want to implement some kind of prohibition on dual office


[28-Oct-17 01:46 PM] RunasSudo#2416
very rare tho and not well supported


[28-Oct-17 01:46 PM] RunasSudo#2416
particularly by smaller sims 😛


[28-Oct-17 01:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
hmm


[28-Oct-17 01:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I guess we can just repeal that entirely


[28-Oct-17 01:47 PM] RunasSudo#2416
44(i) at least


[28-Oct-17 01:48 PM] General_Rommel#0190
okay I just struck it out

[29-Oct-17 09:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
hey guys


[29-Oct-17 09:46 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
can we legislate for non-compulsory voting? It hurts my brain that it's supposedly criminal yet we don't do anything about people who don't vote on here


[29-Oct-17 09:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
purely so it makes sense


[29-Oct-17 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
We should legislate for compulsory voting


[29-Oct-17 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
and if you were registered to vote, and don't, you can't vote in the next election


[29-Oct-17 10:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
we supposedly already do have compulsory voting


[29-Oct-17 10:01 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
that would be amending existing legislation


[29-Oct-17 10:20 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Does it exist on the sim?


[29-Oct-17 11:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It exists irl, and nthing says it doesn't exist here. So I imagine it is like every other law in that it is assumed to carry over here


[29-Oct-17 11:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
hence why it does my head in


[29-Oct-17 11:14 PM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
So if people don't vote we should start sending them fines?


[29-Oct-17 11:15 PM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
Bellman the revenue raiser over here :P


[29-Oct-17 11:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
haha


[29-Oct-17 11:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, I think we should have non-compulsory voting so we don't have to lol


[29-Oct-17 11:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Just so it all makes sense


[29-Oct-17 11:20 PM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
I'd like the option to draw a dick on my ballot paper


[29-Oct-17 11:20 PM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
Is that possible?


[29-Oct-17 11:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
only if you screenshot it and put it in #memes-and-popycastas with the caption:

I had an old woman complain to me that One Nation was in the fold of the very large upper house paper and as a result people wouldn't see it so they wouldn't vote for them. Because I, someone casually employed for a day, have influence over it obviously


[30-Oct-17 11:59 AM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
I doubt a One Nation vote is an impulsive one. If you're voting for them you'll find them

Why do they gold them? Ours are always handed to us flat


[30-Oct-17 02:49 PM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
They weren't folded that was the funny part


[30-Oct-17 02:49 PM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
It was the middle one which meant it folded there


[30-Oct-17 03:22 PM] rhaums#6869
i say if we do want to celebrate the time honored tradition of dick drawing, we do a secret santa thing with posting, so we aren't nessecarily posting our own vote

[04-Nov-17 03:09 PM] General_Rommel#0190
added new section


[04-Nov-17 03:09 PM] General_Rommel#0190
for expirry of suspended sentences


[04-Nov-17 03:09 PM] General_Rommel#0190
after three months


[04-Nov-17 03:10 PM] General_Rommel#0190
no point having it hang over you for years


[04-Nov-17 05:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
no


[04-Nov-17 05:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
suspended sentences last until the end of the period


[04-Nov-17 05:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
i.e. If you get a 12 month suspended sentence, if you re-offend within the 12 months, you're up shit creek


[04-Nov-17 06:36 PM] RunasSudo#2416
fair


[04-Nov-17 06:58 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
amen


[04-Nov-17 10:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I think I made it so that the suspended sentence cannot be four months to begin with anyway


[04-Nov-17 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Really?


[04-Nov-17 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats silly


[04-Nov-17 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
There should be no special limits


[04-Nov-17 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just the same as any sentence


[04-Nov-17 11:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
So if a person uses an alternative account and is sentenced for one year


[04-Nov-17 11:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
A suspended sentence is applied?


[04-Nov-17 11:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Basically if the offence contains a max penalty of more than 8 weeks or loss of voting rights


[04-Nov-17 11:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
A suspended sentence cannot be utilised


[04-Nov-17 11:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
The suspended sentence lasts for 12 weeks.


[04-Nov-17 11:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not sure

Basically if there is a max penalty of 12 months, you may be given a 12 month 'ban', 'mute' or 'suspended sentence' etc etc


[04-Nov-17 11:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Theres no need to overcomplicate it


[05-Nov-17 09:08 AM] General_Rommel#0190
the fact that there is a maximum penalty doesn't mean that the sentence would be 12 months anyway


[05-Nov-17 09:08 AM] General_Rommel#0190
but as a sign of the severity of the offence, a suspended sentence cannot be applied if the offence contains a max penalty of more than 8 weeks or loss of voting rights


[06-Nov-17 06:19 PM] djello#5901
I probably should have picked up on this earlier @General_Rommel , but "The appointment of a Justice of the High Court shall be for a term expiring upon his attaining the age  of seventy-five years, and a person shall not be appointed as a Justice of the High Court if he has attained that age." doesn't seem to make much sense sim-wise. Perhaps if we said they could only be a justice for a certain number of months?


[06-Nov-17 06:20 PM] General_Rommel#0190
nah


[06-Nov-17 06:20 PM] General_Rommel#0190
a justice does serve for life


[06-Nov-17 06:20 PM] General_Rommel#0190
At this stage I am against setting term limits


[06-Nov-17 06:21 PM] djello#5901
Fair enough, but shouldn't the constitution reflect the sim?


[06-Nov-17 06:21 PM] djello#5901
like


[06-Nov-17 06:21 PM] djello#5901
that part just doesn't make any sense


[06-Nov-17 06:21 PM] djello#5901
it's obsolete


[06-Nov-17 06:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
yes well


[06-Nov-17 06:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Well its fine as it


[06-Nov-17 06:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190

We should establish an Australian language office that will determine how words are pronounced, spelt, definition and if a word is accepted into the language or not.

The word and means that on top of the speaker and deputy speaker you must also send it to the 2DS.

to legally have an abortion?


[11-Nov-17 04:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@Deleted User I want to restrict people from taking other people's rights away. If an unborn baby is a person, as I believe, then an abortion is murder. Which I think should absolutely be illegal


[11-Nov-17 04:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Because it is unreasonably taking away another person's inherent right to live

[11-Nov-17 04:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
@djello rape is obviously regrettable, but is no reason to go and murder some defenceless child. However, the exceptions section does include a mental state which would risk life, i.e. if the woman is suicidal due to the baby conceived of sexual assault, then it would be lawful.

[12-Nov-17 11:31 AM] General_Rommel#0190
This channel not for outlining my thoughts on the bill


[12-Nov-17 11:31 AM] General_Rommel#0190
But for the bill to be put to the house


[12-Nov-17 11:31 AM] General_Rommel#0190

[12-Nov-17 11:31 AM] General_Rommel#0190

haven't had a chance to finish the last section but it will essentially list certain practises such as live baiting,, excessive breeding, etc. as criminal offences with gaol terms. Just tell me if the bill is making sense and is formatted correctly

Table of provisions can be deleted


[12-Nov-17 12:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Just start at Part 1 - Preliminary


[12-Nov-17 12:24 PM] General_Rommel#0190
In short title


[12-Nov-17 12:24 PM] General_Rommel#0190
no comma between Act and 2017


[12-Nov-17 12:24 PM] General_Rommel#0190
(same thing for the cover page)


[12-Nov-17 12:24 PM] General_Rommel#0190
For commencement, you don't need to have the 'and the Australiain Sport and ...'


[12-Nov-17 12:24 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Delete long title as well?


[12-Nov-17 12:24 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Because already covered later


[12-Nov-17 12:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Yeah, the long title is on the cover page


[12-Nov-17 12:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Which is the 'A bill to Establish a National Regulatory Body...'


[12-Nov-17 12:25 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
okay


[12-Nov-17 12:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
(capitalise 'Bill' there


[12-Nov-17 12:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
It actually should read 'A Bill for an Act to Establish...'


[12-Nov-17 12:26 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
yep


[12-Nov-17 12:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Parliament in 3c should be capitalised


[12-Nov-17 12:26 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
yes


[12-Nov-17 12:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
full stop at end of 3(d)


[12-Nov-17 12:26 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Yep


[12-Nov-17 12:27 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
(Also there is more definitions to come, gloss over that section)


[12-Nov-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
okay so the numbering of the sections


[12-Nov-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so basically '1 - Short Title' is already section 1 - short title


[12-Nov-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and the sections keep going on and don't restart from 1 for each new part


[12-Nov-17 12:28 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
oh ok


[12-Nov-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so when it says 'parliament to establish commission'


[12-Nov-17 12:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I think that section should be section 5


[12-Nov-17 12:28 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
so s. 1 is actually s. 5


[12-Nov-17 12:28 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
yep ok


[12-Nov-17 12:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
In what should be s 5, use 'AustraliaSim Parliament' consistently


[12-Nov-17 12:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
because you start with 'Australiasim Parliament'


[12-Nov-17 12:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Then the next one is 'Australian Parliament'


[12-Nov-17 12:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
...so


[12-Nov-17 12:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
choose one and stick to it


[12-Nov-17 12:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I advise AustraliaSim Parliament


[12-Nov-17 12:30 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Okay good thinking


[12-Nov-17 12:30 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Do I just do a mass find and replace on Australian for Australiasim?


[12-Nov-17 12:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
yeah


[12-Nov-17 12:30 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
eg "Australian sport and racing codes"


[12-Nov-17 12:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
For Section 2(b), it is suggested that you leave it to the Minister for Sports instead of parliament


[12-Nov-17 12:30 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Since thats how these appointments are usually done


[12-Nov-17 12:30 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Ok I agree


[12-Nov-17 12:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
2(a) capitalise Parliament, same for 2(b)


[12-Nov-17 12:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
2(d) use parliamentarian


[12-Nov-17 12:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
instead of member of parliament


[12-Nov-17 12:31 PM] General_Rommel#0190
You also might wish to capitalise 'commissioner'


[12-Nov-17 12:32 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
ok


[12-Nov-17 12:32 PM] General_Rommel#0190
3()a capitalise Act


[12-Nov-17 12:32 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so 'suspected breaches of this Act'


[12-Nov-17 12:32 PM] General_Rommel#0190
same for 3(c)


[12-Nov-17 12:33 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
yep


[12-Nov-17 12:33 PM] General_Rommel#0190
As for s 4


[12-Nov-17 12:33 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I I am concerned that the commission is given such significant powers


[12-Nov-17 12:33 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Generally it should be AFP that does enforcement

@General_Rommel What do you suggest to achieve the same desired effect?


[12-Nov-17 12:33 PM] General_Rommel#0190
As in you can enforce them to not do sport or whatnot


[12-Nov-17 12:33 PM] General_Rommel#0190
but to fine them


[12-Nov-17 12:34 PM] General_Rommel#0190
or imprison them


[12-Nov-17 12:34 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I think you should just amend the criminal code cth


[12-Nov-17 12:34 PM] General_Rommel#0190
new offences on it


[12-Nov-17 12:34 PM] General_Rommel#0190

okay dicky sure


[12-Nov-17 12:36 PM] General_Rommel#0190
otherwise nothing wrong with s5


[12-Nov-17 12:36 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 6 may conflict with statte laws


[12-Nov-17 12:37 PM] General_Rommel#0190
because it has broad remit


[12-Nov-17 12:37 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
But federal should overrule that?


[12-Nov-17 12:37 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and there are probs animal controls there


[12-Nov-17 12:37 PM] General_Rommel#0190
perhaps you want to restrict the federal one to certain animals


[12-Nov-17 12:37 PM] General_Rommel#0190
such as horses, greyhounds, etc.


[12-Nov-17 12:37 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and leave the cats and dogs to the state agencies

If people like the changes, brilliant, if not, its fun writing this stuff


[12-Nov-17 12:38 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Or restrict it to animals used in sport


[12-Nov-17 12:38 PM] General_Rommel#0190
yes that


[12-Nov-17 12:38 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 5, 6, 7, 8 make sure Commission is capitalised


[12-Nov-17 12:38 PM] General_Rommel#0190
err


[12-Nov-17 12:38 PM] General_Rommel#0190
') The commission shall also regulate gambling practises for Australian sport and racing


[12-Nov-17 12:38 PM] General_Rommel#0190
there probably is a body that already does this per state


[12-Nov-17 12:38 PM] General_Rommel#0190
unnecessary duplication of government resources


[12-Nov-17 12:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
oh right


[12-Nov-17 12:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
because you are replacing all government regulatory bodies

Lets assume he does approve


[12-Nov-17 09:15 PM] Deleted User#0000

How, roughly, would changing the Constitution of the Order of Australia work for example


[12-Nov-17 09:22 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I don't think there's a requirement for PM's direction


[12-Nov-17 09:23 PM] RunasSudo#2416
but I believe the PM would request the relevant letters patent to be issued


[12-Nov-17 09:25 PM] RunasSudo#2416

2 Section 25 (2)
        Repeal section 25 (2) (d)
“(d)    the cancellation of the award to the person of the Medal of the Order by Ordinance.”
        Replace section 25 (2) (d) with:
“(d)    the termination of the award or appointment to the person due to a conviction punishable in the Criminal Code or the Code of Conduct and approval by Ordinance.”

[13-Nov-17 08:25 PM] RunasSudo#2416
would probably belong better in the Cancellations Ordinance, but

s 2 capitalise Act


[19-Nov-17 05:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
definition of refugee/asylum seeker could be more specific


[19-Nov-17 05:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
2.7.2 is wrong


[19-Nov-17 05:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
it should be uhh


[19-Nov-17 05:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
secion 7(2)


[19-Nov-17 05:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Parts are just there for organisations sake


[19-Nov-17 05:24 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 6(2) you repeat 'All those' twice'


[19-Nov-17 05:24 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 7(1), references to 2.5, 2.6 should be s 5, s 6


[19-Nov-17 05:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 7(2)(a) is vague


[19-Nov-17 05:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
what is different?


[19-Nov-17 05:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 7(1), capitalise 'Act'


[19-Nov-17 05:25 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 7(3), what is 'protection'


[19-Nov-17 05:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 8 I suggest adding thst only people who are our responsibility should be subject to s 8


[19-Nov-17 05:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
so we can run offshore detention centres etc. if they are not our responsibility


[19-Nov-17 05:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
o.O like other countries?


[19-Nov-17 05:27 PM] General_Rommel#0190
s 9 is unreasonable cos it takes up to two years or something to deterine refugee status

I know, which needs to change

[19-Nov-17 05:28 PM] General_Rommel#0190
also since this goes outside the migration act

there would be far less problems mhmm


[19-Nov-17 05:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
because then it will simply end the practice, bring them here


[19-Nov-17 05:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I consider the granting of visas or whatnot to be a seperate issue


[19-Nov-17 05:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
one which is far more vexing


[19-Nov-17 05:29 PM] General_Rommel#0190
especially when the migration act comes in two volumes and is 800 pages long

[20-Nov-17 10:16 PM] General_Rommel#0190
to investigate their impact


[20-Nov-17 10:17 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and to gather evidence that can be presented if necessary before a court of law


[20-Nov-17 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes.


[20-Nov-17 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Tbf we have an unofficial version of this going kinda


[20-Nov-17 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
This just makes it official, and sets limits to what can be done


[20-Nov-17 10:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
hmm


[20-Nov-17 10:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
well the thing in s 13 is weird


[20-Nov-17 10:18 PM] General_Rommel#0190
the forcing people to give evidence thing


[20-Nov-17 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah well.


[20-Nov-17 10:19 PM] RunasSudo#2416

Its only if it is proved you knew something concrete

As I say, nobody expects the Inquisition 👀


[20-Nov-17 10:19 PM] General_Rommel#0190
giving a warning is basically making a determination


[20-Nov-17 10:19 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I don't think it should be up to the commission to do so


[20-Nov-17 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
How about we refer the person to the high court


[20-Nov-17 10:20 PM] General_Rommel#0190
yes but


[20-Nov-17 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
and allow the high court to decide whether that specific punishment is warranted


[20-Nov-17 10:20 PM] General_Rommel#0190
well a formal warning doesnt do much


[20-Nov-17 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Whats the punishment for assisting someone with working around a ban?


[20-Nov-17 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000

Its essentially the same

Your mate just hasn't been found out yet


[20-Nov-17 10:21 PM] General_Rommel#0190
How do I put this


[20-Nov-17 10:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I think the CoC should be the only Act that sets the offences and penalties


[20-Nov-17 10:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
And I would prefer the Commission to be purely invesitgative and fact finding


[20-Nov-17 10:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
So there is a clear delination to what we can say


[20-Nov-17 10:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
'law enforcement'


[20-Nov-17 10:22 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and 'judiciary'


[20-Nov-17 10:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
Fair enough


[20-Nov-17 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Perhaps we can amend the CoC at a later date


[20-Nov-17 10:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
To add an extra offence?


[20-Nov-17 10:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190

[20-Nov-17 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
We seem to like doing it anyway


[20-Nov-17 10:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190

etc.


[20-Nov-17 10:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
HAHAHAHA


[20-Nov-17 10:23 PM] General_Rommel#0190
yes the CoC is like the most amended Act

[24-Nov-17 10:42 AM] General_Rommel#0190
actually


[24-Nov-17 10:42 AM] General_Rommel#0190
now that I think about it


[24-Nov-17 10:42 AM] General_Rommel#0190
was the bill constitutional in the first place


[24-Nov-17 10:42 AM] General_Rommel#0190
the freedom of speech act


[24-Nov-17 11:07 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Yes


[24-Nov-17 11:08 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Rommel leave it alone pls


[24-Nov-17 11:08 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
FREESPEECH


[24-Nov-17 11:08 AM] General_Rommel#0190
well


[24-Nov-17 11:08 AM] General_Rommel#0190
the bill was not formatted in such a way as most amendment bills are done


[24-Nov-17 11:10 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Nor is anything here really but eh


[24-Nov-17 11:10 AM] General_Rommel#0190
The suggested 'amendment' was unlikely to be activated


[24-Nov-17 11:11 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Rommel let’s just ignore that and assume it all worked m k


[24-Nov-17 11:11 AM] General_Rommel#0190
It will be fun to do a court case


[24-Nov-17 11:11 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Also in fairness it was written by and voted on by fake people


[24-Nov-17 11:12 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Alright I’ll allow Rommel provided you do a poll of parliamentarians to see if they would vote it out anyway


[24-Nov-17 11:12 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
In which case a court case would be more fun than a Bill methinks


[24-Nov-17 11:12 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I don't follow


[24-Nov-17 11:13 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ok


[24-Nov-17 11:13 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
So you’re writing a Bill to amend the Free Speech Act no?


[24-Nov-17 11:13 AM] General_Rommel#0190
No


[24-Nov-17 11:13 AM] General_Rommel#0190
You don't amend amendment acts


[24-Nov-17 11:14 AM] General_Rommel#0190
you amend the principle legislation


[24-Nov-17 11:14 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well, the racial discrimination thing whatever lol


[24-Nov-17 11:14 AM] General_Rommel#0190
that is, the Racial Discrimination Act 1975


[24-Nov-17 11:14 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Alright well ask the parties whether they’d vote on it or not


[24-Nov-17 11:14 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
And if they would and it would go through


[24-Nov-17 11:15 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I don't really have interest in that


[24-Nov-17 11:15 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Then I say go to court and have the Free Speech Act nullified instead


[24-Nov-17 11:15 AM] General_Rommel#0190
Whether or not it is likely to pass or not is not the criteria here


[24-Nov-17 11:15 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
But it’s A to get to B


[24-Nov-17 11:15 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Ordinarily sure


[24-Nov-17 11:15 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Idk, just a suggestion


[24-Nov-17 11:15 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
You wanted the court case not I


[24-Nov-17 11:28 AM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
Did someone say court case


[24-Nov-17 11:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I'm considering it


[24-Nov-17 11:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
But there are very few cases in the area


[24-Nov-17 11:33 AM] John Galt#0449

[24-Nov-17 11:33 AM] John Galt#0449

but most are just hogeposh


[24-Nov-17 11:37 AM] General_Rommel#0190
The 'freedom of speech act' was so badly written


[24-Nov-17 11:37 AM] General_Rommel#0190
and frankly I doubt it even is operative


[24-Nov-17 11:37 AM] General_Rommel#0190
in that it had any effect on the racial discrimination act


[24-Nov-17 11:37 AM] General_Rommel#0190
though I'm considering it

There isn't any activating clause to actually amend the act


[24-Nov-17 11:39 AM] RunasSudo#2416
The intent is obvious and it is not in conflict with any laws etc

If we are legalising it, why do we care about quantities?


[27-Nov-17 05:40 AM] John Galt#0449
From a simplification perspective, wouldn't you just shove marijuana in wherever alcohol is rather than creating an entirely new category?


[27-Nov-17 07:53 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Fair comment


[27-Nov-17 07:54 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Or wherever cigarettes are perhaps


[27-Nov-17 08:00 AM] John Galt#0449
Yep, or that.


[27-Nov-17 08:01 AM] John Galt#0449
I thought alcohol because it looked as though we wanted to maintain some kind of prohibition against being stoned in public ala public drunkenness

[27-Nov-17 08:38 AM] John Galt#0449
We are generally silent on these types of things because we enjoy feeling morally superior to smokers. The irony is that it hits the poor far harder than anyone else, and the people most calling for these types of sin taxes are usually those professing to care about them.


[27-Nov-17 08:41 AM] John Galt#0449

Well yes  @John Galt they care alright, they care about having control over people which is why they bring these things in to exert more control.

To change tax levels, to introduce or remove taxes do they all need individual bills or can they all be included in the budget bill?


[27-Nov-17 01:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do any changes to the allocation of funding in departments require individual bills or are the all written in the budget bill?


[27-Nov-17 01:14 PM] John Galt#0449
I think irl they are all separate bills. Here, I doubt it really matters.


[27-Nov-17 01:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just but it in an omnibus bill


[27-Nov-17 01:29 PM] John Galt#0449
Id say so. The risk with that is that if something is contentious then the entire bill is at risk. More of an issue irl than here, I'd wager.

@RunasSudo hi


[30-Nov-17 09:50 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
anyway we can streamline parliamentary procedure for when both houses are sitting together, such as at QT?

sigh, it does need work doesn't it


[30-Nov-17 09:51 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
it seems to me if someone is to be expelled from a dual house sitting, both MPs and senators should be allowed to vote


[30-Nov-17 09:51 PM] RunasSudo#2416

you do not need to say 'Schedule 1 - The Act'

well potentially


[01-Dec-17 09:27 AM] General_Rommel#0190
with respect to 116


[01-Dec-17 09:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
It may be considered to be 'prohibiting the free exercise of any religion'


[01-Dec-17 09:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
religious dealings are to be left to religious groups to deal with


[01-Dec-17 09:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190

Its a good bill. And the parliament needed something to do

The state should not regulate religious activities in this manner

Because the BCP is enshrined in legislation


[01-Dec-17 09:33 AM] General_Rommel#0190
That's because they have parliamentary sovereignty there

To the extent of inconsistency and assuming the federal government had the power to legislate in that area @Deleted User 512350472


[01-Dec-17 11:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
You guys are over complicating this


[01-Dec-17 11:25 AM] RunasSudo#2416
confusing 😐


[01-Dec-17 11:26 AM] General_Rommel#0190
see 106A


[01-Dec-17 11:26 AM] General_Rommel#0190
states to be treated as territories till they are 'refounded'


[01-Dec-17 11:26 AM] John Galt#0449
What does 106A say?


[01-Dec-17 11:26 AM] John Galt#0449
Ah


[01-Dec-17 11:26 AM] General_Rommel#0190
government can legislate freely with respect to them


[01-Dec-17 11:26 AM] John Galt#0449
OK


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] General_Rommel#0190
therefore I would argue that the same restrictions apply to the commonwealth


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] RunasSudo#2416
confusing 😐


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] General_Rommel#0190
i.e. this bill is unconstitutional


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
If you pass a state law


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Lol


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
It’ll only apply in that state


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] John Galt#0449
My argument will be that the legislation is subject to the constitution but section 116 is not enlivened.


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] General_Rommel#0190
lol


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] John Galt#0449
For reasons I will expand upon at a later date


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] General_Rommel#0190
anyway now that it is brought up


[01-Dec-17 11:27 AM] General_Rommel#0190
hmm


[01-Dec-17 11:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
what happens when the state is refounded


[01-Dec-17 11:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
well


[01-Dec-17 11:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
First, it says 'such states shall have their laws forzen in place based on when AustraliaSim was created


[01-Dec-17 11:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
Which is I think sometime in March


[01-Dec-17 11:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
at the same time, the commonwealth can legislate and pretend they are like territories


[01-Dec-17 11:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
But it doesn't expicitly give instructions on what to do when it is refounded


[01-Dec-17 11:29 AM] RunasSudo#2416
confusing 😐


[01-Dec-17 11:29 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I would argue that any legislation applying to them will continue to apply indefinitely


[01-Dec-17 11:29 AM] RunasSudo#2416
super confusing 😐


[01-Dec-17 11:29 AM] General_Rommel#0190
unless it exceeds the boundaries of s 51


[01-Dec-17 11:29 AM] John Galt#0449
Yep


[01-Dec-17 11:29 AM] General_Rommel#0190
in which it should be declared unlawful afterwards


[01-Dec-17 11:29 AM] RunasSudo#2416
I continue to maintain that we should have just kept state laws and federal laws separate 😐


[01-Dec-17 11:30 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I couldn't counternance letting the federal parliament to sit as the state parliament


[01-Dec-17 11:30 AM] RunasSudo#2416
y tho


[01-Dec-17 11:31 AM] General_Rommel#0190
It isn't right


[01-Dec-17 11:31 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I didn't feel that was appropriate


[01-Dec-17 11:31 AM] RunasSudo#2416
It's not really right for legislation identified as federal legislation to exercise state powers, either...


[01-Dec-17 11:31 AM] General_Rommel#0190
well they are more like territories


[01-Dec-17 11:32 AM] General_Rommel#0190
so no problemo


[01-Dec-17 11:32 AM] RunasSudo#2416
Territories now have parliaments tho 😐


[01-Dec-17 11:32 AM] Captain-Feathersword#7852
Not all territories


[01-Dec-17 11:32 AM] General_Rommel#0190
they can still be overridden by federal parliament

[01-Dec-17 11:34 AM] General_Rommel#0190

[01-Dec-17 11:34 AM] General_Rommel#0190

[01-Dec-17 11:34 AM] John Galt#0449

[17-Dec-17 04:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not a personal one. I use specific real bills which suit the purpose of the bill I'm drafting. What people do is send me their bill, in whatever form they have drafted it, and I do my best to make sure it is legally correct and does what it wants them to do, and then I format it, and ensure it follows the correct forms


[17-Dec-17 04:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then I send my version back to them

[17-Dec-17 04:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
If it's meant to be a joke, it should be removed from the standing orders

It's also a requirement of an Act of Parliament

Mr Speaker,

I move an amendment on which will have changed, but they would like to the basis of certain benefits provided by the basis of marriage, to no choice regarding water fluoridation.

I will receive an Independent

I will be doubling the source, you cannot confirm that holds the raising of children.

I welcome an effect on their 70's

There is able to side the Greens to ban water fluoridation program, or modified to discuss the government begins removing the population anyway), is being the contrary, it is it doesn't turn around without any reference i've made;

Picture the voters at the power of a never ending quest for any tangible reason to myself, with any tangible reason to answer any children, to stand for.

Just because some of the institutions degraded, but marriage will be dealing with the member of traditional marriage. I'm sure they do not even consider it, it Adani? is it legal red type already has lost their grandchildren having access to even consider it, they will form the representation of hate crime. Funny how Labor have access to legal here, I'm standing legislation in my decision.

It's a valid point. The budget does take weeks to do and then to draft up all the associated bills that go along with it. Not to mention the need for agreement amongst parties and members.

But they can't, because they lost to people doing nothing


[18-Dec-17 12:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Perhaps it is more the partisan nature of what is meant to be an impartial position.

Not to mention there are people who could introduce bills but won't pass so why bother?

Also I'm not going to take this spray directed at me since I am one of the more active members of the sim.


[18-Dec-17 12:32 PM] Deleted User#0000

[18-Dec-17 12:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm sure if just parliamentarians made bills the activity would be cut in half


[18-Dec-17 12:37 PM] Deleted User#0000

[18-Dec-17 12:59 PM] John Galt#0449
I think the question is 'can we trust the justices to remain impartial *when called on to do so?*'. Personally, I have no issues in trusting them, and I think there is a larger issue if we *can't* trust them to do so.

[09-Jan-18 03:28 PM] delad#7470
the ones under schedule 9 that is


[09-Jan-18 03:29 PM] delad#7470
also an entire kilo of weed is a moderate amount?


[09-Jan-18 03:30 PM] John Galt#0449
That's not your average Friday night?


[09-Jan-18 03:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
haha


[09-Jan-18 03:31 PM] delad#7470
well I thought it'd be considered a small quantity to be honest


[09-Jan-18 03:31 PM] delad#7470
ah ok


[09-Jan-18 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
fuck me that'd cost so much anyway


[09-Jan-18 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
A kilo is not a small quantit not by a long shot haha


[09-Jan-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
an ounce is a massive amount for one person

the cost is so prohibative as to make it virtually irrelevant


[09-Jan-18 03:53 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
> MDMA


[09-Jan-18 03:53 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
nothx


[09-Jan-18 03:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
It does have medicinal benefits though


[09-Jan-18 03:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just decriminalise all illicit substances


[09-Jan-18 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it has been shown to have positive benefits with psychotic patients


[09-Jan-18 03:55 PM] John Galt#0449
In any event, this channel is about the outline of the bill only 😉


[09-Jan-18 03:56 PM] John Galt#0449
Liberty can suggest amendments once its put forward to add drugs because we are crazy bastards


[09-Jan-18 04:04 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
nothx


[09-Jan-18 04:05 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
Supporting this bill is bad enough for me 😛


[09-Jan-18 04:05 PM] John Galt#0449
Oh, are you against drugs?


[09-Jan-18 04:05 PM] John Galt#0449
Totalitarian!


[09-Jan-18 04:05 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244

This ofc is very general and I do have exceptions


[09-Jan-18 04:11 PM] John Galt#0449
Does the bill say 16 and over?


[09-Jan-18 04:26 PM] djello#5901
@Harold will there be restrictions for where these drugs can be used? ie. no smoking cannabis in public?


[09-Jan-18 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Isn't that currently prohibited and not changed in this bill?


[09-Jan-18 04:30 PM] djello#5901

Whats that supposed to mean


[09-Jan-18 05:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
The smell hangs around residue in the bong and dirty water. Something nice clean and classy is much better. But you're 15 so I can forgive you


[09-Jan-18 05:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, you don't have to use a bong to get high. Also whats a "classy" drug haha


[09-Jan-18 05:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Cocaine, clean, simple, gets the job done


[09-Jan-18 05:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's true but I cant afford that


[09-Jan-18 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000

You know what i'd really like to have in Bills, the actual text of parts that are being omitted, it's just a couple in this one, but in Pineapple's last one is was insanelyannoying to look it all u


[10-Jan-18 10:42 AM] General_Rommel#0190
Unfortuantely that isn't how Bills are generally formatted


[10-Jan-18 10:42 AM] General_Rommel#0190
Perhaps the Explanatory Memorandums can better explain what the changes do


[10-Jan-18 10:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
I know it's not, but it could be


[10-Jan-18 10:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that would ve good. When WMO does it he does mention what it  is changing. Not the actual change just what area it is changing


[10-Jan-18 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, usually bills do not say "omit section 38 which says blah blah"


[10-Jan-18 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's just not necessary


[10-Jan-18 03:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
You can get up a copy of the current act to see what is being changed


[10-Jan-18 03:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
it's a huge pain


[10-Jan-18 03:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
this would just be easy


[10-Jan-18 03:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
include it in faint quote or something

No


[10-Jan-18 04:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I agree with wmo


[10-Jan-18 04:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
If needed insert into exmemo


[10-Jan-18 04:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Great, make it required in ex memo then


[10-Jan-18 04:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
somewhere in the bill

It'll save a lot of time, improve quality of debate


[10-Jan-18 04:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
So you expect me to basically create a mirror bill in an EM with everything being omitted, because people can't be bothered to google a bill?


[10-Jan-18 04:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
No


[10-Jan-18 04:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
I won't do it


[10-Jan-18 04:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well tbf the people writing the bill should be doing that.


[10-Jan-18 04:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
And that shouldn't be you

the bill writer


[10-Jan-18 04:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
if they're amending something, presumably they know what they're removing


[10-Jan-18 04:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
or changing


[10-Jan-18 05:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
That should be in the EM anyway


[10-Jan-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
You'd be fucking surprised @Deleted User


[10-Jan-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Bill writers often have no idea what they're removing


[10-Jan-18 05:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well this should also improve the quality of bills then


[10-Jan-18 05:03 PM] Deleted User#0000

One bill and that's because I thought it wasn't needed


[11-Jan-18 09:00 AM] General_Rommel#0190
okay oaky just calm down guys what I propose is that we simply ensure the explanatory memo explains things well


[11-Jan-18 09:00 AM] General_Rommel#0190
no need to provide mock 'amended acts' that simulate the effect of the bill

Isn't that how Gorton ended up being PM in the Senate, by being DPM in the Senate?


[26-Feb-18 02:55 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I could be wrong though


[26-Feb-18 02:59 PM] Hoog#6115
Nah I think he became PM by winning the LPA election


[26-Feb-18 02:59 PM] Hoog#6115
and then he was only both a senator and a PM for less than a month before transferring to the HoR


[26-Feb-18 03:06 PM] Hoog#6115
it appears that it is possible, but against constitutional convention


[26-Feb-18 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's fine unless he becomes the full-time PM

Gorton was a Senator when he won the Liberal leadership, only to resign from the senate and take Holt’s seat of Higgins in the House.

[27-Feb-18 09:46 AM] General_Rommel#0190
s 10 only applies for people banned before the assent of the new australiasim constitution


[27-Feb-18 09:47 AM] General_Rommel#0190
(unless you reintroduced permanent bans)


[27-Feb-18 09:47 AM] General_Rommel#0190
s 13 is redundant because if a person is punished for doing something using an alt, the alt is permabanned and the original will get the penalty anyway


[27-Feb-18 09:48 AM] General_Rommel#0190
(see s 79 for more details)


[27-Feb-18 09:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
I suppose s13 wording could be better


[27-Feb-18 09:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
But basically, bans don't have to be perm until the 3rd offence for alts

They can be perm at the first offence


[27-Feb-18 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
but a mandatory permanent sentence doesn't apply until the 3rd


[27-Feb-18 09:49 AM] General_Rommel#0190
As you very well know I am against permanent sentences so I will not comment on those other than to say I will vote against bills containing such an amendment


[27-Feb-18 09:50 AM] General_Rommel#0190
introducing s 18A is troublesome


[27-Feb-18 09:50 AM] General_Rommel#0190
arguably because that is less 'sim' and too much 'real life'


[27-Feb-18 09:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Not really


[27-Feb-18 09:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
It's targeted towards sim activity, possible the wording could be better?


[27-Feb-18 09:50 AM] General_Rommel#0190
This should be dealt with, not via code of conduct act but via moderators


[27-Feb-18 09:50 AM] General_Rommel#0190
privately handling them on a case by case basis


[27-Feb-18 09:51 AM] General_Rommel#0190
s 22(2) was supposed to be for alts voting more than once in an election. I forgot to adjust the wording for that...it should read 'a member shall not use an alternative account to vote more than....


[27-Feb-18 09:51 AM] General_Rommel#0190
and the penalty was to be doubled


[27-Feb-18 09:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
So what if someone accidently votes twice


[27-Feb-18 09:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
because of a system bug


[27-Feb-18 09:53 AM] General_Rommel#0190
a person can be guilty and get no sentence


[27-Feb-18 09:53 AM] General_Rommel#0190
the judge can consider the facts


[27-Feb-18 09:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Perhaps that should be a defence?


[27-Feb-18 09:53 AM] General_Rommel#0190
Opposed to changes to s 29 on alts


[27-Feb-18 09:54 AM] General_Rommel#0190
no defence required


[27-Feb-18 09:54 AM] General_Rommel#0190
s 28 already covers


[27-Feb-18 09:54 AM] General_Rommel#0190
defences listed not exhaustive


[27-Feb-18 09:55 AM] General_Rommel#0190
tbh the use of alternatives to trial can be changed to forbid them if there is an alternative account use involved


[27-Feb-18 09:55 AM] General_Rommel#0190
so add a new subsection to s 52 instead


[27-Feb-18 09:55 AM] General_Rommel#0190
so no need to amend s 67


[27-Feb-18 09:57 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I'm happy to change s 79 but only if there are no changes to the current sentence lengths i.e. no lifetime or inordinate bans


[27-Feb-18 09:57 AM] General_Rommel#0190
and thats all my commentary

Rainfall is distributed unevenly, both
geographically and seasonally, across Australia. In
vast areas the average annual rainfall is less than
200 mm/year, while in parts of north eastern
Queensland and western Tasmania rainfall
exceeds 3,000 mm/year. Most of this rainfall, even
in the wetter catchments, does not run off into
the river systems. On average, only 12% (less than
3% in the drier areas and up to 24% in the wetter
areas) of rainfall enters the rivers; the remaining
rainfall is accounted for by evaporation, used by
vegetation or stored in lakes, wetlands and
groundwater aquifers. Almost 50% of Australia’s
average annual run-off enters the Gulf of
Carpentaria, a region of relatively limited water
resource development, and the Timor Sea

[28-Apr-20 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I literally just said the term "big picture"


[28-Apr-20 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
is that related to something else?


[28-Apr-20 09:33 PM] Hagrid#3801
Big Picture is an alternate curriculum for Grade 9 and 10, Its pretty good, focussing on work experience its a really different environment


[28-Apr-20 09:34 PM] Hagrid#3801
I did it in high school

[29-Apr-20 04:41 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Would this work as an amendment?


[29-Apr-20 04:42 PM] RMSteve#7137
What about during times of emergency?


[29-Apr-20 04:42 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
You would probably want to codify exceptions, instead of doing what the us did and forcing the courts to make them


[29-Apr-20 04:47 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I don't think your protections to speech and the press should change during a crisis. Extra powers such as the ones in the biosecurity act I think are perfectly fine, but speech and the press should remain the same. @RMSteve


[29-Apr-20 04:49 PM] mikiboss#2416

[30-Apr-20 02:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Mainly to do with the lack of a limiting clause.

[30-Apr-20 05:18 PM] NGSpy#8096
(I want to implement the amendments straight onto the bill so I don't have a catch 22 situation)


[30-Apr-20 05:26 PM] RunasSudo#2416
That's not an amendment


[30-Apr-20 05:26 PM] RunasSudo#2416
It's a standalone provision that has its own effect directly


[30-Apr-20 05:26 PM] NGSpy#8096
Okay


[30-Apr-20 05:26 PM] NGSpy#8096
How would one implement it into the documentation it's supposed to go in


[30-Apr-20 05:26 PM] RunasSudo#2416
You can just copy that into the principal bill as a new section


[30-Apr-20 05:26 PM] NGSpy#8096
Ah sweet


[30-Apr-20 05:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
like a new schedule?


[30-Apr-20 05:27 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Depends how it's laid out


[30-Apr-20 05:27 PM] RunasSudo#2416
It can go wherever it would be effective


[30-Apr-20 05:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
The principal is an omnibus which is full of schedules, and im combining a second omnibus with the first omnibus


[30-Apr-20 05:27 PM] RunasSudo#2416
In the main body of the bill, or in a schedule if there is an activating clause (legislation specified in a schedule blah blah... any other item in a schedule has effect according to its terms)


[30-Apr-20 05:28 PM] RunasSudo#2416
In that case sounds like a new schedule would work


[30-Apr-20 05:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
aight sweet


[30-Apr-20 05:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
that means all i have to do


[30-Apr-20 05:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
is amend the top one directly


[30-Apr-20 05:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
And then just keep that schedule as separate


[30-Apr-20 05:29 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Seems so

Can someone tell the difference between *Proclamation* and *Presidential Assent*?


[12-May-20 08:58 AM] NGSpy#8096
presidential assent means that the bill is signed off by the president to become law


[12-May-20 08:59 AM] NGSpy#8096
a proclamation usually happens when something cannot be changed via bill or it is more immediate i think?

[30-May-20 07:52 PM] Pav#1147
So a doubt


[30-May-20 07:52 PM] Pav#1147
What's the difference between

Moving for "That amendments be accepted"

AND

Moving for "That the new amendments be agreed to"


[30-May-20 07:53 PM] Anacornda#0630
> Moving for "That amendments be accepted"
This is for amendments that the Senate can't actually make (Tax and Money bills) so the house has to accept them
> Moving for "That the new amendments be agreed to"
That is where the other house has made the amendment, and that house now has to agree to it


[30-May-20 07:54 PM] Anacornda#0630
I think.


[30-May-20 07:54 PM] Pav#1147
So they don't work in the House @Anacornda 

So if I want to move for CiD what would be the text of the motion I want to move


[30-May-20 07:55 PM] Anacornda#0630
You don't need to move that - you can just say in your speech you intend to move an amendment

How does one make a presidential commission


[19-Jun-20 06:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Anyone know?


[19-Jun-20 11:13 PM] RunasSudo#2416
The PM instructs the President (GG) to issue Letters Patent I believe


[19-Jun-20 11:13 PM] RunasSudo#2416
See the *Royal Commissions Act 1902*


[19-Jun-20 11:13 PM] JAYDEN#5487
But how do we legislate that in parliament


[19-Jun-20 11:13 PM] RunasSudo#2416
you don't


[19-Jun-20 11:13 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Do we like move a motion orrrr


[19-Jun-20 11:13 PM] RunasSudo#2416
It's the PM's power


[19-Jun-20 11:13 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Like how did they do it for the banking commission


[19-Jun-20 11:13 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Because Malcolm didn’t wanna do it but it did

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten says he's frustrated by Sam Dastyari's lack of judgement and had no choice but to sack him ... again. Senator Dastyari was hauled before the chamber to give another explanation this afternoon. Look back over the live blog.

You can have a bill, but then it's not really a Royal/Presidential Commission, it's just a different type of Commission – https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s1062

[19-Jun-20 11:15 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Parliamentary inquiry bad


[19-Jun-20 11:16 PM] JAYDEN#5487
What was that motion that the gov lost back in that time on the banking commission


[19-Jun-20 11:16 PM] RunasSudo#2416
A motion doesn't do anything


[19-Jun-20 11:17 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yes I know it’s not binding but what was it?


[19-Jun-20 11:17 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Was it just calling for a commission?


[19-Jun-20 11:17 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I assume so


[19-Jun-20 11:18 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Aight cool thanks


[19-Jun-20 11:18 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Commission here we come toot toot


[19-Jun-20 11:21 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yeah let’s dew it


[19-Jun-20 11:21 PM] mikiboss#2416
You could I believe, if you aren't prime minister and were say on the crossbench pass a bill which would force the creation of a Royal/Presidential commission, let me see if there is a historical example


[19-Jun-20 11:22 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I mean it would be easy to draft


[19-Jun-20 11:22 PM] RunasSudo#2416
just say that - The Prime Minister must instruct the President to issue Letters Patent to blah blah


[19-Jun-20 11:22 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Like the UK bill asking for a Brexit extension


[19-Jun-20 11:24 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Letters patent?


[19-Jun-20 11:24 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Seems like I need to actually read the bill


[19-Jun-20 11:27 PM] mikiboss#2416

[25-Jun-20 10:34 PM] mikiboss#2416
When people use '?banme' to self ban, a couple channels can still be been, which kinda removes the point of the self-ban command


[25-Jun-20 10:35 PM] Cam T#6441
I do like the pets one Cauz it’s calming


[25-Jun-20 10:35 PM] Cam T#6441
