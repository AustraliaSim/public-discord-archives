Let's say that three friends, by the names of Youma, AMaNda and Evita both have a husband, two kids, no debt and the same opportunities.

They work as farmers and earn some cash per hourly rate


[23-Aug-18 07:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
25 bucks an hour


[23-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Although they were very similar, they had different plans. Youma chose to work 20 hours a week as she wanted to enjoy her life, AMaNda worked 40 hours so that she could spend more time with his family and Evita worked 60 hours a week so that her children could have a strong future.

As well as this, Youma‚Äôs hubby did not work and looked after the kids, AMaNda‚Äôs hushand worked 10 hours a week part-time as a chemist for 25,000 buckaroonies and Evita‚Äôs husband worked full time as a car dealer for 50,000 bucks!

Youma and AMaNda put their money into the public pension system, whilst Evita put money away each month and invested into stocks and bonds. Youma made $25,000 per year, AMaNda and her husband made $75,000 a year whilst Evita made $150,000 a year.

Soon it was tax time and the three friends recieved their income tax forms. Youma paid nothing, AMaNda paid $5250 and had $69,750 left over whilst Evita paid $22,500 MRD and had $127, 500 left over. One year later the tax system changed to the proposal being made and the three friends received their tax forms. Youma payed a mere $1250 and had $23,750 left over, AMaNda paid $3750 and had $71,250 left over and Evita payed $7500 and had $142,500 left over.

Note that the tax rates may be inconsistent with current rates, however that is irrelevant for this discussion


[23-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Ascari#4541
As we can see, regardless of the surpluses, some people are contributing more to the advancement of Australian interests than others


[23-Aug-18 07:49 AM] Ascari#4541
so, Youma is only paying 5% of her income, AMaNda is only paying 5%, and Evita is only paying 5%, so this isn't the case

{Reactions}
rooNap (2) 

[23-Aug-18 07:50 AM] Ascari#4541
the static figure doesn't judge your contribution, but it's the proportion that does


[23-Aug-18 07:50 AM] Ascari#4541
therefore, as we can see, this is leaving each of them with massive surpluses in regards to their income each and one size *does* fit all


[23-Aug-18 07:50 AM] Ascari#4541
in regards to the income tax, that is.


[23-Aug-18 07:51 AM] Ascari#4541
whereas, the "progressive" rates we have, where income taxes are increased in regards to the more you earn is purely a Government Cash Grab from Australian pockets


[23-Aug-18 07:51 AM] Ascari#4541
is completely unfair


[23-Aug-18 07:52 AM] Ascari#4541
as it leaves the richer ones with less money to spend on investments, etc. it disrupts the economy because you're trying to take more from each individual proportionally


[23-Aug-18 07:53 AM] Ascari#4541
This is completely unpatriotic as it's discriminating against incomes as you're charging the rich more for simply being financially successful in comparison to everybody else, whereas if everybody is proportionately equal in income tax rate, with a flat tax, we can see that they still are paying more, but they are, in proportions, paying just as much as everybody else

[23-Aug-18 07:55 AM] Ascari#4541
We, at GriffoWars, stand opposed to a progressive income tax rate, in favour of a Flat Tax. One size fits all, and it prevents the Government from stealing more money from the rich than they ought to be


[23-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Ascari#4541
The Labour and Green parties almost definitely stand opposed to the flat tax, as they're merely greedy thieves that wish to ride off the backs of the rich, as they are under the impression that Australians will stand for unjust cash grabs simply because of greater financial success.


[23-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Ascari#4541
This is because the Labour and the Green parties are about as credible as a political establishment as a circus


[23-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Ascari#4541
they're not in it for Australia, or for Australian values, but they're in it for how much money they get in their pocket each day


[23-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Ascari#4541
whereas on the other side of the political spectrum, we have the Liberal and National parties


[23-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Ascari#4541
while I am a member of the Liberal party that will not confine my opinion


[23-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Ascari#4541
The Liberal and National parties are simply too weak in their approach in regards to this


[23-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Ascari#4541
The Party Leadership of each is simply too scared to implement this practice


[23-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Ascari#4541
rather there is an agenda to lower income tax for the rich instead which does not solve the problem of disproportionate tax rates


[23-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Ascari#4541
This isn't putting Australia, Australian Businesses, and the Australian Economy first


[23-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Ascari#4541
Nor is it achieving an agenda of Freedom and Prosperity


[23-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Ascari#4541
It's quite frankly sickening because it's ingenuine; it's spineless

I'd suggest @stalintwo was doing what he had to do to keep the right of politics alive, and chances are it was with the blessing of Liberal. Because like it or not, I'd say both major parties, the LNP and ALP, are suffering a bit. Though they need to be enemies publicly, with the likes of the Conservatives and the Agrarians and Greens popping up, they need to do what they can to keep, what they perceive to be, 'extremism' out of Parliament, and make sure they still control that place.

What is tragic thing is, you know, there's not really been a lack of legislation, more a lack of procedural functioning. Plenty of bills *would have* passed the parliament had it not been for a Senate that didn't introduce them

[06-Sep-18 08:56 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
If you were to take out private health insurance, but know you have 20/20 vision, you aren't likely to take out an optical extras option on your policy.


[06-Sep-18 08:57 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But if you are using drugs, the government will take extra in the form of taxation to provide a kind of 'extra insurance' for you, just in case you need it.


[06-Sep-18 08:57 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
See, I do agree with you somewhat, but I think that addiction is not really "self imposed" as you say. It's a complicated set of factors that leads somebody starting down that road.

It makes no sense to take a moral stance against locking people up for being addicts but selectively deciding that there are drugs which it is acceptably to strip somebody of their liberty for.

I was born in a community absolutely ravaged by ice, and what was instructional for me was heading down to the local courthouse and sitting through a few trials.

I think this is a strong ploy from the Liberals.

Make themselves appear weak, they go in as a dark horse.

This is a strategy historically taken by centrists.

So combined take 6 "doos" repeat it by 3... its 6 doo‚Äôs in one sentence, 6 doo again in a sentence and 6 doos at  the last sentence or 666. "666" is a number or sign of a demon and another meaning of "Doo"? It‚Äôs a short name for "Demons" which comes from Deumos or Deumo, a main follower of Satan!

Baby, Mummy, Daddy, Grandma, Grandpa, Let's Go Hunt, Run Away, Safe At Last, It's The End = "9" times repeating. There are 18 doo doo doo‚Äôs in every one for baby up to grandpa so 18 (1+8="9") and B.A.B.Y. S.H.A.R.K also "9" letters. Put that together and we get 9.9.9 inverted Devil's number of 6.6.6....

1. I believe that being gay is a choice for a perfectly valid reason


[12-Oct-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
That reason is because, you are choosing to enact on a feeling or an urge. Say that you feel like yelling at someone, you can choose to resist or carry out, that urge

*giggles* African gangs? I knocked hundreds of doors in the campaign, and not one person said anything about African gangs. Sudanese people commit just over 1% of crimes, Afghan people 0.45%, Iranian 0.43%. Meanwhile, Australians commit 71.25% of crimes despite being less than 65% of the population.

Firstly, it‚Äôs not a waste. I‚Äôve been working with the Victorian state government, which recently passed a similar act, as well as Aboriginal activists and elders, to write up a piece of legislation to advance the treaty process in Australia.

**What on earth do we need a treaty for??!!**


[29-Dec-18 09:24 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Where..where do I start?! To address systemic inequalities, to reconcile with Aboriginal Australians and afford them the same rights that many other indigenous peoples have- for example, the MƒÅori in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Inequalities? You‚Äôve got to be joking.


[29-Dec-18 09:26 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What in the..no, I'm not joking. Years of discrimination and racism can't be papered over with a simple apology. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians still suffer from high rates of inequality in many areas of society, such as mortality, alcoholism, income, etcetera.


[29-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why do they suffer from these inequalities? Because they get free welfare payments dished out to them

What we need to do is crack down on welfare fraud within their communities by implementing a cashless welfare card, which limits them to the basics.

Griffo, Aboriginals are not lazy welfare bludgers who won't get off their arses to work. They don't have the same opportunities as others do. The fact is, that if you're born to parents of European ancestry in this country, you are vastly more likely to be successful than if you are born to parents of Aboriginal ancestry.


[29-Dec-18 09:30 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The apology did not magically solve racism and inequality. It simply papered over the cracks.

Let‚Äôs take the case of Gender Equality; if we're serious about equality, then we'll have a Minister for Men as well, and we'll see an equal number of male and female CEO's, CFO's Prime Ministers, nurses, teachers, midwives, women's health educators. 

While we're at it, why don't we start dictating to the population what they should be when they grow up? That way we can set the quotas ourselves and ensure equality is forced on the population. And if a woman chooses to take time off to have a child, or pursue other interests, why not transfer the wages or benefits from a hard-working male to her to make up for her lost earnings and benefits?

And much to the anger of many of their constituents as well, after all they voted for the Radical Party and their policies, not the SDP.

And don‚Äôt get me started on the Member for Gorton, of course she had to have issues with the merger and went of to start her own party! Who knows what the hell they stand for!

In all honesty, the lot of them should resign and face the voters to see whether or not they agree with their new decisions and policies.

But then again it‚Äôs not unexpected coming from the Member for Gorton, she‚Äôs hopped around that many times it‚Äôs a surprise she hasn‚Äôt joined the Centre Alliance with her buddy lieselta.

Hello.


[18-Jan-19 09:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, the Radicals dissolved sooner than even I expected, why was that so?


[18-Jan-19 10:00 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I don‚Äôt know, in all honesty, I always saw them as unstable, but with the death of MattMonti and the resignation of MBOM, I think the party just became untenable.


[18-Jan-19 10:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
So it was a disaster awaiting to happen the whole time?


[18-Jan-19 10:01 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I wouldn‚Äôt say that, but I had been anxious that the Radicals woud eventually break up.


[18-Jan-19 10:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
So if you were anxious, why didn‚Äôt you express your doubt publicly


[18-Jan-19 10:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Doesn‚Äôt that present yourself more untrustworthy to your electorate?


[18-Jan-19 10:03 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Then it could have been somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy- I‚Äôm just one person, and like everyone else, I make mistakes. It might have been just my paranoia, and I didn‚Äôt want to cause the dissolution of the Radicals.

So anyway, there‚Äôs been a merger and you failed to join the merger instead choosing your own path. The electorates of Former Radicals must be outraged because they did vote for Radical Party Policy and now they have no idea what they‚Äôre getting!


[18-Jan-19 10:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Wouldn‚Äôt it be more sensible to resign and present yourself back to the voters, to see if they approve of your flopping?


[18-Jan-19 10:09 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I did consider this, and I spoke with cabinet on the issue, and my constituents, but ultimately, I made the decision not to because ultimately I didn‚Äôt randomly leave a party, I chose to form a new one with largely similar policies to the ones I was elected on, and I‚Äôve also remained in government, as I had a firm mandate from my voters to remain in the left coalition. But it isn‚Äôt a done deal. I am definitely still considering resigning to bring myself forward to the electorate.

I didn‚Äôt leave a party, I chose not to participate in a merger to better represent my constituents.

I‚Äôm not going to speak on my former colleagues, that is their decision.

I chose not to participate in the merger.

Therefore you split away from the majority of Radicals


[18-Jan-19 10:15 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Even if I did leave the Radicals, I had a strong reason to do so.

Because I thought that the policy differences between the Radicals and Social Democrats were simply too large.


[18-Jan-19 10:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Right. So you elected to form a one man party that no-one knows what the hell it stands for?

They were elected to their positions based on a lie that they would represent the people of AusSim and unfortunately they haven‚Äôt stuck to what they said, so they should resign and present themselves back to the electors.

Dicky Knee however has an excuse. He has served AusSim for an extremely long career as a justice and member of Parliament which has slowly taken the toll on his personal lifestyle and family life. He has announced his retirement at the next election and I wish him the best of luck

Now today, I am extremely disgusted with the incompetent Australian government and I recognize some of their changes to be of irrelevance.


[08-May-19 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
So for starters, the Australian Anthem has been changed to Waltzing Matilda. The only thing Waltzing is the Prime Minister out of the lodge at the next election.

The Australian People in a plebiscite back in 1977 saw the Anthem, Advance Australia Fair, outpoll every other option in every single state.

How the Prime Minister thinks that they can ‚ÄòWaltz‚Äô right in and change their anthem without the consent of the Australian people is disgusting and I demand their resignation immediately for this preposterous act.

[20-Jun-19 05:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well you just like to throw me right into the deep end now don't you Griffo. Well let's make one thing perfectly clear, I support every person's right to appeal their case, no matter how despicable their actions may have been. It's an important part of our justice system. While I won't comment explictly on this matter at the moment, I will be making a speech very soon in Parliament regarding the george, and.... you as well.


[20-Jun-19 05:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I am hoping that you are going to go down the right path of defending the right to hold an opinion, instead of labelling the Liberal Party as the party of pedophilia which we aren‚Äôt.


[20-Jun-19 05:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well we'll have to see on that line. Our justice system and the idea of freedom of speech are based on a very fine line that we most balance to both perserve our civility and society, while also allowing expression of ideas that may be in some cases important but controversial. Now to you Griffo, what do you think about the removal of Pell's former honours?


[20-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Currently, I support the removal of his honors as the courts have convicted him with child sex abuse charges which I believe will be appealed successfully and stripped from his record. In the case that this does happen, I will be putting pressure on the Prime Minister and the Government to return these positions to him and if his appeal finds him guilty, then I will obviously end the debate there.


[20-Jun-19 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I am glad that we can explore this with such civility. Do we want to move on to another topic?


[20-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, let‚Äôs look at the recent by-elections. A significant feat for the Socialist Party, you have been one of the few governments in Australian history to have gained a seat from the opposition in a By-election, how do you feel to have been one of the few in history to have done so?


[20-Jun-19 05:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I feel incredibly grateful to both the people of Sydney, my Red Shirt Volunteers and of course my new party, the Socialists. However I do find it very concerning, as I am sure you do, that the Liberal party did not come 2nd, but instead the Whigs did. The Whigs are not the party I think will ever be able to represent Australia properly, and it is very concerning to see their vote total.


[20-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yes definitely, the Whigs have no idea where they stand on issues and what there name is and I am quite concerned that their support grows weekly. I believe they are polling on 4% and if this continues, we may see the Whigs hold the balance of power. Despite this, I feel that their election results in Sydney were a one-off and in recent times, the Liberal Party has been working as a united force and working hard for the people of Australia and I am confident that our voter base will return.


[20-Jun-19 05:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope so. Though I may not agree with the Liberal Party on several issues, I feel the Whigs lack in a certain political sophistication and wit to properly serve their people. Sydney may certainly be an outlier, but a Whig balance of power holds an interesting consequence for any future Socialist/Left Wing Government, noting their adamant anti-socialism.


[20-Jun-19 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt see a Socialist-Whig Government at all frankly, if you take into account how several major figures in the party harassed and intimidated the Whig leader over preferences.


[20-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Agreed. The Whigs labelling as a centrist party may lead to many moderate left leaners to drift towards them, something as a Socialist MP would greatly disturb me to see. I am interested though, how do you see the Whigs, and more specifically, their leader Plupsnup?


[20-Jun-19 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, everyone is entitled to their own views and opinions of course as well as political suffrage. However, I feel that Plupsnup‚Äôs ideas and policies are too radical and hypocritical for the average voter to stand behind. I mean a 30% GST for a party that hates taxation is pretty extreme don‚Äôt you think?


[20-Jun-19 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Very much so. Hypocritical is exactly how I would describe them. 30% GST is just a recessive measure in my opinion, something that I think this nation should strongly attempt to avoid.


[20-Jun-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I reckon we should avoid all taxation if it‚Äôs unnecessary, and I‚Äôve recently proposed a bill to remove the GST from electricity supply which has passed the Senate; how do you think that will go down in the House?


[20-Jun-19 06:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ce think that there is a strong chance we will see ammendments. Most notably I think those ammendments will be towards removing the GST exclusively for renewables, however having seen this debate go on Twitter already, I feel that ammendment may not even be put forward, and that this bill will come down to a few select members votes.


[20-Jun-19 06:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will you be voting for the bill in its current form?


[20-Jun-19 06:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will have to read it more in depth to be 100% certain on my decision, but as the member for Sydney, ultimately I have to represent my constituents and do what is best for them, and subsequently the nation.

Let me tell you something, I quite like Whig leader Plupsnup, however. I believe that there are problems with his party. For one, he flat out refused to work with us in anyway and seems to be happy gallivanting about pretending to be the leader of a secret society, which is just an electoral alliance but more pretentious.

If he was willing to work with the Socialist Party to stop the Liberals dangerous agenda of economic vandalism, then I would welcome him. However, he is happy to be a Liberal puppet instead. üòî


[20-Jun-19 06:21 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Also his Twitter account is a bit weird.


[20-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don‚Äôt blame him for not wanting to work with the Socialists after the abuse he received.


[20-Jun-19 06:21 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Ah yes that's one of the weird things I was referring to


[20-Jun-19 06:22 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
He helped found the "anti-Socialist Alliance" and seemed to expect us to kiss his toes and worship at his feet. If he can't handle a bit of banter why doesn't he move to a humourless nation like Italy?

You know, with how petty and weak the Anti-Socialist Alliance turned out to be in Sydney, I almost forgot about it

Moving on, what are your thoughts on the controversial Pell Debate which is sweeping the nation and the GST-free Electricity proposal which has passed the Senate before we wrap up the program?


[20-Jun-19 06:25 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Why not ask that as one question twice instead of two questions at once?


[20-Jun-19 06:25 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Let us begin with the GST as it will be a smaller answer

[20-Jun-19 06:27 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I think that the GST is a regressive tax and that the pockets of banks and corporations are the best place to get tax revenue instead of from the paychecks of ordinary Australians!

As for the Pell thing, I believe it is absolutely disgraceful that there are politicians who are supporting a convicted pedophile. Anybody that supports Cardinal Pell does not deserve to be in Parliament. Nor do they deserve to have any place in public life.

**Sydney Roosters V. Launceston Lions**

*‚ÄùThis game was an easy win for the Roosters as the Lions struggled badly to turn attacking chances into points with Sydney on the home stretch when they went 20-0 up shortly after half-time. The Lions struggled to get out of their end, in part due to some untimely errors, as the Roosters thrashed them for a morale-boosting win, showing a strong first impression winning 39-3 against Launceston.‚Äù*

**Homer:** *‚ÄùWell this game was a really boring one; pretty uncontested. The Tigers just thrashed the Pillagers as if they weren‚Äôt even there, taking the game without competition; winning the game 24-0.‚Äù*

**Mike:** *‚ÄùWell many seats this election were pretty boring; uncontested. The Liberals And UDP have picked up 7 seats throughout the country, as the Left didn‚Äôt bother even standing there, taking them without competition!‚Äù*

*‚ÄùYou see folks, whilst Nationals MP Riley and Senator AussieConservative wore green and gold to commemorate 184 years since the founding of Melbourne and other MPs walked in wearing purple, former Member for Fairfax, Mr. Gavin Grotegut was found naked draped in a flag of some sort‚Äù*


[31-Aug-19 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
*‚ÄùHe spent the night there without clothes on bar his flag and Police Lieutenant David Marcks has announced an investigation may occur with public indecency charges likely to be pressed. We have him in the studio now.‚Äù*

**Amy Stake:** *‚ÄùLieutenant Marcks, what‚Äôs your take on this.‚Äù*


[31-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
**Lieutenant Marcks:** *‚ÄùWell as a Melbourne resident, I was visiting some Victorian Members of Parliament to receive commendation for my time in the forces and to see a former MP run around buck naked is absolutely horrendous. It‚Äôs one thing to celebrate 184 years of Melbourne, but it is another to go streaking for it.‚Äù*

**Amy Stake:** *‚ÄùWas he celebrating for your commendation, eyewitness accounts reckon he said ‚ÄúI LOVE MARCKS‚Äù at the scene, what do you think of this?‚Äù*


[31-Aug-19 03:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
**Lieutenant Marcks:** *‚ÄùI sure hope not and I would like to let him know that I have a wife and two kids. It‚Äôs likely for him to be prosecuted for public indecency charges amongst overs and I‚Äôd like to thank Senator Griffo amongst others for acknowledging my service in the police force‚Äù*

**Amy Stake:** *‚ÄùThank you Lieutenant and congratulations once again. We will be contacting the former MP for comment and the Boomerang will be issuing a full report soon.‚Äù*
