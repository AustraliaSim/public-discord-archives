[09-Aug-19 07:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
My thoughts: I'd prefer to keep 7(1) as is; however, if it is changed one should also amend 7(3) such that the clerks don't need to keep a debate log as it would be redundant by that point. 

I'd like to note that section 8 as it reads sends the issue to the moderators, but then section 9 says judiciary must deal with it... makes little sense. (although thats not part of Manly's changes)

I do not agree with section 10 whatsoever.


[09-Aug-19 07:10 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
as in I disagree with manlys changes to 10


[09-Aug-19 08:41 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
I offered that when I wrote these amendments but apparently people just went awol midterm, so you could do 100% activity for 1.5 months and then completely stop and not get referred, but if that is only applied to the debate requirements and kept the number low like not exceeding 50% or even 40% I could see it working


[10-Aug-19 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok @deleted-role we need to sort out amendments to Manly's proposal.

Amendment 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaSimMeta/comments/cmaroz/debate_on_proposal_parliamentary_participation/ew0z3ud/
Amendment 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaSimMeta/comments/cmaroz/debate_on_proposal_parliamentary_participation/ew6njab/

Please indicate which amendments you approve of

[10-Aug-19 03:28 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
Amendment 1:

Subsection e's only purpose was to be used in conjunction with both debating and voting requirements. This becomes clear when you remove "or debated" from the subsection and compare the amended subsection with subsection c.

e) has voted on less than 25% or more of a consecutive grouping of 12 items or more of official voting business;
c) has voted on less than 33.33% of a consecutive grouping of 12 items or more of official voting business

the amended subsection e makes subsection c redundant. Unless you want to lower the voting threshold I advise against this amendment.

Amendment 2:

This amendment does not remove debating requirements, which is the goal here. I would only advise enacting this amendment if you wish to make debating requirements slightly looser, however I believe most people who have been removed from parliament would still ultimately be removed under this amendment as well, albeit a slightly longer process.

The AustraliaSim Meta Rules and Procedures


[21-Aug-19 03:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
A summary:
- it codifies the running of the Parliament
- moves HoR debates to the main sub and makes them public
- changes party requirements to just 3 members, removes the parliamentarian rule
- adds a proper order paper and 3 day business cycles
- adds question limits to questions with notice
- mandates a Speech from the Throne
- regulates press, stops woof from pretending to be NAB or Westpac etc
- regulates the ABC
- mandates negative mods for PMs who don't respect the HCA's justice requirement
- repeals the MSOs

I would highly appreciate the thoughts of all on this


[21-Aug-19 03:30 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I seriously oppose B5


[21-Aug-19 03:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I feel D6 could be abused, I'd prefer it to be reasonably chronological


[21-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
the main reason behind Part 2(B)(5) is to stop situations like Manly, where he effectively robbed the Libs of government by defecting on results night


[21-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't think it is fair that a party's effort can be ruined in that way, and it has the potential to drive people away

Part 2 seems fine, I have no problem with that


[21-Aug-19 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
I view B7 as a tad unnecessary, to be honest, but I'm not opposed to it


[21-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
In regards to B5, I believe seats in that case should go to a by-election and not filled


[21-Aug-19 03:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
But that's just my view


[21-Aug-19 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
There is one more problem in my view, however, that B5 could be circumvented by simply going to sit as an independent for a bit, so I believe it should be 'then leaves that political party to-
i. join another political party
ii. sit as an independent'


[21-Aug-19 03:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I kind of disagree that there should be restrictions, at least in Questions Without Notice


[21-Aug-19 03:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Perhaps in regards to Subpart F, the coalition should be released


[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
> Perhaps in regards to Subpart F, the coalition should be released
what do you mean?


[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
The President/GG should publicly say who is in the government, similar to MHOC


[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
they'd do that anyway but i can state that they have to


[21-Aug-19 03:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
there aren't restrictions in Questions without notice

[21-Aug-19 04:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
> In regards to B5, I believe seats in that case should go to a by-election and not filled
@Deleted User does not that defeat the purpose of the provision though


[21-Aug-19 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
the purpose of it is to ensure that parties who win a certain number of seats at an election can hold onto those seats for a couple weeks, and aren't robbed of opportunities they would have had if it werent for snakes


[21-Aug-19 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Part of me also feels like this would just result in defections happening 15 days after an election


[21-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000

[21-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000

That only applies if Labor are working with the UDP, which may or may not be happening

i agree 72 hours is a bit long tbh


[21-Aug-19 04:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
re: debates

Debating and voting are the roles of an MP/Senator. if you open debates in the House/Senate, then you lose the purpose of an MP/Senator


[21-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
basically, opening it up blurs the line between elected official, and randomer / salty loser


[21-Aug-19 04:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
furthermore, if we get idiots make debate on our threads who aren't elected it reflects poorly on us (ie legoyoda/toenail)


[21-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
people like legoyoda and toenail just get their comments removed anyway, and end up banned


[21-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
i disagree that it blurs the lines, i certaintly dont have that feeling elsewhere and i dont think many other people do but of course i cant read minds


[21-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but even if those are removed, unless they are removed instantly people still see it


[21-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
we're pretty responsive


[21-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
it relies on having a decent mod team for that


[21-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
like how if we ban TGS, his effects are still known to people


[21-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
the handling of TGS was below standard


[21-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
we learn and move on


[21-Aug-19 04:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
my point is that people still know of said comments and still associate them to us


[21-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
someone of his character could do more damage than fucking around in debates


[21-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
the shitposting of CSID on the subreddit is probably more damaging


[21-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
like we can sort of control who is an MP via the elections (in that people who are shitposting wont be elected unless they are putting in that much effort it is no longer a shitpost) but randomers coming in lowers the quality of debate


[21-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and we at Aussim have a habit of attracting some dodgy characters


[21-Aug-19 04:32 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
letting them in straight up can ruin canon as well as what is left of our rep


[21-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
also regarding the b5, why is it not repeated in C?


[21-Aug-19 04:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
although i dislike it, surely it should apply to both houses?


[21-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
i dislike the rule because it seems like an overstep of moderation on canon


[21-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
ie: we the mods state that you must remain in your party for three weeks


[21-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
by all means, punish them with a giant negative mod


[21-Aug-19 04:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but not adding needless rules which someone will fall afoul to accidentally


[21-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
like the debate requirements


[21-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, if you can't debate, you can still make press posts

[21-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Press is good but a good portion of election mods are made up from term work which is mostly debating


[21-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
People like gredsen in July didn't have the opportunity to build up the same term mods that MBOM had


[21-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but term work should be implied to mean MP/senators, those who are elected for the term


[21-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
i mean term work as in all canon activity during the term


[21-Aug-19 04:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I kind of agree that this is also a good opportunity for prospective MPs


[21-Aug-19 04:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
either boost media mods for non MPs or just leave it as an incumbency boost?

my issue with hiking press posts is that tbh the majority of press that we're seeing is low effort and doesnt attract good mods anyway


[21-Aug-19 04:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
people will get burnt out writing heaps of press, and with a slow sim for news anyway, it can be difficult


[21-Aug-19 06:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well people's on bills can constitute news and furthermore if it is hiked up for non mps then it could be feasible for people to do a term of news and then transfer to politics

[23-Aug-19 09:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
my thinking is that if someone chose the house, then the seat wouldn't have been filled in the first place

> i. If a candidate is declared elected to both houses, they must inform the Electoral Commission of which House they shall sit in within 72 hours of the return of writs. In the event it is not a Senate seat, and the candidate is a member of a political party, the seat shall go to a casual vacancy.

> ii. If the candidate does not, both of their seats shall be declared vacant, the house seat to be filled by a by-election, and the Senate seat to be filled by either a casual vacancy if the candidate is a member of a political party or a countback otherwise

[11-Oct-19 11:42 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I agree with punishing party hoppers immediately after an election, but could we add a clause in the case that a member feels some compelling reason that they absolutely need to leave, and they can prove it, and it is agreed that it is sufficient, that they don't lose their seat?


[11-Oct-19 11:49 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
party wobblers


[11-Oct-19 11:52 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I would say the electoral commision or the high court, they tend to handle seat judgements, and no judging is ever truly objective but i would say the provided evidence would need to meet a standard of say, extreme harassment, or behaviour along those lines


[11-Oct-19 11:52 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Someone shouldn't be forced to stay in a enviroment that toxic just to keep a seat and participate in the sim

[23-Oct-19 11:39 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
As to the administering the code of conduct, when it says enter a plea within a reasonable amount of time, could we aim for a set number that we all agree as reasonable? Simply saying "a reasonable amount of time" simply seems like an incredibly subjective standard


[23-Oct-19 11:44 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I understand that.
Maybe set a minimum amount of time that must be given? I just feel that leaving such a statement with absolutely no qualifiers is too subjective


[23-Oct-19 11:46 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
A mandatory minimum essentially


[23-Oct-19 11:47 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Perhaps a different minimum for each taking into account the different time requirements


[23-Oct-19 11:48 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Maybe allow the party to voluntarily waive the minimum if they wish to plead sooner?


[23-Oct-19 11:51 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I understand the idea with that, but to me there is just something iffy about letting whoever happens to be in power at the moment decide that time frame with no qualifiers or restrictions


[23-Oct-19 11:52 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I do too


[23-Oct-19 11:52 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
That's why I'm arguing this point


[23-Oct-19 11:54 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
It's not taking away the freedom to make decisions. It's simply saying that whoever may be in charge can not arbitrarily determine what times or reasonable or not


[23-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I do tend to lean towards a strict interpretation and strict rules as opposed to loose and discretion. I think a system isn't properly designed if it doesn't have safeguards in the case of abuse


[23-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
That being said I'm open to input as to why we should have no safeguards of the kind


[23-Oct-19 11:58 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
How? If they're appealing they're already banned, what platform are they to use


[23-Oct-19 12:00 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I don't think an appropriate argument against a rule is saying what if people don't follow it


[23-Oct-19 12:01 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I think the minimums would however, at the least make the case for a vonc clearer


[23-Oct-19 12:02 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Voluntary waiver


[23-Oct-19 12:03 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
If the accused wishes to waive their rights i have no issue there


[23-Oct-19 12:03 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
If the mods want it done quickly?


[23-Oct-19 12:06 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I have an answer for this, but it'll have to come later, i need to go


[23-Oct-19 12:07 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
You too


[23-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
one assumes its wide enough for mod descretion


[23-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I can think of one, *maybe* two compelling reasons


[23-Oct-19 01:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
one, the user permitted it, and two, it is believed to help their safety


[23-Oct-19 01:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

just one thing that stands out to me is the electoral mod being allowed to move from fully simmed by their own judgement

Does this not sort of take away the point of electing officeholders if they end up serving at the pleasure of the mod team anyway?

[21-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
An officeholder should serve at the pleasure of the community, not the moderators


[21-Apr-20 06:52 PM] inactive#6974
^


[21-Apr-20 06:53 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
And this seems kind of like giving the mod team the power to vonc


[21-Apr-20 06:53 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Which is not where that power belongs


[21-Apr-20 06:53 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I don't have any major issues with the rest


[21-Apr-20 06:54 PM] Youmaton#1190
I must disagree with that clause


[21-Apr-20 06:55 PM] Youmaton#1190
it should instead have

(d) the officeholder is removed via a vote of no confidence, or a failed vote of confidence.


[21-Apr-20 06:57 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I think this covers that

[21-Apr-20 06:57 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
We could probably just do away with (d) entirely


[21-Apr-20 06:58 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
As it attempts to seemingly create a new kind of vonc, solely for the moderators


[21-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Which is not how it should be


[21-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Youmaton#1190
id make motion of section 6 as replacement, however i dont mind as long as (d) as it stands atm is removed


[21-Apr-20 07:02 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Hot take: I don't think 5(2)(d) is that bad, but I don't know that it's necessary either


[21-Apr-20 07:11 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Why does the mod team need the ability to remove an officeholder  at their own discretion as long as they all agree, seperate of the normal process of voncing?


[21-Apr-20 07:12 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
The answer is, they don't


[21-Apr-20 07:13 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
The whole point behind a vonc is to remove an officeholder because they no longer hold community confidence


[21-Apr-20 07:13 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Not because they no longer hold moderator confidence


[21-Apr-20 07:14 PM] dead#0701
The moderators shouldn't have the ability to remove an office holder and it allows for the possibility where conflict is resolved not by the moderators pulling their heads in but by the mods voncing that person


[21-Apr-20 08:37 PM] NGSpy#8096
I agree. The moderators shouldn't have to remove someone from a position alone. The rest of the community should have a proper say as well.


[21-Apr-20 09:08 PM] RunasSudo#2416
@NotGriffonomics I don't think you could do that though 👀 As the Discord Mod would be part of the moderators, and so the moderators could not *unanimously* vote to remove one of their number


[21-Apr-20 09:08 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Unless it were just a resignation with more steps (futurama.jpg)


[21-Apr-20 09:17 PM] Youmaton#1190
Im not saying you will abuse it


[21-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
but it is inevitable someone will abuse it


[21-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
not what i said


[21-Apr-20 09:18 PM] Youmaton#1190
but okay


[21-Apr-20 09:20 PM] NGSpy#8096
I feel as if a system where all the mods agreed on a member not being valid for their position (like BHjr as a discord moderator) then it should be completely valid because the moderators were voted in and are under confidence from the community.


[21-Apr-20 09:21 PM] NGSpy#8096
It would be good to supply a reason along with the potential removal of the person as well.


[21-Apr-20 09:24 PM] NGSpy#8096
Fair point.


[21-Apr-20 09:27 PM] dead#0701
removing discord mods is fair enough


[21-Apr-20 09:27 PM] dead#0701
perhaps replace this all with the inactivity clause again?


[21-Apr-20 09:27 PM] dead#0701
but a more robust one


[21-Apr-20 09:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
Yeah that might be an idea.


[21-Apr-20 09:36 PM] NGSpy#8096

If there is community, for lack of a better word, difference, mods should revoke their decision.


[22-Apr-20 05:16 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
> Rather,  I think leaving it up to the mods to consult with advisors and use discretion is appropriate, with the oversight you can VONC a mod who makes a bad decision or you can pressure mods to revoke a decision.
But the community can also vonc an inactive officeholder


[22-Apr-20 05:17 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I just don't really see the need to grant the mods a, in my view, unnecessary power that already exists as a community function


[22-Apr-20 05:21 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
> But so they?
I'm assuming that's meant to say "But do they?" and I have to say I find "We haven't abused our discretion *yet* even though we totally could" to be a weak argument in favor of an additional power


[22-Apr-20 05:22 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
> We could ban the entire sim
Not the same thing at all


[22-Apr-20 05:22 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
> But you don't trust us
Not with random powers you don't need, and you will not be the last mod team, unless you have something planned we don't know about. This is not all about you, we have to consider future mod teams as well


[22-Apr-20 05:25 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
> It has never been at the pleasure of the community
The fact that an officeholder serves pretty much until the community decides they don't sort of puts them at the pleasure of the community


[22-Apr-20 05:26 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
> But yes,  that is the point of the provision. And the rebuke of going against the community is what is the point of Mods if they can't determine who their team is?
If it was the mods job to determine their team, I feel the positions wouldn't be elected like they are. The fact they are elected sort of implies the idea that the community is meant to choose the team, not the moderators


[22-Apr-20 05:27 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
> Well then why can't we have it?
Faulty argument. We have to consider everyone who may have the power, not just you


[22-Apr-20 05:40 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Or, to say it more accurately


[22-Apr-20 05:40 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
We have to consider whether any modteam should have the power


[22-Apr-20 05:40 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Not just yours


[22-Apr-20 12:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
i think the issue this shows is that voncs are too slow and unreliable to be used all the time


[22-Apr-20 12:12 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and this power gives the ability to do things a bit faster


[22-Apr-20 12:15 PM] RunasSudo#2416
So the big question that I have is, given mods have the power to overrule improper actions, is it necessary to do this "faster"?


[22-Apr-20 12:16 PM] inactive#6974
I think the community should have some power in putting a member back if they want it.


[22-Apr-20 05:31 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Given the fact that mods can overrule improper decisions as Runas said, and a vonc already exists if the community feels they need to be removed, I just don't see the cause for this power


[24-Apr-20 05:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Shouldn't be given them a frew pass. Now if you wamt to say that she wasn't aware of the ban for speaking to dkr and should be reduced that's a different story but it should equally apply to a 50yo doing it as and not be treated different because they are older

BC you didn't seriously just attempt to use "but look at this one example" as a counterargument to a point based on *chance* did you?

I think thats better but idk if calling a government institution (insert bad word here) should be an example of a breach


[30-Apr-20 02:15 PM] dead#0701
rather a specific person


[30-Apr-20 02:15 PM] dead#0701

Can't anyone just claim they were joking?


[30-Apr-20 02:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
i mean in 60% of those cases it will be clear if they were


[30-Apr-20 02:19 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I agree with that as a substitute amendment for the amendment regarding not allowing slurs


[30-Apr-20 02:20 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
that's not a genuine quote though, not really


[30-Apr-20 02:20 PM] inactive#6974
I suppose


[30-Apr-20 02:21 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
To my understanding this wouldn't allow quoting, or "it's a joke" to be instant dismissals, it's just allowing them as defenses


[30-Apr-20 02:21 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
It's just saying "This is what we find acceptable, and what you can claim you were doing"


[30-Apr-20 02:22 PM] inactive#6974
Could something be included regarding attempts to get around the guidelines? "If a discord moderator or other moderator finds it inappropriate in the circumstances."


[30-Apr-20 02:23 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
The thing is getting around it wouldn't work imo


[30-Apr-20 02:23 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Since those are just available defenses they can claim, they can't just say it was a joke and then the mods can't punish them


[30-Apr-20 02:32 PM] NGSpy#8096
I think your suggestion to amend the COC is fair


[30-Apr-20 05:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Define slur


[30-Apr-20 05:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
And why does it matter if we use a slur to describe a government institution? Seems silly to want to protect a faceless group.


[30-Apr-20 05:49 PM] dead#0701
yeah thats also my thought on the gov institution


[30-Apr-20 05:49 PM] dead#0701
it's entirely different calling ASIO for example a rude word instead of an actual person


[30-Apr-20 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Plus we need to define what a slur is


[30-Apr-20 07:22 PM] RunasSudo#2416
The point is that if someone says “ASIO is a faggot” (whatever that's supposed to mean), it's offensive not against ASIO but against people who are gay.

It's the term itself that is problematic


[30-Apr-20 07:23 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I would say we shouldn't assume offense though


[30-Apr-20 07:23 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
In terms of say, acting on something like that which could be offensive but which nobody has actually been offended by


[30-Apr-20 07:23 PM] RunasSudo#2416
So then why is it necessary to introduce a new rule?


[30-Apr-20 07:25 PM] RunasSudo#2416
@NotGriffonomics Then that's going against what Lucifer says, and I don't see why using slurs in relation to organisations wouldn't be treated differently


[30-Apr-20 07:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I mean


[30-Apr-20 07:25 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
also better idea, how bout we wnforce the one we have and don't say the n word


[30-Apr-20 07:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[30-Apr-20 07:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I mean I can probably get it to be nsfw

{Reactions}
🤔 

[30-Apr-20 07:31 PM] RunasSudo#2416
That seems like a stretch. No one would flag e.g. a Reddit post for being NSFW because it “had the n word in it”. NSFW has an accepted meaning.


[30-Apr-20 07:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but the meaning in the const is stuff people dont wanna see if they at work or school


[30-Apr-20 07:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
no one wants to see a n


[30-Apr-20 07:36 PM] RunasSudo#2416
:yeahok:


[30-Apr-20 07:36 PM] RunasSudo#2416
And “numerous” means “relating to numbers” but no one would call 1 a numerous number. The term has an accepted usage.


[30-Apr-20 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and wrong is related to not being right but no one would call you right. This is an accepted usage of the word wrong

{Reactions}
yeahok 

[30-Apr-20 07:38 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I suppose fun YouTube videos are also NSFW then, because you wouldn't want to be seen goofing around at work or school

@NotGriffonomics yes sir


[04-May-20 05:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
this is kinda of a no shit sherlock thing, but change the date on the front cover and anywhere else that applies.


[04-May-20 05:34 PM] General_Rommel#0190
you should state at 2(2) that membership is a privilege to participation in discord because de facto that is the standard required now to join the discord server


[04-May-20 05:36 PM] General_Rommel#0190
At 2(6) I recommend simply saying 'Membership is withdrawn if a person is refused use of AustraliaSim for more than 21 days'.


[04-May-20 05:37 PM] NGSpy#8096
> An Vote of no confidence (VONC) is a Meta Referendum
This very grammer


[04-May-20 05:37 PM] General_Rommel#0190
At 4(3)(c) I do not understand what a 'approval vote' is


[04-May-20 05:39 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I do not see the purpose of s 5(2)(d) because that is basically the same as (c) in effect.


[04-May-20 05:41 PM] General_Rommel#0190
At s 6(3), 14 days is far too long. The maximum length of time should be 5 days.


[04-May-20 05:42 PM] General_Rommel#0190
To clarify, the maximum length of time should be 5 days from the moment seven seconders is found


[04-May-20 05:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Given we are a small, responsive simulation and not a giant organisation, a short timeframe is best.


[04-May-20 05:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
(there seems to be a minor drafting error at 7(1)(b))


[04-May-20 05:43 PM] NGSpy#8096
13 (2) when talking about ***Community Managers*** says "A member becomes a clerk"


[04-May-20 05:44 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I generally disagree with s 7(3) because it means e.g. if someone here moderates a popular subreddit community that has no relation to political simulations or even politics, then technically that person cannot be moderator


[04-May-20 05:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
in subsection 16, why does it talk about Justices???


[04-May-20 05:44 PM] General_Rommel#0190
So that prohibition should, in my view, be narrower


[04-May-20 05:45 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Certainly, but doesn't mean they can moderate different things. The problem as I see it is to prevent other people who moderate other _political simulations_ as that may be biased


[04-May-20 05:46 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Furthermore, if e.g. I end up moderating some anime subreddit that has only a few posts a day, should that disqualify me?


[04-May-20 05:47 PM] NGSpy#8096
21 (2) Example says "approve the meat rule". Thank you, very cool.


[04-May-20 05:47 PM] NGSpy#8096

[04-May-20 05:48 PM] NGSpy#8096
It does. It's very helpful.


[04-May-20 05:59 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I appreciate s 29(3) which basically validates my shoving in of a very complicated arrangement on how to decide to canonise or consider the operation of states/territories.


[04-May-20 06:02 PM] General_Rommel#0190
There is a minor spelling error at s 32(2)(b)


[04-May-20 06:02 PM] NGSpy#8096
There are quite a bit of spelling and grammar stuff


[04-May-20 06:02 PM] NGSpy#8096

right now it reads that its for irl conduct

can i ban hitler

no u


[05-May-20 12:47 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I see the purpose of this but I do think that this power should be tightened significantly. Also see my earlier comments on that provision.


[05-May-20 12:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
ok my one suggestion is that a reasonable timeframe should be added


[05-May-20 12:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so that i cant ban hitler for the sake of it


[05-May-20 12:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
or a future mod

4(2)(b) I think 14 days would be fairer than a month personally.


[05-May-20 12:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
5(3) just say that 5(2)(d) cannot be used on canonically appointed positions


[05-May-20 12:57 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[12-May-20 02:43 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Would this dispute body count as an office under the constitution moderators couldn't hold or would this allow the mods to bypass an appeals process by composing a dispute panel consisting of themselves

[12-May-20 02:55 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Also it seems to sort of defeat the purpose of an appeal if the mods choose who decides their appeal


[12-May-20 02:55 PM] dead#0701
I think the HCA should be the final place of appeal for any moderation/community dispute


[12-May-20 02:56 PM] dead#0701
the moderation review will have recommendations regarding the HCA too 👀


[12-May-20 02:57 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
As far as I know the point of having the HCA decide appeals was to have a body seperate from the mods


[12-May-20 02:58 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
A just in case kind of thing


[12-May-20 02:58 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
This change would sort of seem to defeat that purpose


[12-May-20 03:02 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
As such I would oppose that one provision


[12-May-20 03:02 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
The rest looks good though


[12-May-20 03:08 PM] inactive#6974
so we don't have an events team?


[12-May-20 03:10 PM] NGSpy#8096

[12-May-20 03:11 PM] NGSpy#8096
check more below


[12-May-20 03:18 PM] inactive#6974
it only mentions them twice


[12-May-20 03:44 PM] RunasSudo#2416
Part 5 – should clarify that "election" includes "referendum", "plebiscite" or any similar matter


[12-May-20 04:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
First question: Does the event conflict with an existing event in the AustraliaSim canon? If no it is not canon. Surely if it does conflict it isn't canon and if it doesn't conflict then it is


[12-May-20 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
The next two should also be canon, canon should be the default unless it conflicts with something in AusSim. Excluding legislation passed unless it is a minor financial instruments and/or department regulation change that is required for the basic function of government


[12-May-20 04:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
In your example of the event leading to school closures. The event should be canon but if the government of the day decides to respond by closing schools then the school closing shouldnt be canon


[12-May-20 05:24 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Perhaps


[12-May-20 05:25 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
However, the answer to that is not to strip the power of the court, rather to reform the selection of justices


[12-May-20 05:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I have always seen it to ensure that the meta branch is checked


[12-May-20 05:27 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Yes I replied to the modmail


[12-May-20 05:29 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I have two concerns with that provision really.
The first, is that I feel instead of stripping away the HCA as being the point of appeal, we should reform the selection of justices.
The second, is who would serve on such a panel. If the mods can simply compose a panel of whoever they like to hear appeals, it sort of defeats the purpose of a check imo


[12-May-20 05:32 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
If we insist upon creating a seperate panel, having it elected is probably the best choice


[12-May-20 05:32 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I can side with Lucifer's comments


[12-May-20 05:33 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
My first preference would be that we keep it as it is with the HCA as the appeal point, but I also recognize I am biased in that regard


[12-May-20 05:34 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
It's a better option than mod appointments


[12-May-20 05:34 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Because that really isn't an option at all


[12-May-20 05:35 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
At that point it's just a rubber stamp


[12-May-20 05:35 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Not really a check anymore


[12-May-20 10:22 PM] Deleted User#0000

It's just another layer of mods that are beholden to the mods

I mean imo it just doesn't make sense to have the people whose decisions will be appealed picking the people who will decide the appeals

[16-May-20 11:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
At least that is better telling me where I can find it though when I first asked it was when this was posted "It is my intention tommorow to introduce the updated AustraliaSim Meta Constitution to be voted on with 5 days notice (so some time next week). This will result in mostly clarrification of powers and a redelegation of powers."


[16-May-20 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
Since it was his intention to introduce it when I first asked I could only assume that it had not being posted when it was still only an intention

is it too late to propose an amendment to the constitution?


[17-May-20 10:28 AM] General_Rommel#0190
probably is I think


[17-May-20 01:06 PM] General_Rommel#0190
To add a provision to require a state of the simulation report be delivered


[17-May-20 01:06 PM] General_Rommel#0190
at 4 to 6 month intervals or so


[17-May-20 01:07 PM] General_Rommel#0190
You can set the trend


[17-May-20 01:08 PM] General_Rommel#0190
But I do think they should be semi serious, set some goals, areas of improvement and what the moderation team thinks they need to work on, etc.


[17-May-20 01:08 PM] General_Rommel#0190
and any good achievements or standouts that were enjoyed by the community


[17-May-20 01:13 PM] General_Rommel#0190

There's nothing "wrong" with it but there is a lot of cruft that has accumulated, e.g. old meta provisions (it still nominally says AusSim is run by the Governor-General) which weren't updated when Meta Constitutions were adopted or updated

I expect the intention is just to clean it out and get rid of all the meta stuff (which no longer applies anyway). I don't expect there would be any actual changes to how anything works.


[16-Jun-20 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
So it will be a Bill to correct this old stuff rather than going back to our current irl one?


[16-Jun-20 09:05 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I expect the change would be effected directly by the Moderators, rather than by a canon Bill/referendum

There is sometimes a bit of spam in announcements that can be reduced, but some of these examples are pretty poor


[24-Jun-20 08:06 PM] RunasSudo#2416
A Discord Mod announcing their absence is very reasonable

Well I wasn't going to nitpick, but if you insist on making a point of the number, the AustLII announcement, 850 debates, ❤️ in response to nitro boosting and Antony Green comment were also in the realm of reasonability


[24-Jun-20 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Green's post has nothing to do with AusSim and could easily be placed in the elections channel since it's about that. Same with AustLII, nothing to do with AusSim

I do use announcements to see what major meta things are going on, because frankly all the important notices are sometimes buried under meme posts.

It wasn't created to tell people about some pacific island having another election.

It wasn't created to tell each other about how we are captains

It wasn't created to post about how woke a member is or not

@NotGriffonomics let's put it this way since the population of aboriginals is only 2% of the population does that mean we shouldn't worry about issues that only affect them? We can safely ignore them because we are only a democracy?

@Deleted User I took a poll to see if there was demand to keep them and there wasnt


[09-Aug-20 09:47 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I wanted to get rid of subscribables as those channels got no use because no one knew they were there


[09-Aug-20 09:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I prefer having open channels that people can see (and mute if they don't want) rather than an opt-in mechanism that very few actually knew about and used.


[09-Aug-20 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean the whole point of subscribeables was so there wasn't a huge list of channels for people to scroll through and only see what they want.


[09-Aug-20 11:14 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I believe that there has been an increase in activity with the change.


[09-Aug-20 11:14 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
The number of channels is basically the same

I will have to make that soon


[22-Sep-20 05:46 PM] General_Rommel#0190
Good afternoon,

I will soon be moving to general consultations some amendments I have planned but I will be discussing this with @deleted-role members first:

The first is some possible changes to formalise a better hurdle requirement for appointments to meta positions to be worded into the Meta Constitution. I am still waiting on the handbooks so I can't do a comparison, but the general pointers are the following:

1. The Moderation Team should only discount a candidate if they explicitly explain why they should not be on the ballot. If they do so, it must be only where the candidate is ineligible, has committed prior misconduct, or has demonstrated an inability to hold the position.
2. There is a presumption that if a candidate meets a certain number of seconders, the Moderation Team must, unless (1) applies, put the nominee to the vote.
3. The number of seconders required is:
Moderation Team - 7
All other positions unless otherwise listed- 5
Community Commission - 3

The second is that, following the recent Meta Votes held, I noticed that the lead-in time for people to become able to vote after having their membership approved took way too long. At the moment, it is 28 days. I plan to change this to 7 days.

These will be formally proposed when the handbooks are delivered to me and I can write these amendments in (alongside ancillary changes to correct spelling mistakes etc.).

Comments and constructive feedback will be appreciated.


[22-Sep-20 05:48 PM] NGSpy#8096
I feel these changes are satsifactory.


[23-Sep-20 12:15 AM] RunasSudo#2416

I don't want to direct you guys specifically but in particular I want guidance on what the community feels is currently over/under policed, and what areas of the CoC are currently too vague/over defined.

I have been handed by @Inactive the original report from last time I asked. If the commission has anything on top of what was said in that document (or fresh ideas now that we are 4 months down the line) that would be appreciated.


[30-Sep-20 04:41 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
@deleted-role hey all, I wanted to gauge opinions as to whether we should add a channel to the server called something like #new-member-welcome where (once someone passes validation) new members can say hello and ask questions rather than being bombarded in #deleted-channel. Any comments either way?


[30-Sep-20 04:42 PM] inactive#6974
I don't see the need for this, because I know many times, they are taken them to #deleted-channel or #deleted-channel or even DMs to speak about this


[30-Sep-20 04:42 PM] NGSpy#8096
I think thats a pretty neet idea.


[30-Sep-20 04:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I guess the idea is having something for that one time that both generals are used


[30-Sep-20 04:43 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I don't want to use AMA for it because its more for asking the mods stuff / debating meta concerns


[30-Sep-20 04:44 PM] inactive#6974
it's a very rare event that happens and I think you could just use #validation , or just DMs, I know that I have used DMs.


[30-Sep-20 04:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
DMs would work yes


[30-Sep-20 04:45 PM] inactive#6974
We already have arguably too many channels already so I don't see the need for it


[30-Sep-20 04:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
the issue with #validation is that this is for when they have already been validated


[30-Sep-20 04:45 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I mean, I don't see the issue with a lot of channels but respect that its a view people have


[30-Sep-20 04:46 PM] inactive#6974
well it could be even more overwhelming to new members lol


[30-Sep-20 04:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I mean if there is a dedicated channel for new players I dont see how that is more overwhelming


[30-Sep-20 04:48 PM] inactive#6974
as in the amount of channels we have


[30-Sep-20 04:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
give me 1 sec


[30-Sep-20 04:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'll do some math


[30-Sep-20 04:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
a new user (once validated) can see 44 channels of which they can type in 25 of them. Most of the ones they can't type in are at the top. The two generals and meta affair are the first they can type in

I motion for an inquiry into the State of AustraliaSim.
The details shall be worked out within the Community Commission.

[05-Dec-20 09:17 AM] NGSpy#8096
I feel that would be a good idea. What would you suggest personally?


[05-Dec-20 09:22 AM] General_Rommel#0190
Personally I think 3 weeks, which will give enough time to implement any recommendations.


[05-Dec-20 09:24 AM] inactive#6974
Please clarify what you mean by the "state of australiasim"


[05-Dec-20 09:25 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
My assumption is a review of the meta functioning of the sim


[05-Dec-20 09:25 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
As we had previously


[05-Dec-20 09:25 AM] NGSpy#8096
This.


[05-Dec-20 09:25 AM] inactive#6974
Ah


[05-Dec-20 09:25 AM] NGSpy#8096
I wish to make it less closed off though and get the opinions of many people outside of the Community Commission.


[05-Dec-20 09:26 AM] NGSpy#8096
Because I think last time it was just the community commission, and it didn't necessarily represent the views of everyone.


[05-Dec-20 09:26 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
There's nothing wrong with that, although at a certain point one might as well just do a community poll on all the relevant issues


[05-Dec-20 09:28 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Additionally, the community commision is here to represent the community on these things. Obviously asking for opinions isn't a bad thing, but the point is for us to do these things on their behalf


[05-Dec-20 09:29 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I mean I don't object to the general gathering of opinion, but if we try to figure out what everyone thinks, we might as well skip the inquiry and go straight to community poll as that's essentially what we'd be doing


[05-Dec-20 09:29 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
And it would save time


[05-Dec-20 09:35 AM] NGSpy#8096
I think using #community-poll would be inefficient if we want to get a proper gage on what people disagree with. I think interviewing people who have interacted with the simulator in the past 6 months would be a good start as it would not only gage the views of current AustraliaSimmers but also those who left. I did identify a big point in my meta post being that people do leave, they spread rumours about the simulator as a whole and it becomes a one way transaction out of here a lot of the time.


[05-Dec-20 09:38 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I'm not sure about the realism, or even desirability of tracking down everyone from the last 6 months to talk to them.

Additionally, with all respect to those people, they left, and if we're not talking to them now, they stayed gone. I hardly think we should be making changes for people who aren't even members of the sim. 

I'm far more concerned about concerns that current members may have


[05-Dec-20 09:45 AM] NGSpy#8096
of course we wouldn't get *everyone* but it'd be worth a shot.
> Additionally, with all respect to those people, they left, and if we're not talking to them now, they stayed gone. I hardly think we should be making changes for people who aren't even members of the sim. 
well I think there would be some interesting perspective gained. Of course one would note these people separately in the process in order to get individual data on what people currently occupying the simulator want, but fundamentally it should see where it goes wrong, and often where it goes wrong is where people feel that the best option is to leave.
Of course they may do it for personal reasons, I acknowledge that, but I bet some would have had some dissatisfaction with the way the simulator was run specifically as well.


[05-Dec-20 08:37 PM] General_Rommel#0190
The point of the Community Commission, in my view, is that given the fact that members of the community have been elected to this position that your views will reflect the community. I think it is right to at least seek commentary from the broader community on this, but I also do think that the Commission ought to speak in one voice, as strongly as possible, as to provide direction to the Moderation Team as to what future steps should be undertaken in a principled fashion. I, and the rest of the Team I would presume, rely on the Commission to filter and digest the views of the community in such a way as to give good feedback to us on what we should do.

I leave it up to the Community Commission on how to do this, but I think given how things are organised, coming back on the 28th December 2020 (just over three weeks) would be the most suitable timeframe.


[05-Dec-20 08:38 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I also think the best thing to start with is to determine what exactly are the areas of focus. Perhaps NGSpy's recent post would be a good place to start?


[05-Dec-20 09:40 PM] NGSpy#8096
I feel that Rommel's suggestions are perfectly practical.


[07-Jan-21 11:30 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Hello members of the community commission, I come with an idea. I was wondering if it is time to replace the old JP thread system with a system of a google form to apply, so that members can be logged on the spreadsheet and flairs etc can be managed easier. Does anyone have comment on this? Just seeking opinions at this stage.

Hrmmm. Sounds quite interesting.


[07-Jan-21 11:33 AM] General_Rommel#0190
I do not agree. I like the transperency of the jp system even though it is a bit clunky

[07-Jan-21 11:34 AM] NGSpy#8096
I might feel it would be practical to create a separate ping for the bot to like a clerk or a validator to make sure that the flairs were applied correctly.


[07-Jan-21 11:41 AM] NGSpy#8096
oh right back to the inquiry thing:
I feel we should distribute the load of questions across topic areas, like:
- The Houses of Parliament
- The Press/Events
- Campaigning/Party Registration
- The High Court
- Community Management/Code of Conduct
- Meta Procedures
And then we could create some questions which would allow for an open forum of feedback.
We would interview any members of the simulator that wish to participate in the inquiry and present their thoughts and feelings on certain issues of the community.
but first I will link my musings and we can publicly discuss about them and what we agree or disagree about them.


[15-Jan-21 08:26 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I agree with this and I hope that the Commission moves forward with these laudable aims.


[16-Jan-21 12:37 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969

[04-Feb-21 07:46 PM] General_Rommel#0190
I am curious what the @deleted-role thinks of the proposal by Slater in #community-poll


[04-Feb-21 07:49 PM] NGSpy#8096
I honestly believe it's an interesting idea to consider


[04-Feb-21 07:56 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I have seen these systems in other sims, and they work fine. I think it would be a good idea, both reducing the clutter of the subreddits, while making it easier for members to vote on everything, while also making it a little easier for speakership because they don't have to make 6 million posts


[04-Feb-21 07:56 PM] General_Rommel#0190
My gut instinct is that it would be a good change so long as each voting thread has the business number in the title (to ensure searchability).

Hello,

The Community Commission will be utilising its new powers of looking over meta court issues, to deal with the case Griffo v SDP.

2 members of the 6 member Community Commission, Griffonomics and NGSpy will not be present due to Conflicts of Interest. 

If you believe that this actions contravene any rules and regulations as per the Meta Constitution, or other similar documents, canon or meta, please direct those issues to the Moderation Team.

We will endeavour to get a result as soon as possible, and appreciate your patience in the mean time.

@deleted-role I feel it is right, in order to assist the Community Managers with the moderation of the simulator and for people to know what AustraliaSim is about and is not about, we should come up with some shared values by all members.


[23-Jun-21 04:21 PM] Pav#1147
Yes.


[23-Jun-21 04:21 PM] NGSpy#8096
Okay cool


[23-Jun-21 04:21 PM] NGSpy#8096
I'll start by suggesting some


[23-Jun-21 04:23 PM] NGSpy#8096
1. AustraliaSim is a community where all political discussions should be in good stead with no personal commentary. *(Eg. Personal insults or unwarranted accusations)*
2. AustraliaSim values all members of the community in an equal light and respects their values and beliefs to a tolerable degree.
You can change the wording but you get the idea


[23-Jun-21 04:23 PM] NGSpy#8096
@Pav you got any you'd like to put in


[23-Jun-21 04:47 PM] Ash#8178
@NGSpy how about, all political discussions should be in good stead with no personal commentary


[23-Jun-21 04:49 PM] NGSpy#8096
sure. that seems cool


[23-Jun-21 08:53 PM] inactive#6974
where **all political discussions**


[23-Jun-21 08:54 PM] NGSpy#8096
okay, what should we replace the wording with


[23-Jun-21 08:54 PM] inactive#6974
This is all subjective and interpreted differently by each person, and therefore community managers.


[23-Jun-21 08:55 PM] inactive#6974
What say, mikiboss believes is to a tolerable degree, may be different to Youma's, different to AMN's thoughts


[23-Jun-21 09:00 PM] inactive#6974
The community commission needs to do some community outreach to see what they believe should be changed in terms of day to day moderation. This included what topics should community managers steer away from. Does the community believe that NSFW discussion in AusSim is a problem? If so, to what extent are we defining NSFW? Does the community have any particular grievances with how certain discussions have been handle? Does the community believe that we need to come down harder on ironic bigotry and baiting?


[23-Jun-21 09:00 PM] inactive#6974
@NGSpy you feel me?


[23-Jun-21 09:01 PM] NGSpy#8096
😔 ok fair enuff


[23-Jun-21 09:03 PM] inactive#6974
shared values are cool and whatever but it's not going to change the alleged problems we are currently experiencing, and the way to address that is to get feedback from the community, and then for the community commission + moderation team to look over this feedback and then determine what we see is considered an issue and then present some solutions.


[23-Jun-21 09:06 PM] inactive#6974
