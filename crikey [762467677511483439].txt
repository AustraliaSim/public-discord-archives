As reported in the ABC, the Deputy (?) Prime Minister, and Liberal MP for Lingiari, ThanksHeadMod has come out with a strongly worded statement, in which he calls a "Letter of Demand to the Italian Government."


[10-Mar-21 11:31 AM] inactive#6974
In this letter of demand, the DPM claims that the Italian Government is  "violating our property rights.", adding that the Draghi Government is "[trespassing] upon our land and denying us the fundamental right to use things we own."


[10-Mar-21 11:36 AM] inactive#6974
While it is strongly worded, this is pale in comparison to the final two paragraphs of the letter.


[10-Mar-21 11:37 AM] inactive#6974
The Deputy Prime Minister threatened to pass laws which will
- ban all trade to Italy
- strip any property of the Italian government, such as shares, stocks and bonds,
- prevent Italians from leaving our country


[10-Mar-21 11:38 AM] inactive#6974
Further adding "We may even invade Italy and take your land."


[10-Mar-21 11:57 AM] inactive#6974
This is in direct contradiction to previous statements from this government, including a tweet where the Department of Home Affairs tweeted, "There is 0 problem for us with Italians holding back our vaccine shipment."


[10-Mar-21 11:58 AM] inactive#6974
The Member for Brisbane announced on Twitter, "We just figured why not take the opportunity to stick it to the Italians again?".


[10-Mar-21 11:59 AM] inactive#6974
This was followed by the DPM letting loose on twitter, declaring "FUCK ITALY."


[10-Mar-21 12:02 PM] inactive#6974
This is extremely concerning behaviour, from the Government declaring it as a non/minor issues, to escalate into threats of war.


[10-Mar-21 12:05 PM] inactive#6974
There are fears for the Italian communities residing in Australia, as we saw with Asian Australian communities experiencing anti china sentiment, events like these do lead to increased bigotry and incidents of harrassment. With the DPM threatening, as mentioned above to "Prevent Italians from leaving our country."

** LGBT+ Rights groups voice concern about the Member for Hotham’s position on the Barriers to Blood Donation amendments put forward by Prime Minister Griffonomics**

[12-Mar-21 03:39 PM] kyōsantō#0087
A plethora of Gay Rights Groups have come out against the position of Democrats MP GHagrids vote in support of the Amendments put forward to the recent Sex Discrimination Amendment Act, which where introduced by Griffonomics, which sought to change the current Blood Donation Laws to discriminate against Gay and Bisexual Men, and their ability to donate blood, based on irrelevant reasoning, that ignores current medical science and the simple fact that Blood Banks test all blood regardless, of who provides it.


[12-Mar-21 03:40 PM] kyōsantō#0087
.


[12-Mar-21 03:40 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Some 1 in 10 people according to recent estimates identify as LGBT+ in Australia, and the Prime Ministers amendments seek to prevent 10% of the Australian population from giving blood. Some Gay Rights groups such as Regional Queers Australia said this was “simply embarrasing for the Government” and “demonstrated the complete homophobic agenda of the PM”.


[12-Mar-21 03:40 PM] kyōsantō#0087
.


[12-Mar-21 03:40 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Dandenong Queer Health Network said that “while they always knew the Prime Minister and his Government showed little care or respect for the LGBT community, it was an absolute surprise that our very own Member would vote in favour of such clearly homophobic amendments.” It also came as a surprise considering that the Democrats Leader, Mr Matthias Caesar voted against the amendments, and that the Australian Democrats have a history of social liberalism and a general support for the LGBT+ community, which is why local Gay Community leader Mr Aaron Witrand said “that this is an embarrassing moment for the Democrats and especially in the Division of Hotham that is home to Midsumma Pride March, and a large LGBT community in places like St. Kilda, and Prahran.”


[12-Mar-21 03:40 PM] kyōsantō#0087
.


[12-Mar-21 03:40 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Transgender activists also raised concerns over how these amendments would have impacted their ability to donate blood, with Ms. Holly Jones of South Metro Trans Health telling us “that the amendments were unclear in their definition of male, and knowing the Prime Minister and his beliefs, would such legislation be extended to impact pre-surgery transwomen? It is simply unclear what the intentions are here, besides naturally being homophobic and transphobic in nature.” Going on to say “how exactly would this work with non-binary and gender non-conforming people? It is simply a poor amendment, and I wholeheartedly support the Senator for Tasmania's Bill to improve Blood Donation rules for all Australians.”


[12-Mar-21 03:40 PM] kyōsantō#0087

[12-Mar-21 03:41 PM] kyōsantō#0087
The previous Member for Hotham, Senator Mad_Bear_O_Melbourne gave a statement to Crikey! Saying “the man who campaigned on the red scare is also voting to reintroduce red scare era queer discrimination. The Australian Democrats are supposedly centrist but this is a clear conservative policy. I suppose the fact the all blood donations are tested for diseases is not a fact that matters in this case, but what do I know, I'm a dirty gay so my blood isn't useful.”


[12-Mar-21 03:41 PM] kyōsantō#0087

[12-Mar-21 03:41 PM] kyōsantō#0087
The Red Scare campaigning referring to the widely condemned scare campaign by the Australian Democrats against their coalition partner at the time, the Green Left Party, calling them ‘Communist’ and saying they were ‘all aesthetics’, with Crikey! Asking community members on the street what they had to say.

[12-Mar-21 03:41 PM] kyōsantō#0087
53 year old Kew resident Mrs. Leanne Lowly asked whether GHagrid “thought that gay rights were all just aesthetics?” Stating “It seems ironic that they campaigned on common sense policy but have voted instead in favour of blatant homophobia.”

[12-Mar-21 03:42 PM] kyōsantō#0087
36 year old Camberwell father of 3 Mr. Glen Jacobs saying that “[he] was drawn to the Centrist agenda of the Democrats, but this has made me seriously reconsider, as my member willingly voted for amendments that sought to deny myself and my husband the ability to donate blood.”

Cranbourne man Mr. Kenneth Walker stated that it was “the right thing for GHagrid to do, so as to protect the recipients of blood donations from HIV and AIDS.” Mr. Walker said that he “remembered the 80s well and was worried about the possibility of another AIDS crisis caused by ||p*ofs|| [sic], and was glad the Dems had stood with the Nationals in keeping Australia safe.”

[12-Mar-21 03:42 PM] kyōsantō#0087
With the Amendments failing in the House, LGBT+ activists voiced happiness with this outcome. However, for an electorate with such a high level of LGBT+ constituents, it is unclear what exactly the Member for Hotham was intending to achieve by throwing his support behind said amendments. With many members in the community calling him homophobic, leading to widespread concern that the left leaning electorate had made the wrong choice in voting for a centrist candidate, they thought would offer a better voice and more opportunities for the region.


[12-Mar-21 03:42 PM] kyōsantō#0087

[12-Mar-21 03:43 PM] kyōsantō#0087
With the next election fast approaching it remains to be seen what the Member for Hotham can do to regain the trust of his constituents, and for the Australian Democrats to be seen as having any form of integrity on Gay and Trans Rights.

HI BESTIES


[02-May-21 09:16 AM] inactive#6974
it's been a while, so it's time for Crikey!'s election predictions!


[02-May-21 09:16 AM] inactive#6974
Crikey!


[02-May-21 09:16 AM] inactive#6974
Let's get into it.


[02-May-21 09:20 AM] inactive#6974
The 20th General Election has been an unusual campaign, with senior figures such as the Prime Minister Griffonomics,  Leader of the Opposition Matthias_Caesar and Shadow Treasurer GHagrid have decided to leave their incumbent electorate to contest the Senate, Nicholls and Denison respectively. It's been a campaign of surprises, with what seems to be Green Left and National preferences deals against the Australian Democrats, and a strong SDP electorate campaign that rose out of nowhere!


[02-May-21 09:35 AM] inactive#6974
Crikey had their team all across the country, recording campaign events, to bring you a record of how strong each party's campaign was!


[02-May-21 09:38 AM] inactive#6974
The results are in, with the Nationals taking first place, followed by the Democrats taking silver, snubbing Green Left who take bronze!

[02-May-21 09:42 AM] inactive#6974
An important factor to note here is that this does not take into account the quality of the event, and the impact it would have on voters. Nonetheless it's certainly interesting data that can give *some* indication of how the result may go!


[02-May-21 09:44 AM] inactive#6974
Already you can see where the strongest National campaign lay, in the Senate, with the Leader Griffonomics and Deputy Leader buttsforpm running, aided by the Sydney MP who was elected as an independent, but defected to the Nationals, former Prime Minister Riley8583!

*Candidates:*
Randy173 - NAT
**NGSpy - SDP **
ChainChompsky - GLP
artemisjasper - CLP


**Bold denotes incumbent**


[02-May-21 10:08 AM] inactive#6974
A safe call for the SDP here, with no real challenge put against him. NGSpy held 3 campaign events to the Nationals 2 and Green Left's 1. With NGSpy receiving both GLP and CLP preferences, and his personal popularity, it'll be a retain for the father of the house. The Nationals may benefit slightly from appearing at the top of the ballot.

[02-May-21 10:24 AM] inactive#6974
No incumbent in this race, and this puts eternal CLP candidates BestinBounds in high contention to take the seat. A surprise SDP challenger in former UDP MP Perekai has campaigned extremely well, and both could end up around the same first preference vote. Unfortunately for the SDP both the National and Green Left candidates who have run minor but not insignificant campaigns, their preferences will flow to the CLP, making it extremely likely that the CLP will pick up the seat.


**HIGHLY LIKELY CLP GAIN**

**MAYO**

*Candidates:*
**cool_santa - CLP - 2**
JosephB2002 - NAT - 3
blueknight2004 - AD - 6
motelblinds - GLP - 4
ellielia - SDP - 5
model-vivienne - IND - 1


[02-May-21 10:38 AM] inactive#6974
Mayo has been an interesting race, with no strong campaigner clearly taking the lead. Both the CLP and the Dems have had 6 events, followed by the SDP and Nats with 5, model-vivienne with 2 and then no sign of the Green Left candidate. 

While blueknight probably ran the strongest campaign, it's clear this race will come down to preferences, and with Green Left, model-vivienne, the Nationals and the SDP preferencing the CLP, if the CLP manage to have a first preference in the top 2 or even 3, it's looking highly likely they will take the seat. This isn't a confident call, but with the preferences broadly being anti-democrat, it certainly helps. An incumbent advantage also helps the CLP.

Strong SDP campaign against AD Candidate, again with the Liberal off to the senate, it's an open race. Honestly a close call, with the SDP candidate a bigger image and known in the electorate, should put them on top but preferences will aid the AusDems. At the moment I'm calling this for the AusDems, with zero confidence.

Today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, SDP Senator for the Northern Territory dyljam cast a vote against the bill.


[15-Jun-21 09:15 PM] inactive#6974
This is the current status of the votes.

**Ayes:** 2 (NAT)
**Noes:** 3 (1 CLP, 1 GRN, 1 SDP)

**Still to vote:** 2 (1 NAT, 1 GRN)


[15-Jun-21 09:17 PM] inactive#6974
With confirmation that the Greens are strongly whipping against the bill to avoid the disunity they demonstrated in the lower house, it looks unlikely that this Government's landmark legislation will pass.


[15-Jun-21 09:18 PM] inactive#6974
This also comes after the defeat of the Government's water reform, where all parties excluding the government opposed the legislation, sending it down 6-2.

Youmaton, former Prime Minister and former Member for Canberra, as well as a plethora of former other things, has announced their intention to contest Nicholls.


[15-Jun-21 09:35 PM] inactive#6974
This is a surprising move considering their focus has mostly been regarding advocacy for statehood of the ACT. Youmaton and model-putrid are Independents in this race, alongside Nationals candidate 12MaxWild and Country Labor candidate model-frod. The Liberal Party, The Greens, Australian Democrats and Social Democrats are yet to announce candidates.

[04-Jul-21 07:49 PM] inactive#6974
In a free, transparent democracy, it’s vital that our politicians are held accountable for their actions and communities should be aware about how their representatives are supposedly representing them.


[04-Jul-21 07:50 PM] inactive#6974
Part of being an elected representative is turning up to divisions and debates to represent the views and policies that your constituents elected you for.


[04-Jul-21 07:51 PM] inactive#6974
Today, Crikey will be looking at our parliament on the numbers. Who's missing votes? Who has introduced bills and motions?


[04-Jul-21 07:51 PM] inactive#6974
Firstly, let’s have a glance at the parties voting turnout before heading into individual MPs. Please note that this data is accurate as of the cycle ending on the 1st of July 2021, as the current cycle is yet to end.


[04-Jul-21 07:52 PM] inactive#6974
The formula used to calculate this total party turnout is done through dividing the sum of the attended divisions in the House of Representatives and the Senate by the total eligible divisions. For example, if the Greens attended 70 divisions in the House and Senate, and they were eligible to vote in 100, the equation would be 70/100, = 70%. Now, if for 10 of these, an MP was on leave, it would make them only eligible for 90, not 100, and therefore the equation would be 70/90, = 77.8%.


[04-Jul-21 07:52 PM] inactive#6974
**So let’s get into it! **


[04-Jul-21 07:54 PM] inactive#6974
In **first place** we have the **Greens**, with a total turnout of 90.91%. Their House turnout is 86.99%, and their Senate turnout 97.33%. They’ll be glad, as any other party would to end up on top of the voting turnout, and missing only 2 divisions in the senate has certainly helped them achieve this, with their MPs slightly letting them down.


[04-Jul-21 07:55 PM] inactive#6974
So who is in **second place**? We have the **Country Labor Party**, with 88.24%. Once again, their house turnout lets them down slightly, sitting at 78.57%, with their Senate turnout at 97.67%. With the new inclusion of model-frod as an MP, their house turnout has improved and it’s expected their house turnout will continue to rise.


[04-Jul-21 07:58 PM] inactive#6974
Sitting pretty in **third**, is the **Social Democrats** at 84.11%. A house turnout of 80.12%, but a Senate turnout of 100.00%. The Social Democrat's representation is house heavy, hence the overall turnout a lot closer to that of the house than the seat. 84% is 4% behind 2nd place, but overall not a bad turnout.


[04-Jul-21 08:01 PM] inactive#6974
Coming in **fourth** is the **Liberal Party**, with a turnout across both houses of **75.00%**. Their house representation has now ceased to exist but was abysmal, at only **37.14%**, whereas their Senate representation has a total turnout of **85.27%**. Unlike the other parties, the Liberals have attended most divisions in the senate.


[04-Jul-21 08:04 PM] inactive#6974
In fifth, there's the **Australian Democrats**, dropping to 70.31%. While the senate has a turnout of 79.07%, the house is at only 65.88%, which is around 1 in every 3 votes being missed. A disappointing turnout for a party in government, and they should be thankful that the parliament has generally been amiable to the government's legislation.


[04-Jul-21 08:06 PM] inactive#6974
Coming in last place is the **Independents** who have representation in the MP for Moncrieff, tbyrn21. tbyrn21 has attended less than half the divisions he should have attended, and has a final turnout figure of 48.57%. With not long to go until an election, this turnout could become a campaign point for his opponents who seek to take away his incumbency.

[04-Jul-21 08:20 PM] inactive#6974
It's likely that these parliamentarians will be facing challenges in their electorates given the upcoming election, and little time to improve.


[04-Jul-21 08:34 PM] inactive#6974
In other news,

The Government has been defeated narrowly in a shock upset in the Denison by-election, with the their candidate from the Democrats, but additionally endorsed by the SDP realDarkpulsar, losing out to the Greens candidate, PuzzledWaste, who had briefly represented Tasmania in the senate. While July 1 electorate polling had the Democrats 19 points above the Greens in the first preference votes, PuzzledWaste overcame the polling to come out on top of the first preference vote by 6.7%, and preferences from TheSensibleCentre and Inadorable sealed the deal for the Greens, sending them back up to 4 seats in the lower house. 

This result for the Government leaves them without a majority in the house, holding 7 out of the 14 seats, with Brisbane vacant following the resignation of Liberal Leader GenericCerealHere. Leader of the Opposition, Greens Senator, later_slater1407\_ announced on twitter last night that the Greens "will not be moving a vote of no confidence in the Government", even in the event that the government does not win back it's majority, and called for greater negotiation between the Government and the parliament.

@Gregor The Beggar shawty?


[04-Jul-21 09:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Hello!


[04-Jul-21 09:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@inactive


[04-Jul-21 09:01 PM] inactive#6974
What are your thoughts on the performance of the parties this term?


[04-Jul-21 09:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm more than happy as well to talk about the by-elections as well though as I have political "takes" on that as well


[04-Jul-21 09:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So fundamentally, there are obvious questions to be had mainly for the Member for Canberra and the Member for Moncrieff


[04-Jul-21 09:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But I don't think we can easily dismiss the effects of their turnout to the electorate


[04-Jul-21 09:03 PM] inactive#6974
Why so?


[04-Jul-21 09:03 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
A famous example of this is obviously in regards to the old Mr Bob Katter who by todays standard has a fairly abysmal turnout


[04-Jul-21 09:03 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But he remained electable in his electorate and was very popular there


[04-Jul-21 09:04 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
More recent examples include people like Ho Ho Ho for example who remained electorally popular despite his relative low turnout


[04-Jul-21 09:04 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So absolutely we cannot dismiss them in this regard when it comes to turnout


[04-Jul-21 09:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The main regard for voters is obviously instead going to be mainly about whether their MP is actually doing anything while in office


[04-Jul-21 09:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
This proves a problem for someone like Entraptra12 who hasn't been sighted at all recently and proves a problem, albeit lesser, for someone like Tbyrn21


[04-Jul-21 09:07 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So obviously voting turnout is an indicator but I'd watch their Parliamentary record and then go down to the people of the electorate


[04-Jul-21 09:07 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I shared a smoke with a man from Canberra, a "doobie" if you would, a long while back though I no longer partake in drugs beyond Yaqona these days


[04-Jul-21 09:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and while I was smoking in that seedy parlour, I believe it was French, he started going off about his local MP and how everyone voted AusDems in regards to Matthias Caesar but now all that goodwill and loyalty might be lost


[04-Jul-21 09:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Especially in a very hostile electorate like Canberra which has frequently been a battleground


[04-Jul-21 09:10 PM] inactive#6974
Do you think the Democrats representatives in the Senate voting down a bill to have a referendum on ACT Statehood may also impact on the electorate?


[04-Jul-21 09:10 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Oh absolutely, I think it may ultimately be what brings down all of that Australian Democrats goodwill in the electorate.


[04-Jul-21 09:10 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We can't forget that the former Member for Canberra, who the current member owes a lot of gratitude to for making a firm electorate for her, ran on a explicit pro-statehood campaign during his time


[04-Jul-21 09:11 PM] inactive#6974
Indeed.


[04-Jul-21 09:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and so to vote against their own statehood campaign bid is going to be a very damaging look electorally


[04-Jul-21 09:17 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@inactive Anyway let's talk about the two recent by-elections shall we?


[04-Jul-21 09:17 PM] inactive#6974

[04-Jul-21 09:17 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

[04-Jul-21 09:18 PM] inactive#6974

[04-Jul-21 09:18 PM] inactive#6974
The Government suffering a loss in a by-election where they picked up 70.2% of the vote in Federal Election is not a good look by any means.


[04-Jul-21 09:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'd say it is quite literally positively dreadful for them as a matter of fact, additionally in the case where it solidifies their current loss of majority


[04-Jul-21 09:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The entire Parliament as it stands and the Government's legislative agenda and budgetary agenda are reliant on the Independent Member for Moncrieff voting with them


[04-Jul-21 09:20 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Considering this term has proven a hostile Senate to the Government, it seems the same is happening with a hostile House


[04-Jul-21 09:20 PM] inactive#6974
What are your thoughts on the Greens' announcement regarding a potential vote of no confidence? Do you think it gives the image of a weak opposition?


[04-Jul-21 09:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Not at all, I think it gives the image of a very ambitious opposition


[04-Jul-21 09:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
If the vote fails, it seems unlikely to do more than be a temporary blow and embarrasment


[04-Jul-21 09:22 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Same with the Nicholls by-election result where the Greens were very much more embarrassed there


[04-Jul-21 09:24 PM] inactive#6974
Definitely.


[04-Jul-21 09:24 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Of course there's a chance that Tbyrn doesn't show up, Government MPs don't show up


[04-Jul-21 09:25 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Oh I'm sorry I just realized I've gotten confused


[04-Jul-21 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would like to ask you a question, Gregor.


[04-Jul-21 09:25 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@inactive In regards to their actual statement which they made announcing they would not conduct a Vote of No Confidence, I think it does show principle but ultimately I believe they have the numbers


[04-Jul-21 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
What is the best Chief Keef record?


[04-Jul-21 09:25 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I think the electorate will decide


[04-Jul-21 09:27 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@Deleted User Now many in the industry would say something like Back from the Dead or some other more recent album where we really refined his style


[04-Jul-21 09:27 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But I'm going to go straight to the point and say that it is without a doubt Finally Rich


[04-Jul-21 09:27 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Now Finally Rich has some filler in the album, has some odd tracks like Laughing to the Bank which are fairly odd upon a first listen for example


[04-Jul-21 09:27 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But Finally Rich has aged supremely well and in terms of its influence on not only Chief Keef but also the entire subgenre of Trap music


[04-Jul-21 09:28 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It is probably the single most influential record in terms of defining the style which others would fall into


[04-Jul-21 09:28 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's not Man on the Moon in terms of creating the subgenre but it is really the most influential work of recent memory in terms of how it shaped modern music besides, say, Drake's earliest albums


[04-Jul-21 09:30 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Ultimately I have to conclude that the bitches, do in fact, love Sosa


[04-Jul-21 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Speaking of which - what are your thoughts on the latest Cudi album, Man on the Moon 3?


[04-Jul-21 09:32 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@Deleted User I'm again going to break from a lot of the mold when it comes to reviewing these kinds of works and would actually rate this as the ultimate refinement of Kid Cudi's talents


[04-Jul-21 09:32 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
He didn't do anything experimental and it wasn't game-changing like Man on the Moon


[04-Jul-21 09:32 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
or influential in the non-hip hop world like Man on the Moon 2


[04-Jul-21 09:32 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But Kid Cudi showed he still had it and was still capable of putting out solid tracks in his characteristic style


[04-Jul-21 09:33 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's not standout, it's going nowhere near a top 10 list of albums for sure like Finally Rich would


[04-Jul-21 09:33 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But it is perfectly amenable and admirable for what it does manage to achieve in terms of sound, production, lyrical content and all that


[04-Jul-21 09:33 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'd say that the album art is the best Kid Cudi album art though


[04-Jul-21 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I strongly agree with the statement about the album art


[04-Jul-21 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's very pretty

[04-Jul-21 09:37 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Wow the Prime Minister is here


[04-Jul-21 09:37 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@mikiboss What's your favourite Kanye album, Mr Prime Minister


[04-Jul-21 09:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Fun fact: Beautiful Trip is the shortest song to ever chart in *Billboard* history


[04-Jul-21 09:38 PM] mikiboss#2416
Perhaps a contentious pick, but i’ve always had a soft spot for Graduation


[04-Jul-21 09:38 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Wow that is very interesting actually!


[04-Jul-21 09:38 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Ah very interesting choice there, very revealing!


[04-Jul-21 09:39 PM] mikiboss#2416
It just has a degree of consistency that really keeps it going through the whole LP


[04-Jul-21 09:39 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
In fact Prime Minister since Clancy Oliver appears to have fallen asleep mid-interview, let's talk about Kanye for a bit

{Reactions}
🙏 (2) 😌 

[04-Jul-21 09:39 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@mikiboss Yeah I can agree but I don't really agree that the heights of Graduation really warrant it being the best album


[04-Jul-21 09:39 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and the two notable speed-bumps on the album really take you out of it


[04-Jul-21 09:39 PM] mikiboss#2416
That’s perfectly fair


[04-Jul-21 09:40 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and it's not like Ready to Die, another really good album which has speedbumps in tone, since the speedbumps aren't even that good


[04-Jul-21 09:40 PM] mikiboss#2416
Yeah there are some disjoining moments I do agree, but what is a real Kanye album without those moments


[04-Jul-21 09:40 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
True


[04-Jul-21 09:40 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Honestly Stronger for example is ruined for me since I was exposed to the Daft Punk Song before the Kanye song


[04-Jul-21 09:41 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and so I find it literally unlistenable because of that


[04-Jul-21 09:41 PM] mikiboss#2416
Ah very interesting. For me I think it was an exposure to both relatively similar periods due to cultural osmosis. Perhaps that is why it sticks for me so well


[04-Jul-21 09:41 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Fair enough, Prime Minister


[04-Jul-21 09:42 PM] mikiboss#2416
But I can see how someone in your position would find it unpalatable


[04-Jul-21 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh my god me too


[04-Jul-21 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
re: that thing about Stronger


[04-Jul-21 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
just pointing that out


[04-Jul-21 09:42 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
My personal favourite album is The College Dropout which for me, narrowly beats out My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy


[04-Jul-21 09:42 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The highs of The College Dropout are high and the speedbumps on that album are all servicable


[04-Jul-21 09:42 PM] mikiboss#2416
College Dropout is a very, VERY close second


[04-Jul-21 09:42 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I have a bit of a bias for early works done by artists as you can tell


[04-Jul-21 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Counterpoint: The College Dropout does not have Nicki Minaj


[04-Jul-21 09:43 PM] mikiboss#2416
Even as a project where it doesn’t hit, It works because you can see where Kanye has changed


[04-Jul-21 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
My personal favourite, as you can probably presume, is My Beautiful Dark Twisted fantasy


[04-Jul-21 09:43 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Through the Wire is also crazy inspirational as well


[04-Jul-21 09:43 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I use it to get hyped up before I have to do any task I don't wanna do


[04-Jul-21 09:44 PM] mikiboss#2416
Especially the first recording of it if you give that a listen


[04-Jul-21 09:44 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Oh yeah absolutely


[04-Jul-21 09:44 PM] mikiboss#2416
Hearing him try with those injuries and having it still flow is just what made Kanye the man he is today


[04-Jul-21 09:44 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Exactly, absolutely iconic


[04-Jul-21 09:44 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Then there's Family Business as well obviously


[04-Jul-21 09:45 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Jesus Walks literally works so well with the album art and I don't know why that vibes so much with me


[04-Jul-21 09:46 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
When he says "Cause the devils trying to break me down" and goes for a more emphasized word on the down really matches with the album arts posture and stance and I don't know why but that started my love for the album


[04-Jul-21 09:46 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The breathing in part always stresses me tf out though


[04-Jul-21 09:46 PM] mikiboss#2416
I can really see it. While it hasn’t stuck with me as much as a track, the breathing part does stick out as a golden moment on that whole project


[04-Jul-21 09:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
My overall ranking in regards to Kanye is 

1: The College Dropout
2: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
3: Late Registration
4: Yeezus
5: Kids See Ghosts
6: Graduation
7: The Life of Pablo
8: Watch the Throne
9: Ye
10: Jesus is King


[04-Jul-21 09:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'll admit Ye is artifically low because I just don't listen to it often


[04-Jul-21 09:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Life of Pablo is also artificially elevated


[04-Jul-21 09:50 PM] mikiboss#2416
I think that’s a tad harsh on Ye, but yeah I must agree with Jesus is king there


[04-Jul-21 09:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Due to the album art and it being my favourite


[04-Jul-21 09:51 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm gonna quickly switch Watch the Throne and Graduation tbh

{Reactions}

[04-Jul-21 09:51 PM] mikiboss#2416
Saleh is an excellent project from that, and will age well, other tracks just feel so dated already is only like 2 years


[04-Jul-21 09:52 PM] mikiboss#2416
I respect Kanye for going the mile, but it’s a shame the project as a whole just didn’t seem too cohesive


[04-Jul-21 09:52 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Jesus is King isn't even that bad of an album and I'm a big fan of spiritual music, hence why one of my favourites of all time is Killah Priest


[04-Jul-21 09:52 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But in terms of Kanye I think there's simply just better


[04-Jul-21 09:52 PM] mikiboss#2416
Yeah I think I’m just being harsh because of the competition


[04-Jul-21 09:53 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
There's a reason it is the most debated topic of all time


[04-Jul-21 09:53 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Anyway I feel the need to elaborate why I like The Life of Pablo art so much that it is my favourite art cover of all time


[04-Jul-21 09:53 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Well in terms of Kanye of course


[04-Jul-21 09:53 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Not in all of music lol that's taken by Liquid Swords


[04-Jul-21 09:54 PM] mikiboss#2416
I do like Pablo quite a bit. I just think I’ll grow on it a bit more in time


[04-Jul-21 09:54 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
For reference

Sudan: The transitional government has decided to hand over Ex-Sudanese president Omar Al Bashir (*) to the International Court of Justice where he will be judge for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.


[04-Jul-21 09:54 PM] mikiboss#2416
Sudanese Kanye


[04-Jul-21 09:55 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So the reason why I like this so much is because it has probably the most identifiable meaning from the get-go and is a deep and profound message ultimately which ties into Ye as a person


[04-Jul-21 09:55 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The album art tells a story instantly more than any other Kanye art so to speak


[04-Jul-21 09:56 PM] mikiboss#2416
Yeah I think for me when I listened to Pablo when it came out, I identified more as viewing in in a vacuum and not as a Ye drop. Perhaps on the re-listen that’ll change


[04-Jul-21 09:56 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The story is the choice between the titular Saint Pablo where he either chooses a happy wedding and a strong, stable black family in a world which is opposed to that concept where he would also give up everything he is and "westernize" so to speak as shown by him conforming to his suit and tie


[04-Jul-21 09:56 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
or the lifestyle which Kanye and Saint Pablo both wish to chase, the lifestyle of vice and beautiful women


[04-Jul-21 09:57 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Which is capped with the album art stating as a plain fact "which/one" which ultimately becomes Saint Pablo's choice


[04-Jul-21 09:57 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and therefore Kanye's choice as well


[04-Jul-21 09:57 PM] mikiboss#2416
That internal conflict between success and perceived greatness and one of borderline sin


[04-Jul-21 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
sim


[04-Jul-21 09:57 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Since Saint Pablo and Kanye become one and the same, intertwined


[04-Jul-21 09:58 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
That's a great way to put it. Success in the sense of family and creating a quiet, non-identified living or success in living the kind of lifestyle which they crave on the inside


[04-Jul-21 09:58 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I know @jüri_ratas_shill has very different opinions on this exact topic and I've tired to convert him over on this point


[04-Jul-21 09:58 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But yeah it's just my two cents in regards to Kanye's album art because I'm a big fan of discussing and talking about album art


[04-Jul-21 09:59 PM] mikiboss#2416
I think that’s been a rather fantastic chat


[04-Jul-21 09:59 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Since the very best album art are all paintings which either the music provides a backing track for or add a clear visual image and supplement the music as a whole


[04-Jul-21 10:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Anyway I shan't occupy Crikey for too long on this topic


[04-Jul-21 10:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@inactive Do you wish to continue the previous discussion about the by-elections, the Government minority and all that

Good evening! It’s been a while but Crikey is finally back.


[03-Jul-22 07:36 PM] inactive#6974
Today, we are looking at the results of the recent June 2022 Election, in our new series “Post Election Clarity”, which can be summed up in the following image.

[03-Jul-22 07:38 PM] inactive#6974
“We went in expecting to win nothing, and so we won everything”. The jubilant words of TheSensibleCentre, upon her upset of likely re-election as Prime Minister.


[03-Jul-22 07:38 PM] inactive#6974
The June 2022 Federal Election has brought an shock result as the Socialist Government now looks to have another term ahead of them, with a likely coalition partner in the Country Labor Party. This marks the first time that an incumbent Prime Minister has been re-elected since 2019, when Youmaton secured a second term as SDP Prime Minister - a feat that the Socialists are undoubtedly delighted with.


[03-Jul-22 07:39 PM] inactive#6974
The pre-campaign polls had the Commonwealth Party leading significantly and a decline in the Socialists first preference vote. The Liberal Nationals were on the rise and a centre right government seemed inevitable.


[03-Jul-22 07:40 PM] inactive#6974
However, on the night it was a different story. The key target seat of Denison, a CLP marginal was retained after How To Vote cards from both the Commonwealth and Liberal National parties preferenced against each other, so despite a combined right wing vote of 61%, incumbent MP Inadorable cruised through to victory with a Two Party Preferred (TPP) of 55/45 against the LNP.


[03-Jul-22 07:42 PM] inactive#6974
A similar story in Hotham as this time LNP preferences pushed incumbent CLP MP, Commonwealth defector Frost_Walker2017 over the line, 53/47. 

The final nail in the coffin, the icing on the cake was when Melbourne slipped from the hands of the Commonwealth Party to the Socialists, buoyed by progressive independent preferences.


[03-Jul-22 07:44 PM] inactive#6974
What could have easily been a majority of 9 seats for the right wing turned into an 8-7 split away from them. 

The Senate did not bring any better results, as a left wing landslide left the Commonwealth Party clinging onto their singular senator with newly elected NickiMinajsLeftNut replacing Chi1213. The Socialists revelled in the election of model-putrid and TheSensibleCentre, their full senate ticket elected.


[03-Jul-22 07:45 PM] inactive#6974
The Commonwealth Party quickly blamed the Liberal Nationals, and later that night Griffo was replaced as LNP leader by riley8583. Griffo has now entered into the co-leader position of the party, which let’s be honest is a poorly masked demotion. The Socialists basked in their victory and relative silence has come from the Country Labor Party, who are the kingmakers in the upcoming parliament.


[03-Jul-22 07:47 PM] inactive#6974
Of course, the question of the night was how could the polling get this wrong? How did the Socialists win every single seat that they contested? What was the lapse in judgement that resulted in the CLP benefiting from preferences of the LNP and CPA? What is in store for the rest of the term? Crikey plans to answer these burning questions in a series of articles. Soon to be released, an analysis of the Socialists results, the factors behind it and the consequences! Thanks for watching this brief broadcast, stay tuned!
