This Friday Direct Action will be drawing your attention to a very important issue for the Australian working class - the price of a Pint. It is criminal that in an advanced capitalist country like Australia that a Pint usually costs 10 dollars. That is why the @deleted-role will work with all parties in parliament to abolish alcohol taxes, and make sure that Australian workers can enjoy a brew after a hard day's work.

Hello everyone. Its Bsharri, MP from the @deleted-role and your host for tonight's late night election special. Tonight I will be looking at the Brisbane by-election.


[06-Jan-18 12:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its gonna be a pretty shit election to be honest, with the race pretty much an incestous threeway between the centrist boring old @deleted-role , the stale dog-obsessed @deleted-role, and the fucking absolute nutjob lunatics over at the @deleted-role. But lets break it down anyway because we have nothing else to do on a Friday night and were all fucking drunk!

First off we have the obvious and most likely victors, the @deleted-role. While their candidate @delad has been mostly deathly silent during the election and they don't seem to be offering anymore much more than the status quo, the Democrats are doing **quite** well in the polls, leading the primary vote with a third of the electorate. A victory for them could be an important vote of confidence for the government of @Deleted User and his centrist, soft progressive government, which has seen the finalization of popular social reforms such as the Greyhound Ban.

Following the Democrats are the dreaded Liberals, fuck I mean @deleted-role. Its been a pretty insane few months for them, with their highly unpopular ***Absolute*** Abortion Ban failing to pass. Their candidate for Brisbane, ex-Chief Justice @Deleted User, is seemingly on the "left" of the party, unwilling to commit to a bunch of the more controversial and manifestly revolting positions expressed by the right-wing party in the past. This may have worked in his favour, with him being placed with 20 percent of the primary vote with clear chance of taking the seat.

Then we have the underdog @deleted-role. While one would have been mistaken in thinking that @showstealer1829's small electoral formation was a flash in the pan virtually indistinguishable from the Democrats, his vitriolic and frankly bizarre disdain for the Greyhound Ban and the Prime Minister has projected this new party into the big league. Their candidate, @Deleted User, with 20 percent of the primary vote, is somehow in with a serious chance of winning, especially in the event that Liberal preferences go his way.

All that said, the only real option in this election is @deleted-role candidate @Keira. As the only real anti-establishment candidate in the race, Keira has been the only person to offer any real alternative to the neoliberal consensus that has so far dominated the Brisbane by-election and Australian politics as a whole. While other candidates have ranted on about greyhounds, Keira has taken the Socialist Party message of an Australia ***For the Many, Not the Few*** to the Brisbane electorate. While it is a shame that she most likely has little chance of winning the by-election, that a significant chunk of people are planning to go out and vote Socialist tomorrow stands as a testament to her hard work and the growing influence of the left in national political life.

Good shit. So ive been meaning to ask you, what do you make of the other candidates in the race? @delad is kind of a nice fella who looks a bit like a particular Uruguayan Marxist guerilla, and @Deleted User is a bit polite, but I want to know your thoughts.


[06-Jan-18 12:45 AM] Keira#0001
I've no particular issue with @delad or @Deleted User -- though I'm concerned about their frankly weak politics, and seeming lack of care for the worker -- have the Democrats pushed *any* real pro-worker policies in their time in power? The name of the @deleted-role itself is enough cause for concern, as well -- focus on the nation is a general hallmark of reactionary & racist parties, such as Britain First in the UK. Are either of these candidates standing with a platform that is good for the people of Brisbane?

[06-Jan-18 12:48 AM] Keira#0001
However, @Deleted User is my primary concern in this election -- as we all know, the Liberty Party is founded on the principle that corporations matter more than people, and blatant hatred of all those that differ from themselves. Even in his time as Justice, Forza exuded a loathsome air of hatred for others, and has been known to make extremely reactionary remarks. His seemingly "soft" support of the @deleted-role is also cause for concern -- what real agenda does he have here? A dangerous extremist, who we need to avoid electing at all costs.

Indeed. With the centrists and crazies aside, what kind of politics are you bringing to this election?


[06-Jan-18 12:53 AM] Keira#0001
Well, Bsharri, aside from the @deleted-role's brilliant platform, I'll be making it a personal goal to push for a raise in inheritance tax. Is it truly fair that being lucky enough to be born into privilege is enough to make you for life? I'd rather see that money split among the less fortunate than have some banker's son become a millionaire. The vagina lottery is by no means earning money -- it's contrary to the Australian  principles of giving everyone a fair go -- principles that only the @deleted-role actually support.

My exact thoughts. Sadly we dont have much time left @Keira. It was great to have you on. Perhaps you could finish off with a final statement to the people of Brisbane going out to vote later today?


[06-Jan-18 12:57 AM] Keira#0001
Sure, thanks for having me on.

My message to the people of Brisbane -- our program of radical change is the *only* one that has the capability to truly make a difference to you. Rather than sitting around while in power, the Socialist Party is committed to change and bettering the lives of ordinary, working Australians. Even if you don't believe in our radical program of change, I encourage you to #PutLibertyLast and oppose their extremist views. Preference the @deleted-role -- for the many, not the few.

Well we ended up being right about the Brisbane by-election. @Deleted User is in, the Liberty Party is out. For all our differences with the Australia Party, this result is a welcome blow to establishment politics. In honour of that we are going to play a classic tune that I think captures the spirit of the times as we head towards what is set to be a historic federal election: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7qQ6_RV4VQ

Well folks, I just got out of @Deleted User's budget speech. It was overall pretty tame, but the raising of the tax free threshold to 20,000 dollars is a welcome move which will see more money going into the (hip?) pockets of Australian workers. The removal of tax exemption for religious institutions is also a positive step and a blow to the Christian right who obsess around the issue. That said, the budget fails to go after the millionaires and oligarchs, who will continue to hoard their wealth in offshore bank accounts and receive massive corporate welfare from our government into the foreseeable future. Only a good showing for the Socialists in the next election will see  our vision of an Australia ***For the Many, Not the Few*** implemented via parliament.

[16-Jan-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Today we will be starting a new section of Direct Action, called Bolshevik Bible Circle, or BBC, where we look at the Bible and glean its wisdom and continuing relevance for socialists today.


[16-Jan-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Other holy books may be considered for readings in the future.

First off, we will be looking at a section from the Book of James.


[16-Jan-18 03:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Please turn to Chapter 5 of the Book of James in your respective bibles.


[16-Jan-18 03:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will read out this section in full. I will be using the New International Version Protestant Bible, not because I am a Protestant, but because I'm currently broadcasting from a motel in Northern Queensland.

It is with much pride that I would like to announce that the Socialist Party is now the largest political party in the country in terms of membership, slightly outnumbering (for now) the dastardly right-wingers over in the Liberty Party. I would like to thank the members for this huge victory. It is through our positive left-wing politics, our struggle to create an Australia ***FOR THE MANY, NOT THE FEW***, that we have brought so many people of all walks of life to this great party.

*Come and listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge, says he
"Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll surely hang, " says he
"And after that, Jim Jones
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones"*

*And our ship was high upon the sea
When pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin' round us
And the winds a-blowin' gale
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales
There's no time for mischief there they say
Remember that, says they
Or they'll flog the poaching out of you
Down there in Botany Bay*

*Now it's day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains
Into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bravest rankers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
**I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the flogger down
Oh, I'll give the land a little shock
Remember what I say
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay***

Bellman..?


[24-Jan-18 09:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
First of all, because I don't get invited to parties... everyone streaming this interview press f to pay respects... second of all, the hat is a gimmick for the public eye. I wouldn't invite the press to such parties. Also, if there were hookers and blow at the afterparty, I would not have gone anyway. It's well known, and you would know this, I'm a deeply religious man. I don't engage in or condone prostitution and coke. I mean, I don't even do fornication or porn, and I don't even smoke! Of course, I don't care what others do in their spare time... I think both you and I would like to see recreational substances such as cocaine legalised, and I'd be interested in looking into legalising prostitution as I'm sure you also would. Grown adults can do as they please. But I do very much believe in individual rights, in particular religious rights. So I stand by my religious values and don't engage in such things.


[24-Jan-18 09:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

Ah, you'll see he said at the COnvention


[24-Jan-18 09:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I was at the Convention


[24-Jan-18 09:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
and MrU was highly intoxicated


[24-Jan-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
So what is it Bellman, did the event not happen at all? Did it happen but you didn't attend? Did it happen and you attended but didn't partake?


[24-Jan-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
What was it Bellman?


[24-Jan-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Are you saying now that MrU has lied in his apology?


[24-Jan-18 09:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The first two are the most likely


[24-Jan-18 09:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
No, I am not...


[24-Jan-18 09:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm sure he is sorry for his behaviour at the Convention


[24-Jan-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
So he took cocaine at the convention?


[24-Jan-18 09:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I'm not 100% certain what that is, I mean, I heard some grunting noises from the coat room towards the end of it but...


[24-Jan-18 09:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I wouldn't know


[24-Jan-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well even if you did not partake in any kind of illegal activity, MrU has. Will action be taken to address this?


[24-Jan-18 09:08 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I mean, I can't confirm or deny that he has, you'd have to ask him


[24-Jan-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is not the first time that he has been in the public spotlight, and not in a good way.


[24-Jan-18 09:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well he admitted to it Bellman.


[24-Jan-18 09:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Action has already been taken, expect a statement from his offices in the near future


[24-Jan-18 09:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Of course, if a conviction is made, more serious action will need to be taken


[24-Jan-18 09:09 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But, until then...


[24-Jan-18 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
So we won't be seeing any internal process within the Liberty Party to investigate wether this afterparty took place or not?


[24-Jan-18 09:10 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The party is very good at not letting me know about what happens at afterparties. Or if they happen at all, apparently... 😢

Good to know. If it is found that the party did take place, and that illegal drugs and prostitutes were part of it, then what will you do, as Party leader?


[24-Jan-18 09:13 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
*thinks awhile* Is "sweep the whole thing under the rug" an acceptable response?


[24-Jan-18 09:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well in this case I don't think so Bellman. This has been the culmination of a series of scandals involving members of your party. Will you not take swift action to get rid of the bad eggs?

@BellmanTGM...


[24-Jan-18 09:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Oh, well... in that case...


[24-Jan-18 09:16 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well, if convictions are made then i will be forced to remove members


[24-Jan-18 09:17 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Otherwise, if their actions were lawful and twitter is just, as I suspect, exaggerated for the purposes of angering socialists which, by the way, he achieved quite successfully


[24-Jan-18 09:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I am just reporting the news Bellman. Final question — this whole scandal has involved allegations that Liberty has taken dodgy money from shady corporate donors. You recently admitted that you yourself take money from donors. Why should Australians vote for a party that is embroiled in constant scandals and serves the interests of the ultrarich?


[24-Jan-18 09:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I don't understand, how is accepting donations a scandal?


[24-Jan-18 09:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It's how political parties make money...


[24-Jan-18 09:21 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[24-Jan-18 09:23 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
And?


[24-Jan-18 09:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I assure you we have  donations from all walks of Australians

**BREAKING NEWS** The Leader of the @deleted-role has been shot in an attempt on his life by an ex-member turned Fascist known as "Bunkers", SS2002 or vantheman. The shooter was killed by police shortly after in which he commited suicide by cop. Many in the Socialist Party were worried for our leader's safety, but he is 100% fine as the bullet only grazed his arm. Bunkers was known to be apologetic to leaders such as Gaddafi and Pinochet, and was removed from the party for these views. We mourn the loss of life, and wished he had seen a better way. Bsharri will return to work tomorrow, ending on the statement of "No bullet wound can keep me out for long." We wish him well. More information may be found as the investigation continues.

The AEC has reported that the @deleted-role has taken the seats of Lingiari and Chisholm. While the count is far from over, the results now already represent a significant increase in the parliamentary power of the Socialists. In Lingiari, @Keira has been elected after unseating the incumbent Prime Minister, and @Deleted User has been elected in Chisholm in a historic landslide. Both women will bring the Socialists message of an Australia *For the Many , Not the Few*, to the lower house.

Hello everyone, time for my late night broadcast. This one will be short. As you will all know by now @Big Boy has been elected in Kingston, @Deleted User has been elected in Pearce, and me and @Deleted User have been elected to the Senate. This victory is not our own, but that of every activist, unionist, and campaigner who made all this possible and got our message out to the people. Tonight we could not be more proud to be members of the @deleted-role. Me, Lautaro, and Jooshr will be on the streets of Perth tonight with the huge crowds that have come out to celebrate this victory: https://youtu.be/kPb0Sm2iIX0

```Last night was complicated. Keira, after being serially harassed by others on the sim for the past few weeks, finally broke and went on what I can only describe as a drunken rampage. She left the party and pretended to be a Nazi for half an hour, complete with anti-semitic comments, swastikas, and all. Others like Maninjadog joined her in doing this in what I expect they considered was some kind of joke. While Keira's actions made sense considering the harassment she was subjected to, they were still not acceptable in the slightest. They greatly upset me and many others in the party and the sim, and made Keira's position in the party complete untenable. When she stopped pretending to be a Nazi and tried to rejoin, I said no, and told her that she was expelled. She then resigned from her position as an MP and left the sim. Kuresuta also randomly resigned his position without saying a word, and several other members just got up and left the sim. I suspect they left to avoid the drama resulting from this clusterfuck.```

```Needless to say, this has been a devastating blow to the Party and the hard work that several of us have put into it in the past 3 months. Many hours of hard work mobilizing our vote and coordinating our campaign work were poured into the last election. Several people who were entrusted with running for and taking parliamentary seats clearly did not give a shit about this work and were willing to throw it all away on a whim, even after we had become the biggest party in parliament and were on track to possibly form government. Realizing that the party as it stood was essentially broken, I asked for it to be dissolved by the judiciary. Since talking to remaining MP's @Jooshr and @Khaver, we have decided to try to salvage what remains of the party and make an effort to continue on as the only real left-wing group on the sim and in parliament. We will be reforming the Socialist Party, albeit on a much smaller basis. Lastly I would like to sincerely apologize to everyone for what has happened and hope we can all move forward.```

So Madama, I wanted to ask you about some of contenders for PM, get your thoughts on them.


[13-Apr-18 07:12 PM] m_l#8208
Governance and power are of secondary importance at this stage of the campaign. Being composed of such strong and dedicated personalities, we are confident in every rank from grassroots to leadership. At every level we are committed to *representation*. It has been argued that at some junctures progressive principles and the peoples' choice have been at odds. At Labor we listen, and we innovate. I think our choice in partners whether in leadership or in opposition will reflect that.


[13-Apr-18 07:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats interesting. What do you think about @PineappleCrusher_? Would he make a good PM?


[13-Apr-18 07:17 PM] m_l#8208
In my experience, a prime minister is only part of the equation. Perhaps if Pineapple was at the head of a Labor ministry and government, he could rise to the leadership. But fundamentally, the principles espoused by the Liberal Party are detrimental to the future of this great nation. No one person could change that. They've run a tired campaign. Jobs, growth, security. Has it ever changed? The achievement of those aims can be brought about in many disparate ways, but the Liberals have no plan, and whether he likes it or not, PineappleCrusher is the face of such an organisation.


[13-Apr-18 07:18 PM] m_l#8208
Change in itself is not meritious. It would appear that everyone wants prosperity for Australia. The only issue is, the Liberal Party is not equipped to drive the change they claim to endorse.

[13-Apr-18 07:22 PM] m_l#8208
I've had the pleasure of working with the CA and Deladi0. I think our approach to governance and responsibility are quite similar. However, it's high time we stop delivering targets which are not reflective of a changing population. What matters to most Australians, young and old, is what should drive the nation's policies. A national conversation is fundamental to the democracy Labor invisions. Benefits for all, harm to none. Efficiency, harmony. Sustainability met with progress. Unlike the CA, Labor would not overrule the Vox Populi on matters of industry and of a national identity.


[13-Apr-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats interesting. And lastly, I wanted to ask about your own Party. If the ALP were to win the election, who would you want to see become Prime Minister? @Harold or @Hoog?

We are bold, I'll give you that, but not so bold as to have a Prime Minister from the senate— so we'll see. It does not look like Labor will be forming a government of ourselves, and that of course requires the consideration of our bedfellows, unlikely or otherwise.

[13-Apr-18 07:32 PM] m_l#8208
Essentially I'm a liberal— small L. If the people decide to vote Pirate, I truly hope that the PP represent their best interests and do not sacrifice their integrity for power. Truly, I can see the Pirate Party influencing positive outcomes for Australia from either the position of providing supply, or as being part of a coalition. We do not need an exact overlap of ideas to have harmony in our co-operation. They have some innovative positions, and we hope to be able to work with them regardless of outcome.

So, what do you think are the main issues confronting us in this election?


[13-Apr-18 07:40 PM] m_l#8208
Overwhelmingly we see a skew towards economic health being a key concern in our population. Traditionally, that has come at a conflict with spending— on health, education, and infrastructure. This presents the perfect platform for Labor positions to perform. The time for an economics of transition from a rocky, post-crisis climate is up. At Labor, we plan on investing our resources and our money on policies which foster community and success. We understand that cold, hard growth is not the only indicator of economic health, and we seek to reimagine dying sectors of our economy into uniquely Australian and truly globally competitive industry. I think it's high time we pay attention to the standards of living of all Australians, irrespective of the way they vote. We do not want to restrict a secure, comfortable future for all Australians to the realm of imagination. At Labor we will work to make it part of reality. The rest of the world can follow.

I'd like to welcome @LuSing My Religion to the direct action studio. How is it going?


[24-Apr-18 03:32 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
It's going great Liam, now that we've actually got a government.


[24-Apr-18 03:33 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
So, what are your thoughts on the cabinet so far?


[24-Apr-18 03:35 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well, so far there's not a lot that's public about the cabinet make-up. Obviously I'm very happy with the PM. Also exciting to see my future Co-Queen Sprinkles in there as the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, which I'm sure she'll do a fantastic job at. And of course, let's not forget Hoog, who brings a solid record on worker's rights to the Deputy PM slot.


[24-Apr-18 03:35 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now, in terms of what's still private, let me say the cabinet looks *tremendous.* That's all I can really say.

Fair enough. What do you have in store for the people of Pearce? And, do you have any ideas for bills you want to pass?


[24-Apr-18 03:40 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
When I was on the campaign trail, I had so many people come up to me from these rural and regional communities to tell me about drugs, particularly ice, and what it's doing to their communities. So you can bet that I'll be working closely with the relevant ministers to proper rehab centres built all across Australia. And I'm going to be in the Socialist Party room pushing for drug decriminalisation. We should follow Portugal's courageous example and stop stuffing our prisons with people who are, in most respects, victims.


[24-Apr-18 03:41 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And, given how big the electorate is, better transport is a must. I'm hoping a Socialist Government will be one that makes busses more frequent, makes trains more frequent, and brings *public* transport across Australia back into *public* hands.


[24-Apr-18 03:49 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Good to hear. Thats all the questions I have today, do you have anything you want to say to Australia?


[24-Apr-18 03:49 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Just something very simple. Let's get to work. We've waited two weeks for this government, we'd best get to it without delay.


[24-Apr-18 03:51 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Good to hear. A last thing from me, if anyone would like to come onto direct action, please contact me. If you want to talk about policy or even just have a chat, I'll fit you in. Good afternoon Australia. Now, we return to "A tribute to Pete Seeger."

The official statement released by the coalition was;
"Fellow Australians,

After a long period of negotiations, the Pirate Party, Socialist Party, and Labor Party have united to form a coalition majority government under Prime Minister Bsharri.  We aim to continue the many successes of the NotKhrushchevsGhost government, while bringing to life a new, innovative vision for Australia. Our commitment to delivering real and substantial change on the issues affecting ordinary Australians is as strong as ever. 

We will work to ensure healthcare and education as a right for all Australians, regardless of wealth or class. We will continue to deliver a progressive social agenda which fights for a fairer, more equal society. We will bring Australia into the 21st century by working towards a Republic, so we can choose a head of state who is one of our own. We will change the rules so that power is put back into the hands of Australian workers and not greedy economic elites.  We will work to craft a treaty with Indigenous Australians, ensuring their right to their land and a better future. We will defend, sustain, and manage the environment as a birthright for all who live in this country.

Australia, these are our promises. Together, we will build an Australia, for the many, not the few. "

I really glad to have been given the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructure!


[24-Apr-18 07:41 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I mean obviously we have all had our eyes on other ministries but I'm still very, very honored to be Minister for Industry and Infrastructure.


[24-Apr-18 07:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Got exactly what i wanted
I'm well acquainted with Australian defence capibilities and was practically raised on white papers so Im thrilled to be defense minister. I'm looking forward to doing everything I can to not only improve our security but also working to improve the lives of veterans in terms of mental health and financial wellbeing. It's the least we can do to help these people who are willing to lay down their lives for us and the security of this nation.


[24-Apr-18 07:42 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I look forward to your work.


[24-Apr-18 07:44 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
*Nods* So am I. Good to hear from both of you. You've both got quite the heavy workload coming from the looks, I'm sure you're up for it. But anyway, care to comment one the placement of other Socialist party members? Liam getting Labour and DKM getting LGBTQI+ and such?


[24-Apr-18 07:46 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the cabinet placements were decided with a combination of who wanted what, and how qualified they were, so i think everyone is not only satisifed but qualified for the role, especially the 2 examples you gave.


[24-Apr-18 07:49 PM] High Priest Liam#6655

DKM is a highly respected LGBT advocate and I look forward to working with her to bring LGBTQIA+ issues into the public view! As for Liam as minister for Labour, I am very, very proud to hear this! Liam is a hard working representative who has always looked out for the rights of working class Australians and I look forward to all his work in his new position.

*nods* Busy schedule.


[27-Apr-18 09:50 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I don't have side projects, government has taken up a lot of time. I've been mostly focused on consulting with the community of Pearce, and very soon I'll be touring the country and meeting with representatives of the GSM community to talk about what they want to see, what bills they feel need to be passed. It's important to understand their experiences if we want parliament to work for this group that has been historically denied even the most basic of rights.


[27-Apr-18 09:50 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Obviously, before anybody starts on about this, I know that a previous government passed Same-Sex Marriage and I'm glad they did.


[27-Apr-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then why is a LGBT department actually necessary?


[27-Apr-18 09:52 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Because there's still work to be done, obviously.

Is it not just more government bureaucracy and spending?


[27-Apr-18 09:52 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The thought that being able to marry is the be all and end all is a real blindspot in public discourse.


[27-Apr-18 09:53 PM] Deleted User#0000

[27-Apr-18 09:53 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Now now you two. I like to keep direct action chill.


[27-Apr-18 09:53 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Just a quick example, transpeople are far more likely to be murdered than the general population. They're far more likely to take their own lives and the government must take measures to stop that.


[27-Apr-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Of course


[27-Apr-18 09:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
But what would a LGBT Affairs department do?


[27-Apr-18 09:55 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I've not even gotten moved into my apartment yet, I'll have to get back to you on the contents of actual bills once the department begins to draft them.

[27-Apr-18 10:07 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Not really. Everything has a distinct purpose. We all feel pretty happy with the cabinet as far as I can tell. We each have a distinct focus and we won't be spread thin by covering lots of topics.


[27-Apr-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000

[27-Apr-18 10:11 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I'd ask you to reserve judgement on if the cabinet is too large until after bills start being introduced to parliament.

[29-Apr-18 07:31 PM] m_l#8208
But there's progress being made in the health sector for sure


[29-Apr-18 07:33 PM] m_l#8208
We've got proposals lined up for the protection of gender and sexual minorities, such as a bill really cracking down on conversion therapy, and one pushing for the protection of the healthcare rights of intersex people.


[29-Apr-18 07:34 PM] m_l#8208
On top of this, we've discussed implementing greater cover for mental illness— and health— through medicare, and I look forward to working as a team to put that together.


[29-Apr-18 07:35 PM] m_l#8208
I've only recently been given the treasury and finance portfolio, so right now I'm just trying to be a part of a smooth transition of roles.


[29-Apr-18 07:36 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Fair enough. Speaking on finance, is the government confident in spending and income?


[29-Apr-18 07:39 PM] m_l#8208
I would say so. We have good discussions about how to finance measures when they are proposed, and every one of our members has insights on how best to manage inflows with outflows for given proposals.


[29-Apr-18 07:40 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Good to hear. Since its part of every interview that's happened recently, I thought i'd follow the trend. Do you think the Government is "STABLE"? *shivers after he says it*


[29-Apr-18 07:42 PM] m_l#8208
Government? Absolutely


[29-Apr-18 07:42 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Care to elaborate?


[29-Apr-18 07:42 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
*sighs at himself*

[29-Apr-18 07:52 PM] m_l#8208
What was your biggest hesitation in forming coalition with the PP and the ALP, personal or otherwise, and has that been alleviated in the time we've had working together?

[29-Apr-18 07:54 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Good question.


[29-Apr-18 07:56 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Its well know I'm one of the Socialist parties further left members, so working with the ALP was quite out of my comfort zone. They're quite close to the center compared to myself. With the Pirate Party, there wasn't much hesitation. But Labor did make me take a moment. After working with you all though, I can say my fears had no base. You're respectful and open to new ideas. And I can say I was more open than I thought I would be. So, yes and yes in short.


[29-Apr-18 07:57 PM] m_l#8208
I'm happy to hear that!


[29-Apr-18 07:57 PM] m_l#8208
Thanks for having me on.


[29-Apr-18 07:58 PM] m_l#8208

As you should on May Day. Been busy with speeches and appearances today?

Yes, have been travelling around a fair bit. Anything to keep me away from Canberra.


[01-May-18 07:38 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Haha, true enough. May Day is a special day for the socialist party, and I'd like for you to have the honor of explaining why to those who are new to our movement.


[01-May-18 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well May Day has a long tradition


[01-May-18 07:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
But it has always been celebrated by the socialist movement as the day of the international working class.


[01-May-18 07:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
The day when we celebrate our many victories - the 8 hour day, the minimum wage.


[01-May-18 07:43 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Indeed.


[01-May-18 07:43 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
May Day has been nicknamed "Union Christmas" for a reason. *Laughs*


[01-May-18 07:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, a great day for our movement.


[01-May-18 07:45 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Hell, its a great day for MOST leftist movements.


[01-May-18 07:46 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
I'd even call all of May a great month for the worker. Labour Day is this month too.


[01-May-18 07:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, and its also a reminder of what we have yet to accomplish. I for one think that this May Day should be a rallying cry for workers to go back to their workplaces and demand better wages and conditions, even go on strike if need be.


[01-May-18 07:49 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Absolutely. My personal motto is "Never Settle". Keep pushing to the next goal. The workers of Australia deserve better than what they get.


[01-May-18 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats a good motto.


[01-May-18 07:51 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
It also looks like May will be for more than just the worker, as the Human Rights Arts and Film Festival has announced they will be pushing for their expo to be in May every year.


[01-May-18 07:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats good news. Human rights are an important issue. Hopefully we can get an Australian Bill of Rights during this term.


[01-May-18 07:53 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Absolutely, if you want to head over to the HR Arts and Film Festival, check our website to support it and get yourself some tickets.


[01-May-18 07:54 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The next thing I'd like to discuss Bsharri is some more good news. Its seems all the MPs have settled into their roles quite well, can you explain your reasoning for putting people where they are?


[01-May-18 07:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ahh well it would take to long to go through every appointment.


[01-May-18 07:56 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Of course.


[01-May-18 07:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is worth saying that we do have a great cabinet, filled with people enthusiastic about reform and positive politics.


[01-May-18 07:57 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Absolutely. We're all working on a bills quite hard, thats for sure.


[01-May-18 07:58 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Last thing before our union song marathon, you know, Billy Brag, Utah Phillips, the good stuff... If you could say one thing to every worker in Australia, right at this moment, on this amazing day, what would it be?


[01-May-18 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
This a government of the people and for the people, and we will defend you in every way we can. We have stood for workers for a long time and are not backing down now. So go out there and agitate, resist, and strike. You have nothing to lose but your chains.


[01-May-18 08:00 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Powerful.


[01-May-18 08:02 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
And thats the end of our May Day interview special! I'd like to thank the Prime Minister for visiting us today, hope you approve with what I've done with the place! Anyway, like I said, its over to the union song marathon. Billy Bragg with "never cross the picket line" is up first. @LuSing My Religion May pop on to introduce a new program later tonight. Happy May Day Australia! And as always, SOLIDARITY!

[18-May-18 04:31 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Welcome back to Direct Action for a special report called *Convention Watch.* For this program, we'll be examining how the representatives of Australia are serving in their roles as delegates. Or how they’re not in some cases.


[18-May-18 04:31 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Let’s start with opening statements. Statements were made by General_Rommel (judiciary), dyljam (CA), Slothsworth (judiciary),Youmaton (Soc), Bsharri (Soc) and AMN (Soc). This means that hoogstra (ALP), Ash (Lib), Dicky_Knee (judiciary) and Kingethan (CA) all failed to make opening statements.


[18-May-18 04:32 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Somebody who was vocally pro-monarchy finally arrived at the vote for the Convention Schedule, when Ash voted. He was the only one however, with other votes being cast by Rommel, Bsharri, AMN, dyljam and hoogstra.


[18-May-18 04:32 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
When the time came for debate on whether the convention should support a republic, only Rommel, slothsworth, bsharri and dyljam spoke.


[18-May-18 04:32 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
At the subsequent vote, dyljam, bsharri, hoogstra, Dicky_Knee, Youmaton and Slothsworth all voted.


[18-May-18 04:32 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Currently the convention is debating a model, and only Ash, Slothsworth, and hoogstra have put forward any serious proposals, although Rommel did attend to support proposals. 

Remarkably we have not seen Kingethan once during the course of the convention, and Dicky_Knee has only attended to shout SHAME.


[18-May-18 04:33 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
All in all, perhaps a disappointing convention for those Australians who voted for monarchist candidates to support them, only to see very limited participation from their side.


[18-May-18 04:52 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Breaking, we've just had another speech, with Youmaton putting forward a presidential election model.


[18-May-18 04:53 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I believe we have a projection for a hypothetical presidential election

BREAKING NEWS! @Rat Is now a national executive of the socialist party, alongside Myself, @Youmaton, @LuSing My Religion, @Matt Monti and @ChairmanMeeseeks


[21-May-18 09:43 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
I'd like to announce the death of @Karzkin. He was a great man, a socialist support and mostly, one of my best friends. He died in a car accident, he was T boned at about 9:40pm today at an intersection in the City of Melbourne. He was pronounced dead at the scene. He wasn't the biggest supporter of the system, but he stuck it out for me as a friend, and I'd like to thank him for being there for the good times and the bad. I'm so sad you'll never be able to come to my wedding, and get hammered at my bachelor party. Solidarity Comrade..... Solidarity.

And your statement for Australia?


[21-May-18 10:49 PM] Youmaton#1190
My statement for Australia is that as leader of the party, I will strive to work for every single one of you. No matter who you are, I will work for Australians, and fight for the cause. The Socialist party is the party that will focus on progressing our society to a better tomorrow, where all are equal. This is our leadership team, we will be launching our campaign extremely soon, and we hope you can all join us in working to change this amazing country for the better!

My predecessor @High Priest Liam


[28-May-18 07:08 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Welcome Liam


[28-May-18 07:08 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Heyo


[28-May-18 07:09 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
How are you doing?


[28-May-18 07:09 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Good, its great to be back.


[28-May-18 07:09 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Thats good to hear


[28-May-18 07:09 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
well, Thank you for joining me. Jumping right in, what spawned this desire to break away from the Socialists and form the Viking’s? Was there a particular thing? Or was it simply a gut feeling?


[28-May-18 07:10 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Well, it was mostly gut. Something told me it was time to break away. As I said, there was no bad blood or hard feelings.


[28-May-18 07:11 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Well thats good to hear


[28-May-18 07:11 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
So, Now that you’ve formed an entire brand new political party, perhaps you’d like to tell the sim what you stand for, what the base is and what you’ll do if elected?


[28-May-18 07:12 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Actually, we've just finished writing our manifesto. Do you mind if I plug that you direct action?


[28-May-18 07:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
No, thats fine

Viking Party of Australia Manifesto
Viking Party of AustraliaOur Manifesto The Viking Party is a left-libertarian leaning group of people devoted to individual and social freedom. We have a keen interest in alternative religions and freedom of religion, with a right to worship whoever you wish. Our outlook is...

[28-May-18 07:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
well after a quick peruse it seems to look pretty good


[28-May-18 07:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
But a little more on policy, what about defence?


[28-May-18 07:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
You seem to have ruled out the ANZUS, why is that?


[28-May-18 07:15 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Yes, I haven't strayed too far from my Socialist values. Many Vikings members are ex-socialists, so we're bound to have some cross over.


[28-May-18 07:16 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
of course, its a proud policy of ours, but for the benefit of the sim, whats the reasoning behind this? You briefly touch on getting dragged into foreign wars, could you elaborate?

Sorry I'm late everybody, I was not informed the interview was now


[28-May-18 07:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Hello DKR


[28-May-18 07:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Apologies


[28-May-18 07:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
we couldnt reach you


[28-May-18 07:18 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Hey DKR.


[28-May-18 07:19 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
But on the question, I have very similar reasons to the Socialist Party personally. But all my members agreed that throwing lives  away in wars America likes to wage is silly in my opinion. For party policy as a whole, its about throwing lives away, but you'd have to ask the members for their personal reasons.


[28-May-18 07:20 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Your party policies are self-described “Libertarian Socialist”, what does that look like? What would be an example of policy of yours that sort of exemplifies this?


[28-May-18 07:21 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Loosening the grip of the government in every day life, while keeping people supported when they cannot do so themselves.


[28-May-18 07:21 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
What are your plans regarding the Socialist party? Or other parties? Are you open to coalition governments? Considering the lack of a senate foothold, I imagine it would be difficult to form government without at least supply and confidence.


[28-May-18 07:22 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We're open to Coalitions, we're a young party and I'm not ashamed to say that we could benefit from a helping hand. As for parties I'd like to coalition with, we'll see closer to election day.


[28-May-18 07:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Okay, can you give us any details on where you are running people? Particular seats and names?


[28-May-18 07:23 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
I can confirm I am running in Bradfield. As for other seats, I'd rather not say.


[28-May-18 07:23 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
I will do so later, as I am trying to set up a media outlet for the Viking Party.


[28-May-18 07:23 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Interesting


[28-May-18 07:24 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now, just reading the manifesto, I notice a lot of these policies are also our policies


[28-May-18 07:24 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
(wew)


[28-May-18 07:24 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You know, ensuring a just transition to renewables, healthcare reform and drug decriminalisation, making university affordable, cracking down on tax loopholes.


[28-May-18 07:25 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So with all that considered could you talk a little bit more about the why of the Viking Party?


[28-May-18 07:25 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Not just why you split but also why you went with the name Viking Party?


[28-May-18 07:25 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
(I was actually pumped for the raids)


[28-May-18 07:27 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Leftist parties have similar views on things, the Pirate manifesto also has similar outlooks. As for the why? I felt as if the Socialist Party didn't really help out the Pagan crowed much. I didn't want the party to be forced to cater to my small religion, so I decided to create my own party.


[28-May-18 07:27 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well... interesting

*walks in and sits in the audience area alone*


[28-May-18 07:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
*waves*


[28-May-18 07:29 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I'm actually quite good friends with a Pagan in my area so I can understand where you're coming from. However, why would you decide to base your party's support on a miniscule and barely existent community rather than staying in the Socialist Party and introducing bills to protect the pagan community as private member's bills?


[28-May-18 07:30 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Although considering our commitment to individual rights the National Executive would almost certainly have approved any bill you wanted that protected this particular minority.


[28-May-18 07:30 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
I can say with confidence as a former hellenistic pagan i would have


[28-May-18 07:31 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Like I said, I felt like I didn't really want to force my religion down your throats. I felt my time with the Socialists had been fruitful, but it was time for me to forge my own path.


[28-May-18 07:31 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And your own path is the Viking Party?

So I just wanted to confirm you do indeed see prospects for a European Pagan party in 2018CE in the island nation of Australia which has no connection to the Norse religion

[28-May-18 07:34 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The Viking party is simply a name. I did not specify what type of paganism we endorse. Be cause it is all pagan religions.


[28-May-18 07:35 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Do you then hope to appeal to Aboriginal communities and their myriad of religious beliefs?


[28-May-18 07:35 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Absolutely.


[28-May-18 07:35 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Or Hindu's for that matter?


[28-May-18 07:35 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Absolutely.


[28-May-18 07:36 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Or those Māori people of Australia who believe in Rangi and Papa.


[28-May-18 07:36 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Or any alternative religion.


[28-May-18 07:36 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
As a Pagan Party do you consider Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikh and other non-Abrahamic religions to be pagan?


[28-May-18 07:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
(Sikh is mono and hindu we did)


[28-May-18 07:37 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
(i was using it as an example)


[28-May-18 07:37 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
(np, just making sure)


[28-May-18 07:37 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The question shouldn't be does the party, but do those people see themselves as Pagan.


[28-May-18 07:38 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
If the answer is yes, we will welcome them with open arms.


[28-May-18 07:38 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Even if the answer is no, we will do the same.


[28-May-18 07:38 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Who is the party to label these people?


[28-May-18 07:39 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We do not have the right to do that.


[28-May-18 07:39 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
But will you make a concentrated effort to appeal to the 1.9% of people in Australia who are Hindu?


[28-May-18 07:39 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
If our Hindu members wish it so, we will.


[28-May-18 07:40 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So do you have an electoral strategy or are you simply hoping a Hindu joins the party

{Reactions}
👵🏿 🔴 

[28-May-18 07:41 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We have an electoral strategy. Religion is not our only concern.


[28-May-18 07:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Now DKR, do you wish to move on or would you like to continue with this line?


[28-May-18 07:41 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
*whispering* I just don't understand why


[28-May-18 07:42 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Sure, let's move on, I'm sure you have other questions


[28-May-18 07:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Cause Im happy with either


[28-May-18 07:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
okay then


[28-May-18 07:42 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
You do realize you could have a personally contacted me. We are still friends. At least I hope we are.


[28-May-18 07:43 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Of course we are still friends and comrades


[28-May-18 07:44 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
We are not the ABC, we don't have to be objective so I'm just gonna say I truly think the creation of the Viking Party is one of modern Australia's silliest political developments but I still personally like you and aloshn.


[28-May-18 07:45 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Nameyxe too?


[28-May-18 07:46 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
(you didn't have to delete the question @ChairmanMeeseeks)


[28-May-18 07:46 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally and minimising job loss for fossil power plant workers?


[28-May-18 07:47 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Oh yeah nameyxe of course


[28-May-18 07:48 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I forgot due to the previously mentioned fever dream effect


[28-May-18 07:48 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
In the manifesto it states that we will push for incentives for creation of companies investing into renewables. We understand workers are at risk, so we need to make sure they're not left behind. As for a specific action, I only just rented this office building, I'm still moving in, for official actions and bills, it will take us a little while.


[28-May-18 07:48 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
A lot of people, particular CA but also many others have been demanding the next government do a budget. How high is this on your agenda?


[28-May-18 07:49 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Well, as high as having a budget is on everyone's agenda. We need to know where tax dollars are going. As an ex-member of the Socialist Party I can understand why we didn't get a budget out before the election was called, but it should be one of the number 1 things on the governments list of things-to-do.


[28-May-18 07:49 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Some have raised the question that given the prevention on legislation relating to religion in the constitution, what is the Viking party's plan if elected?


[28-May-18 07:50 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We're hoping to work with the government to find out ways to support the pagan communities of Australia.


[28-May-18 07:51 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
One concerned citizen asked "Why should I vote for Viking instead of the bigger party The Socialists?"


[28-May-18 07:53 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Because everyone loves an underdog? *chuckles* The thing is I can't answer that for you. Its up to you who you vote for. If you're a pagan, vote for us, if you're a libertarian socialist, vote for us, if you like what you see on our manifesto, vote for us.


[28-May-18 07:54 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Although that doesn't really help them does it? If they like what's on your manifesto, they will already like what's on our manifesto.


[28-May-18 07:54 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Given they are practically the same.


[28-May-18 07:54 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
So is the Pirates, yet people voted for them over the Socialist Party.


[28-May-18 07:55 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The Pirate Party collapsed into a smouldering heap, do you plan to emulate this as well as the vote splitting?


[28-May-18 07:55 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
After all the need to coordinate between three parties rather than two is one of the main reasons we didn't have a budget last term.


[28-May-18 07:56 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
I don't see how that applies to the Vikings?


[28-May-18 07:56 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
The Pirates are a different party, I was merely pointing out, that despite being similar in views to the Socialists, they got votes over the Socialists.


[28-May-18 07:56 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
It just seems like you wish to fill a hole left by the Pirates even though the Socialists already have


[28-May-18 07:57 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
well, you said you used pirates as an example and you've said you'd be happy to coalition


[28-May-18 07:57 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Yes I did. I did not say "We will be the new pirates".


[28-May-18 07:58 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Now, with the constitutional convention winding down, I’d like to ask your personal opinions on that subject. What should Australia look like? Should we be independent? Should we have used the Youmaton Constitution as opposed to the McGarvie model?


[28-May-18 07:59 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
As for the model, I had no preference. As for our independence, I 100% support it.


[28-May-18 07:59 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
If I can jump in


[28-May-18 07:59 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
of course


[28-May-18 07:59 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I assume the manifesto is merely a document setting out priorities, not the entirety of your legislative platform?


[28-May-18 08:00 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Yes.


[28-May-18 08:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Just to clarify for the viewers


[28-May-18 08:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
OK


[28-May-18 08:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
How does the party decide policy?


[28-May-18 08:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
What is the Viking process for that


[28-May-18 08:00 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
By Majority.


[28-May-18 08:01 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
who votes in that scenario?


[28-May-18 08:01 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
elected parliamentarians?


[28-May-18 08:01 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We're currently small, so all the members.


[28-May-18 08:01 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but in the future?


[28-May-18 08:01 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
We'll see how it adapts.


[28-May-18 08:01 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
what would you like to see?


[28-May-18 08:01 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Presumably you would create a party constitution for that purpose, yes?


[28-May-18 08:02 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Personally, I'd like everyone to have a say.


[28-May-18 08:02 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Every member should have the right to have their view heard and listened too.


[28-May-18 08:03 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well that's the way we do it here


[28-May-18 08:03 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So CM, do we have any more questions from the people?


[28-May-18 08:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
not so far


[28-May-18 08:04 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Shall we wrap up?


[28-May-18 08:04 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Perhaps we should

Oop


[01-Jun-18 06:31 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
its starting


[01-Jun-18 06:31 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
We know go live to the courtroom where history is being made


[01-Jun-18 06:33 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
So far the defendant has entered the chamber


[01-Jun-18 06:34 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The justice has complained about the "help around  here"


[01-Jun-18 06:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The justices BC and slothsworth are yet to enter, as is the complainant General Rommel


[01-Jun-18 08:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The case has commenced


[01-Jun-18 08:07 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The complainant has submitted the submission to the justices and Dicky has entered a plea of not guilty to a breach of the Code of conduct


[01-Jun-18 08:21 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
A lot of what we're seeing here is the early stages of a formal trial


[01-Jun-18 08:21 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
dicky is throwing barbs and dismissing rommels claim


[01-Jun-18 08:21 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but rommel seems to be focused purely on establishing his case


[01-Jun-18 08:23 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
meanwhile in the TobycoolvBsharri case, Bsharri in his defence has reffered to a 2016 precedent, which Rommel is saying does not apply under the code of conduct and therefore, unless the defendant can prove otherwise, isnt a valid precedent


[01-Jun-18 08:26 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The cases sighted?


[01-Jun-18 08:26 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Cat rose, patrick right and april holcombe


[01-Jun-18 08:26 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[01-Jun-18 08:26 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Coleman v Powers


[01-Jun-18 08:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Bsharri has also applied for an extension for the case


[01-Jun-18 08:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
But back onto Rommel v dicky


[01-Jun-18 08:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
BC has dismissed Dicky_Knee's assertion that the claim is "vexatious"


[01-Jun-18 09:14 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and in a surprising turn of events


[01-Jun-18 09:15 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the court is yet to approve this withdrawl

@LuSing My Religion Can you tell us anything about what you think this will mean for the next Parliament?


[03-Jun-18 12:07 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well, let's address the elephant in the room first


[03-Jun-18 12:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
This is a disappointing election


[03-Jun-18 12:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
10 seats that we knew the outcome of before the polls could even open


[03-Jun-18 12:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
It's a shame parties weren't able to field more candidates to fill these spots and actually give us a contest


[03-Jun-18 12:09 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
I couldnt agree more


[03-Jun-18 12:09 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
especially as someone in an uncontested electorate


[03-Jun-18 12:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So we've got people like woof, a ~~convicted homophobe~~ thoroughly unpleasant person, parachuted into parliament by virtue of having nobody else contesting


[03-Jun-18 12:10 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And while it does mean good parliamentarians like AMN are guaranteed a spot, I'd still prefer the Australian people get a voice


[03-Jun-18 12:10 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The majority of the country has been effectively disenfranchised


[03-Jun-18 12:12 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And the majority of these uncontested seats are Liberal, which means everybody else has a much larger hill to climb


[03-Jun-18 12:12 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So, very disappointing all round


[03-Jun-18 12:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

While I've bought, let's say an innovative style, to campaigning, Jenga has barely even campaigned at all.

Now, on one hand we have a parliamentarian with a long record of service returning to politics after some time off. And on the other hand, someone nobody has ever heard of before. I think phylli will pick up both the simulated vote and probably also the lone Labor voter, making him next MP for Batman

tbyrn21 vs TWF
Whitlam is perhaps the closest call of this election, how do you think it will go DKR?


[03-Jun-18 12:38 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well, two first preference votes for the Socialists looks good for TWF, but we can be pretty certain there's also two for the CA. It all comes down to Emperor-Azir who is a total unknown as far as I'm aware. That and the sim vote, which tbyrn looks set to win. Either a supp or CA, but I'll call :CA:

thoughts on the new parliament?


[03-Jun-18 12:46 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
unless labor, vikings and a CA or indy help, Socialists look pretty grim, as do Liberals


[03-Jun-18 12:46 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well, this projection I've made has the Liberals lose every single contest and be in a solid place to form government if they can win over the Independents and Centre Alliance which would be an absolute farce if it were to happen


[03-Jun-18 12:47 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Although a Socialist-Labor-Viking coalition is certainly possible, and I wouldn't be opposed to that as disappointing as our lack of socialist majority is.


[03-Jun-18 12:47 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
even then they dont have the numbers


[03-Jun-18 12:47 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
ca and both independents isnt 9


[03-Jun-18 12:48 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Yeah my mistake, I'm bad at reading


[03-Jun-18 12:49 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so
A very large inclusive coalition involving 3 parties and an indy under Socialists


[03-Jun-18 12:50 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
or 2 parties and and both indies under liberals


[03-Jun-18 12:50 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
those are our most likely options


[03-Jun-18 12:50 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Or I suppose parliament is dissolved and we all have another go at it


[03-Jun-18 12:53 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[03-Jun-18 02:11 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
firstly, congratulations on your election


[03-Jun-18 02:11 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now, there's been issue taken by some people with a recent speech given by candidate for Greenway, @Ash , specifically his pledge to strengthen worker protections. Could you elaborate on the Liberal Party's plan in regards to these laws?

{Reactions}
👎 🤢 liberal 🇸 🇺 🇨 🇰 5⃣ 

[03-Jun-18 02:15 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And is there any talk in the party room about bringing criminal charges against bosses who provide unsafe workplaces, which often leads to worker deaths?


[03-Jun-18 02:19 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Go right ahead


[03-Jun-18 02:24 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I suppose that segues nicely into this MWT you spoke about earlier. What would be the mechanics of such a taskforce?


[03-Jun-18 02:26 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Interesting, now there was something else in that speech that was interesting to me, and it was the pledge to merge the ABC and SBS. Given that the two stations offer largely different content and fill different needs, how does the Liberal Party see this as a way to boost efficiency.


[03-Jun-18 02:32 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now that is an interesting point, as the ABC doesn't feature commercial advertising, it only advertises other programs on the ABC, whereas the SBS does have those


[03-Jun-18 02:32 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
If you combined them, what would the rules for advertising be on this broadcaster?


[03-Jun-18 02:38 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Very uncontroversial answer there, but what are some big examples of corruption you see that make this a necessary campaign promise?


[03-Jun-18 02:40 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well yes I'm sure the Liberal Party knows a thing or two about corruption


[03-Jun-18 02:42 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Hopefully we can have you back some time for an elaboration


[03-Jun-18 02:42 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And that concludes our broadcast for now folks.

He has asked the judiciary to refer dicky over this afk status


[10-Jun-18 12:17 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
I am very very disappointed in this decision laid out by the judiciary. Clearly the justices didn't read their own judgements in determining what constitutes spam. I will be speaking with my counsel about an appeal very shortly. As for the High Court, we have seen the last two instances of their judgements being way out of line with community expectations. Precedent means nothing to them anymore. When I return I will be launching a serious review into the legal knowledge and ability of Justice's Chrome and Slothsworth. Thank you to my supporters, I will continue to stand against injustice.

It has come to the attention of the crew at Direct Action that some rather sketchy reporting has come from #today-tonight with regards to the disappearance of my dear husband Liam. Might I just say how Disgusted I am with the anchor of the program @Deleted User and how he would use my husbands disappearance as a way to up ratings and make jokes. How rude and insensitive do you have to be.


[25-Jun-18 08:07 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I hope that Liam will return to us soon and until such a time, I ask that Woof and the Crew of #today-tonight leave him be and let our family and I live in peace.

Utter fucking bullshit.


[25-Jun-18 08:19 PM] waltor#3519
Defamation and slander my arse, #today-tonight has been slandering people for a long time before.


[25-Jun-18 08:19 PM] waltor#3519
Embarassing this person is an MP and sad no party ran against the dolt.


[25-Jun-18 08:19 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Agreed, do you think that the host and owner Woof's past behavior will have an effect on the case?


[25-Jun-18 08:20 PM] waltor#3519
Woof's case will most likely never get noticed unless he files a CoC case.


[25-Jun-18 08:20 PM] waltor#3519
*cough*


[25-Jun-18 08:20 PM] waltor#3519

Woof, a known enemy of this show and it's staff, has resigned from his seat. He has also informed the public via #today-tonight that he will "be taking an extended period of leave". We are now unsure of what this will mean for the many upcoming CoC cases involving Woof. More on this story as it develops.

The High Courts rulings in HCA24 and HCA22 included that the Member for Lyne, Tobycool2001, and the Member for Chisholm, Woof, suffer bans spanning longer than 1 week. Both members have therefore been dissmissed from their positions by the Speaker.

The ALP have officially launched their campaign for the upcoming senate election at a rally in Perth.


[11-Jul-18 01:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Direct Action would now like to show the remarks made by the leader of the opposition in the senate, Senator Matt Monti.


[11-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Matt Monti#4771
"Good Evening Perth!
And Good Evening Australia.
As Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and Member of the Australian Labour Party National Executive, I am proud and honoured to launch the Labour Party’s Campaign for the Upcoming National Senate Election! The Australian Labour Party has always been committed to protecting the rights of Australian Workers and still believe in ‘a fair go’ for all. While the Liberal Government has been ignoring our working class, the ALP knows that hard-working, middle-class Australians are the backbone of this great nation. The ALP is also committed to protecting the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community. The Australian Labour Party has always been a friend to the Queer Australian Community. As a Queer Australian myself, I am so proud to be a member of a party that supports my community through thick and thin! I also personally commit to representing the interests of the LGBT community in the Parliament and promise to the Queer community of Australia that I will be a warrior for our community in the Senate. The ALP also supports an Australian Republic. The ALP believes that an Australian Head of State should govern our nation. We therefore support a referendum on the issue and encourage the Pineapple_Crusher Government to honour the results of the constitutional convention. 
Most importantly, the ALP promises to fight the Liberal Government and protect the people of Australia. We promise to protect the rights of workers, the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community and the rights of every single Australian.
I would like to thank the Australian People for their support of our efforts in opposition and hope they will continue to support us in the upcoming election.
Thank you all for coming out tonight and remember to Vote Labour!"

As I said on twitter, its not what we expected, or what we hoped for. The fact candidates can get elected purely by party brand, after not campaigning at all, says something about our system. The fact that meme candidates like umatbru can get in, whilst they are completely inactive within the community says something about our system. It may be reflective of elections prior to April 2017, but we arent what we were back then. We need electoral reform, and we need it now. The Prime Minister has already agreed with me that fully simmed elections are needed, to reward those who particpate and not those who just tag along.


[16-Jul-18 04:11 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Agreed. I know personally after travelling over the entire country to campaign in this election, seeing three Liberal candidates, none of whom campaigned at all and aren't even active in the community is disgraceful and I would urge that the Parliament and Electoral Commission work on the reforms our nation needs.


[16-Jul-18 04:12 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Is there anything else you'd like to add Youma?


[16-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Youmaton#1190
That Labour will not give up. This is merely a set-back, but it is perfect evidence for the need for electoral reform. Brigading is rampant, on both sides, fully simmed elections are what AustraliaSim needs to get an active parliament again. We need actual candidates who have a vision, no matter what it is, not people who occasionally vote so they arent kicked out of parliament.

We now have a Liberal controlled House of Representatives that will debate and vote like any House should, and we will soon have a Liberal Controlled Senate that will do nothing but bend over backwards and take the Liberal Bills right in the Ass and enjoy it.

So the Prime Minister is aware. I have asked him a question on Twitter. I would value a response.


[16-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The question is as follows;


[16-Jul-18 04:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
"Can I ask the PM @PineappleCrusher_, is he proud of his candidates in the senate election, who didn't campaign or engage with the people of their OWN STATES, let alone the rest of the nation, winning three seats and turning the senate into a submissive of the Liberal Controlled House."


[16-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
If the Prime Minister would like to respond on Twitter he may do so. Or even better if he would like to make an appearance on this network, please get in contact with me.


[16-Jul-18 04:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I look forward to the response

Hi Matt


[16-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Thanks for Joining us.


[16-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So what do you think has lead to the people of South Australia's outrage?


[16-Jul-18 04:53 PM] Rat#1042
Well, I cannot be entirely sure as I'm not currently involved with these people.


[16-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Rat#1042
However it seems like South Australians want Senators who will be active in Parliament


[16-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Rat#1042
And with the current lot that have been elected specifically umatbru


[16-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Rat#1042
It looks like the Senate may become just like the Queensland upper house


[16-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So, what kind of message do you think this protest sends to the Government and more specifically to the Three Liberal Senators who won election.


[16-Jul-18 04:55 PM] Rat#1042
Well, I respect the democratic process and these people were elected fair and square.


[16-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Rat#1042
However the government needs to look at who they have on their ballot to ensure that they arent just yes men


[16-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Rat#1042
and they need to make sure that they have people who will express their own views in order to further the country


[16-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Just one moment, Sprinkles because we are getting reports out of #deleted-channel that the protest is in response to the Liberal Control of both house. Our understanding here at Direct Action is that the protest is in response to the results of the election, specifically the three Liberal Senators who will more than likely been inactive.


[16-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Anything else you would like to add at this time Sprinkles?


[16-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Rat#1042
Well during my supplementary election in Kingston, I had a number of constituents tell me that they didn't want to vote for Viado because he was inactive despite being people who would support the Liberal side of the House


[16-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Rat#1042
umatbru has not been very active and I would say he wouldn't talk to his constituents about what they want


[16-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Rat#1042
and regarding Maxwell, well. I'm gonna go out straight and say, I don't know.


[16-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Rat#1042
However, regardless I will respect our democratic institutions and will congratulate the Liberal's victory but let's hope this isn't the end of workers rights.

Honestly, its a long time coming. We have seen other countries use to fully simmed elections, and have both their campaigns and parliaments prosper because of it. I am pushing for this change, this swap in electoral law so that those who actually campaign, those who actually participate, those who actually do things for the country, arent punished and arent taken down by those who are completely inactive in all aspects. The house agrees, the prime minister agrees, so many australians agree, it is time. It is time for fully simmed elections!

[18-Jul-18 09:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Youma is 100% correct, and they've touched on all the important parts of the question already. But I think we should also consider carefully the issue is brigading. It's an accusation that is slung at every party at one point of another, but if we want a way to totally remove it from the equation, and make sure people invited are only here to participate and make our sim richer for their presence, then Youma has shown us the way forward.

[18-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope we do come to the issue of brigading later on and will be amused at how it is now apparently an issue but wasn't 7-8 months ago. Regardless fully simmed elections takes a lot of the fun out for those of us who aren't in Parliament, and that itself is already any issue with retaining members. Once you take away our votes that is it what else is there for us to do? While I supported modifiers to encourage people to be active in Parliament I cannot support a fully simmed election especially now that it is apparently a big change that is required because one party feels they should've won more seats in the Senate.


[18-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Youmaton#1190

[18-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So our first Question is from twitter.


[18-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Matt Monti#4771
"What does the panel think of the proposed model by Labour Leader Youmaton, detailing fully simmed elections whilst protecting the right to vote for everyone?"


[18-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Remember to tweet your questions with the #DApanel.


[18-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So @Deleted User how would you respond to this question?


[18-Jul-18 09:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I need a better explanation of it, after all how can people vote yet it be fully simmed?


[18-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Matt Monti#4771
of course,

[18-Jul-18 09:26 PM] Youmaton#1190
Innocent until proven guilty my friend 😉


[18-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Youmaton#1190
Anyways, time to explain my model


[18-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Youmaton#1190
It would be a combination system, and close to elections that existed prior to April 2017. What I'm proposing is a system where everyone has an active vote, including the regular citizens of the country that currently dont have a vote. We do have a population of 24 million remember! This means those who are active within politics can still vote, just like any other voter, 1 voter has 1 vote. This would allow for fairer elections, and better campaigns, but also allows for all of us to still vote and get democracy sausages


[18-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
So remove modifiers and everyone here has one vote?


[18-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Rat#1042
Panel, if the Parliament chooses to legislate for fully simmed elections, how best can we ensure that those away from Capital Hill be involved in the sim?


[18-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Rat#1042
Because in your proposal Youma, for those outside of Parliament, there wont be much to do


[18-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Rat#1042
even in elections


[18-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Youma, please respond to the Justices question then we will get to the question from Sprinkles.


[18-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Youmaton#1190
@Deleted User Say there are 100,000 people living in an electorate. 4 of them could be working around capital hill, whilst the rest of them are just regular voters who are simulated.


[18-Jul-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
So in other words the voters of the 4 people are useless? Why bother voting when the simulated voter gets the only say


[18-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
(people ask that question all the time irl)


[18-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Rat#1042
(ie me)


[18-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Youmaton#1190
Its most reflective, and rewards people for actually campaigning.


[18-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Rat#1042
Youma, how can we get those who 'lurk' in the sim to have something to do?


[18-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
but we see that in modifiers


[18-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Rat#1042
Unless youre elected in your proposal, there really wont be much to do for the time in between elections.


[18-Jul-18 09:35 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Hang on, what is there to do in the time between elections now?


[18-Jul-18 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Unfortunately there isn't now but at least you know there is a point to hang around for the next election.


[18-Jul-18 09:37 PM] Youmaton#1190
Under the current situation, it would be the same under fully simmed elections. However, creating more things to do, establishing more activism groups, these can help those who are waiting for the next chance at parliament. (hey just like irl)


[18-Jul-18 09:38 PM] Youmaton#1190
As much as I disagree with what @Electrum as the head of the BCA pushes as a message, they show what you should do if you arent elected. You fight for what you believe in.


[18-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Matt Monti#4771

So, we haven't heard much from you @LuSing My Religion, what are your thoughts?


[18-Jul-18 09:40 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Do we really want people who only hang around waiting to vote in the next election? Sounds to me like the brigading that is so often complained about. Let's face the facts, if you're only here to vote, you're not gonna be persuaded, you're not meaningfully acting as a swing voter. You're likely just here because your friend wants a free vote.

Plenty of people are here for that, we want to encourage the growth of the sim so we can increase the number of seats not look to restrict the number of seats to just now

Safe seats are already combated as every election the make up of electorates are changed, I think there should be some safe seats and this should be reflected in the modifiers for the lower house


[18-Jul-18 09:46 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Before we come to that, are you aware the MHOC sub has 3,576 subs, compared to our paltry 428. Seems they're doing quite well for themselves despite fully simmed elections.

Of course as mentioned earlier I do notice that your party is now pushing for this after you feel that the Liberals shouldn't have won despite many active members voting for them

Lyne would easily be in the hands of the libs, monty did a lot of campaigning are honestly deserved the win. Chisholm wouldve most likely gone to Labour due to the earlier campaigning, however it would still be close, the thrill of an election. The senate would still be close, however labour did do more campaigning for it.

I think tweeks to the current modifiers system would do that, it would allow people to have a say yet still encourage being active in Parliament. The worst thing the Parliament did was change the modifiers to include memes

More emphasis on the modifiers, negative modifiers, have a panel of neutral members to determine what campaign posts count as effort. Not just one post equals one point to the modifiers. A good ad will be better than someone posting one with just the logo

It's pretty clear to me that tweaking modifiers opens us up to all kinds of problems that could be much better resolved through simply moving to fully simmed. There is no real objection I've seen, nothing truly convincing, and I think the people of Australia who watched this show tonight will feel the same.

We arent the only ones fighting for it. The house supports it, the prime minister supports, the majority of the community supports it. We want to fight for a fairer australia, we want to work for a fairer electoral system. Even if it takes a referendum, or a postal survey, it is certain the will of the public. Allowing for a fairer and more active parliament, allowing for better election campaigns. We need to focus, and improve AustraliaSim!

Independent member for Denison @djello has released a statement calling on the Liberal Coalition Government to "get it's act together".

{Reactions}
🔵 🇼 🔴 

[22-Jul-18 12:35 AM] Matt Monti#4771
The statement from the member was extremely critical of the Liberal Government.


[22-Jul-18 12:36 AM] Matt Monti#4771
"We are now well into the parliamentary term, and we are yet to see any sign of a budget - which the Prime Minister promised would be introduced by now, or any sign of progress on the referendum for an Australian republic"


[22-Jul-18 12:37 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Not only did the member call out the general Liberal Government, he also addressed the situation of the current senate.


[22-Jul-18 12:37 AM] Matt Monti#4771
"We haven't even seen the Senate conduct business since Bsharri was Prime Minister."


[22-Jul-18 12:38 AM] Matt Monti#4771
We also saw the member call upon the Prime Minister to do his job.


[22-Jul-18 12:38 AM] Matt Monti#4771
"We need to see the Prime Minister and his Government step up and govern the country."


[22-Jul-18 12:40 AM] Matt Monti#4771
The Member finished the statement with a call to the government to actually govern the country.


[22-Jul-18 12:40 AM] Matt Monti#4771
"The government must ask themselves whether they really do want to lead this nation. And if they do want to lead, then they need to stand up and get on with it."


[22-Jul-18 12:41 AM] Matt Monti#4771
The member did clarify that this does not mean he will defect from the government, but it does show that the bonds in this Government are on a knifes edge.


[22-Jul-18 12:42 AM] Matt Monti#4771
It will be interesting to see how the Prime Minister will respond.

Good Morning Australia,
Rumours of a mass protest being organised are circulating around political organisations across the nation.
These rumours claim that a mass protest on the steps of Parliament is being planned for the coming days.
I must emphasize, these are only rumours at this point in time. Direct Action can not confirm or deny that these rumours are in fact true.
It has been claimed that these protest are being organised by working class Australians in response to the failure of the Liberal Party to Govern and in agreement with the statement released by Independent MP Dyljam.
Direct Action did ask the Leader of the Opposition for a comment on the rumoured protest. We received this response.
"Let me be clear, I am not directly involved or affiliated with this protest. That being said, if the rumours are true, I would be more then proud to speak at such a gathering."
If this is true, it signals a weakening of the Australian public’s faith in a Liberal Coalition Government. 
We’ll keep you informed of any developments in this story as they occur. 
Thank all so much tuning into Direct Action this Morning.

Thank you!
Welcome Everyone!
It is so good to see everyone here today protesting this lazy, lying liberal government.


[03-Aug-18 09:20 PM] Matt Monti#4771
As Leader of the Labour Party in the senate, I have experienced first-hand, the laziness of this Pineapple_Crusher, Liberal Government. Once upon a time, the senate was home of the Prime Minister. It hosted debates between strong policy makers across the political spectrum. 
Now the senate is a baron wasteland where debates come to die. The Liberal Party now have turned this once powerful and influential senate, into a submissive of the lower house. 
Once a bill passes the lower house, it has passed the upper house, unamended, under this government.


[03-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The people of Chisholm and Brisbane have a choice tomorrow. They have a choice about what they want from their government. Do they want a strong Labour government, with a strong Leader in Youmaton. Do they want a Government that will protect them. Who will protect their family and their rights as citizens of Australia? 
Or, do they want a lazy, corrupt, out of touch Government run by a spineless leader. If they do, they should vote Liberal in the By-Elections tomorrow. If they don’t, they should vote for the Labour party.
I want to wish the best of luck to Labour Candidates @WillShakespeare  and @Shrub  and encourage the people of Brisbane and Chisholm to get behind them!


[03-Aug-18 09:21 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Remember this Australia. A vote for Labour tomorrow, is a vote for change, for prosperity, for protection, for the rights of workers, for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community, and most importantly, a vote for Labour is a vote for the future!


[03-Aug-18 09:22 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Thank you all for coming out tonight!
Your voices will hold this Government to account. We hear you, we agree with you and we support you!
Thank You all!

From workers rights and public services, to LGBTQ+ rights and the environmental future of our planet, what Labour is offering, and what I am offering in Chisholm, are policies and principles that will give Australians the quality of life, the hopeful future, and common prosperity that they deserve.

I had high hopes for our current president but things seemed to have remained the same.


[09-Aug-18 10:11 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Since Senator Bellman has renounced his nomination I believe that I need to place this senate back on the right track.


[09-Aug-18 10:11 PM] Matt Monti#4771
We need a President who will be active and a deputy president who will be ready to take over if need be.


[09-Aug-18 10:11 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I will be that deputy President.


[09-Aug-18 10:12 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Once the Senate is allowed to vote upon the issue of a deputy president, I would encourage my liberal colleagues across the floor to support my bid in order to keep our senate active.

Okay everybody so we've got two new parties on the block, it's the United Democrats and Reason. Our two House Indies, despite their campaign for strong independent representation, have now jumped over to the Democrats. With the formation of CM's meme party, we have no independents in Parliament.

[19-Aug-18 11:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
It seems that the once unified right of the Liberal party has split. Several former Liberal Members have now joined the Nationals. Whilst the Justicialist Party have been formed by former Socialist member CM. From what we currently know the Reason Party is a new centrist party and The United Democrats is a combination of ex-high court justices and former "independents"


[19-Aug-18 11:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So we thought we just mention two of the new United Democrats MPs


[19-Aug-18 11:57 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Member for Denison Dyljam and Member Brisbane DirtySaiyan both rans campaigns based on their independent status. Claiming to be the best fit for the job because they weren't bound by a party.

In the ad he pulled out the old "Far Left is Communist and can't be trusted. Vote Liberal".


[21-Aug-18 06:23 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The ad stated: "For too long, we've had crypto-Communists under the guise of Social Democracy invading our political system, causing turmoil, causing chaos everywhere but outside of the department that pays their checks. They'll increase taxes, and they'll create an economic depression so big that the only things that can compete in the immense size of this is their egos and their stupidity."


[21-Aug-18 06:24 PM] Matt Monti#4771

Good to hear! So you have told me you wish to wait until the general election to run for a seat, which seat do you plan to run for?


[21-Aug-18 09:16 PM] TheGRV#7916
I plan to run for the seat of Gorton as I come from the area.


[21-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Youmaton#1190
As you may know, this is currently the Prime Ministers seat. What can you bring to Gorton that you think the PM cant?


[21-Aug-18 09:20 PM] TheGRV#7916
I seek to be more acknowledging of LGBTIQ+ Issues and The Western Suburbs are of course rapidly increasing in population. The Melton Line must be made part of the Surburban Network quickly. My constituents shouldn't have to go to Watergardens or Sunbury to have frequent services.

[21-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Youmaton#1190
What message do you have for the Prime Minister?


[21-Aug-18 09:29 PM] TheGRV#7916
The Prime Minister has to understand that this region is largely made up of migrants and they aren't a cause of issues. Anglo-Saxon's make up much of the crime. Additionally, a large number of families live in this region and that presents with it a large number of youth with many being more supportive of Labour values. If you continue maintaining a party ideal of supporting big business over families. I truly believe that you might lose the seat.

To those from the PFC, UDP, Nationals or Liberals?


[21-Aug-18 09:38 PM] TheGRV#7916

The states of New South Wales and Victoria have been in complete and utter disarray with regard to public transport for a period of decades. Successive governments have failed to ensure that public transport is of an adequate standard for much of the states in question.


[23-Aug-18 03:41 PM] TheGRV#7916
If it may be made known. Caroline Springs Station was not properly thought through.


[23-Aug-18 03:49 PM] TheGRV#7916
The area is near the surrounding suburbs of Sydenham, Taylors Hill, Delahey and Hillside. Yet amazingly this station was made part of the Melton line and On Monday-Friday after 5:00 PM, Here's the times services stop there when coming from Southern Cross: 17:50, 18:11, 18:53, 20:11, 20:12, 21:13, 21:50, 22:28, 23:47.


[23-Aug-18 03:54 PM] TheGRV#7916
This station is a farce. Watergardens Station is twenty minutes from the station in question and has far more frequent services. There is no way the Prime Minister can honestly defend this. I therefore will state that should I be elected. I will propose to Parliament that the Melton Line will be made part of the existing Sunbury line.

{Reactions}
🤔 

[23-Aug-18 04:00 PM] TheGRV#7916
We'll proceed to other portions of the state.


[23-Aug-18 04:01 PM] TheGRV#7916
While it is appreciable that the South Morang line has been extended to Mernda. The line should be further extended to the original terminus of Whittlesea.


[23-Aug-18 04:06 PM] TheGRV#7916
It is an embarrassment to the state that services were withdrawn from Mildura in 1993. They should be returned to that line. The line is not in disrepair as freight trains are still servicing the route. The failure in not serving Country passengers should make the Liberals and their Coalition members in the Nationals feel ashamed.


[23-Aug-18 04:13 PM] TheGRV#7916
I accept the North East Link should go ahead but it should not be at the compromise of not having a Doncaster line. That line has been proposed for years and should be operational by 2025.


[23-Aug-18 04:13 PM] TheGRV#7916
and I aim to present legislation to ensure that.


[23-Aug-18 04:15 PM] TheGRV#7916
I apologize for not having content on Trams, Buses or Roadworks. The main focus is Rail. That leads us to New South Wales.


[23-Aug-18 04:17 PM] TheGRV#7916
Under Gladys Berejiklian and Andrew Constance, This state has seen some of the most disastrous rail practices I've seen in my life.


[23-Aug-18 04:25 PM] TheGRV#7916
On Saturday, with a Bledisloe Cup game at ANZ Stadium,Sydney Trains told travellers at midday to "delay non-essential travel" or use local buses because services were experiencing "major delays". - Sydney Morning Herald.


[23-Aug-18 04:27 PM] TheGRV#7916
It was later revealed a metallic balloon caused these issues. If the network can be taken down with that. How can the public hold any confidence in the service.


[23-Aug-18 04:29 PM] TheGRV#7916
To add to this. The government announced the closure of Clyde railway station. Frankly that's a disgrace. I will introduce policy to ensure no railway station is to be permanently closed.

[23-Aug-18 04:39 PM] TheGRV#7916
Further to ensure the rail system doesn't result in total debacle. I urge that trains run at minimum on 10 minute frequencies on the Surbaban Rail Network in New South Wales. That concludes transport. Leave was granted to proceed on to NSW Sporting Grounds.


[23-Aug-18 04:44 PM] TheGRV#7916
I will not tolerate taxpayers money being spent on demolishing 30 and 18 year old stadiums. That is not good practice. Therefore I will have it put that Sydney Football Stadium and ANZ Stadium are not to be demolished until it is independently determined that the stadiums would be dangerous to public safety if not rebuilt.


[23-Aug-18 04:49 PM] TheGRV#7916
As the subject is concluded. As shall be practiced for all subjects I seek to raise. I seek leave from @Youmaton  to enter into Parliamentary Reform.


[23-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Youmaton#1190
Of course


[23-Aug-18 04:59 PM] TheGRV#7916
Members of the leading party shouldn't be allowed to ask questions of their own, Dorothy Dixers stiffle question time and lessen the time with which an Opposition and Crossbench can obtain answers from the leading party.


[23-Aug-18 05:00 PM] Youmaton#1190
I do not endorse these comments, however I respect the party member may have them


[23-Aug-18 05:02 PM] TheGRV#7916
If the leader may indulge in why they do not endorse them it would be appreciated.


[23-Aug-18 05:02 PM] Youmaton#1190
I think allowing the public to ask questions of their own opens the government to scrutiny from all sides. We have questions with notices and questions without notice to establish a distinction.


[23-Aug-18 05:03 PM] TheGRV#7916
I will note that "Members" in this context referred to MP's. Not the Public.


[23-Aug-18 05:04 PM] Youmaton#1190
Both MP's and Senators can ask questions in both Questions with notice and questions without notice


[23-Aug-18 05:04 PM] Youmaton#1190
Members of the public can ask questions in questions with notice


[23-Aug-18 05:06 PM] TheGRV#7916
I will clear up the remarks. In Questions without notice. MP's and Senators of the leading party should not be allowed to ask questions.


[23-Aug-18 05:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
Why do you think that?


[23-Aug-18 05:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
Our process is that anyone (MP's /Senators) is able to ask anyone else a question. No matter what side


[23-Aug-18 05:07 PM] TheGRV#7916
As noted earlier. The practice of Dorothy Dixers is not liked by the public at large.


[23-Aug-18 05:08 PM] Youmaton#1190
The government asking opposition questions has proved very popular so far


[23-Aug-18 05:10 PM] TheGRV#7916
That is different to what I have been arguing. My argument to use the current Parliament as an example is that Liberal/National MP's and Senators shouldn't be allowed to ask fellow Liberal/National MP's Questions.


[23-Aug-18 05:10 PM] Youmaton#1190
Ive seen little of that in recent times, since we changed the standing orders

I believe that sexual education should not be taught until the age of 13-14 and it must be basic covering straightforward topics.

On Safe Schools, I find it to be quite disgusting and only aimed to corrupt the minds of young children

As a Year 8 I went through the South Australian SHINE sexual health education. Regarding homosexuality and transgender, I was simply taught "Yeah does exist, this is what it is." Being transgender was described as the state of having a gender identity (on the male/female binary) that is different from their gender assigned by their biological sex. Regarding homosexuality, I was simply told "This is when someone is attracted to someone of the same sex". Would you apply the same description to this sort of education?

I’m happy for sex education to cover these topics but ensure the information has definitions that are factual and that delving into these topics isn’t really necessary.


[23-Aug-18 09:22 PM] Youmaton#1190
*heavily coughs* That isnt correct. Thats not what transgender means.

I would like to thank Robert for a civil discussion where :coc: s weren't issued! I would simply like to make it clear; we are always open for debate here. Even though I feel personally insulted and offended by quite a lot of what Robert says, I won't let that compromise the debate. I'll leave the panel with a final thought, please don't respond obviously. If you had a child who was suffering through depression anxiety and bullying because they were gays, trans, bi, whatever... would your views change? Especially for your Robert. Thank you all and god bless.

[23-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Tonight’s show was all about proving a point. A couple evenings ago I got rather angry and upset with Robert. I proceeded to insult him and challenge his views. I took some criticism for how I handled my disagreements with Robert. Well, tonight I took a different approach. I tried to listen, to understand, to be civil and challenge his views.


[23-Aug-18 09:38 PM] Matt Monti#4771

Hello Everyone. Thanks for having me on.


[25-Aug-18 04:20 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Let's start with the question on everyone's mind. Who's going to win?


[25-Aug-18 04:22 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
Both a left seats from what I've seen. But Lingiari isn't very happy with the greens at the moment. For Pearce, very likely a left wing win. Lingiari is a bit up in the air in my opinion.


[25-Aug-18 04:23 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
Blood_Chrome is pushing a strong campaign, but in a seat that has been held be left leaning MPs (I think) for a long time, he may have a hard time.


[25-Aug-18 04:23 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
I think Reason is going to have the hardest time however. I'm not seeing much love for them.


[25-Aug-18 04:25 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
So, in short. I can't say who will win for certain. But I'm guessing a left wing win in Pearce and Lingiari is completely up in the air.


[25-Aug-18 04:25 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Interesting.


[25-Aug-18 04:26 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
What are your thoughts on the case currently bought before the court?


[25-Aug-18 04:27 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
I think its a waste of time if I'm being honest. The GE is fast approaching. Having to senators who recently resigned, if I'm correct, in the high court for seats they'll hold for 2 weeks if they win, is an incredible waste of court resources.


[25-Aug-18 04:29 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I will refrain from speaking on it given I'm involved. Let's move on to your policies.


[25-Aug-18 04:29 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
What is the vision you hope to bring to the people of Kingston next election?


[25-Aug-18 04:34 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
Help give the people of rural towns such as Marla, little town towards Central Australia, a say in what their politicians do for them. Some of these people have to drive hours to even vote. Giving them industry and chances to grow will be in the front of my mind. My goal is to give those who live in little towns like Marree and Marla the same say as people who live in Adelaide and the more metropolitan areas.


[25-Aug-18 04:36 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
I'm also going to focus on helping the LGBTQI+ youths of rural Australia have the representation and support they deserve. They've been underrepresented, so giving them a voice and a support network will be a main focus also.


[25-Aug-18 04:36 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
How do you propose to bring industry to these places?


[25-Aug-18 04:39 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
Tourism, Horticulture and Agriculture. Rural South Australia has BEAUTIFUL landscapes. And I think due to some less than stellar PR, people have no clue about it. Horticulture and Agriculture is big too. Giving farmers subsidies will help them sell their goods and hire more workers, crops and animals. Fixing rural roads, train tracks and up-keeping train stations too.

[25-Aug-18 04:47 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
I think its a good start.


[25-Aug-18 04:49 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
But from what I've read a lot of it seems like second thought ideas. The Nationals are the only ones with a focus on rural Australia and they're right wing. So I think a left wing party focused on rural Australia will balance that out.


[25-Aug-18 04:51 PM] Youmaton#1190
Topic from an anonymous source, what is your thought on an Australian Republic?


[25-Aug-18 04:53 PM] Artichoke Heart#0303
I support it. Personally, I think having to pass bills under consent of a ruling power is degrading and shows we're never truly our own country. "Oh mummy am I allowed to pass this bill?" "No Australia, you aren't." or "Yes Australia, you can." Its archaic.


[25-Aug-18 04:54 PM] Youmaton#1190
Would you prefer a McGarvie esc model, being parliamentary appointed, or a Youma-Forza esc model, being directly elected?


[25-Aug-18 04:55 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The second one is the only correct answer.

I would like to retract previous statements on #direct-action paying tribute to John McCain. Someone dying does not mean we should erase their abhorrent role in American politics or our criticisms of them. In the words of John Pilger: ```The Guardian describes the late John McCain as a "war hero". As a pilot in Vietnam, McCain cravenly bombed a mostly undefended country of civilians.  When he was skilfully brought down, his life was saved by the very people he was trying to harm.  A true American plastic hero.```

The results for the new Governor General are uncontroversial, though I question why we still have a Governor General at all. If the Liberal Party has listened to the wishes of the electorate and the Constitutional Convention we wouldn't have one at all.

Primary Vote results are interesting. They suggest the Centrist Parties may be able to cobble together a coalition, but only with the support of one of the major parties.

[03-Sep-18 07:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed. And while I can understand some hesitations about being in the same party as people to your right, just because you are in the ALP does not mean you have to agree with everything other ALP members stand for. We in the Socialist Left faction stand openly for socialism and workers democracy, and we can do so while still working in collaboration with others who are further to the centre. This is the only way you can build a coalition broad enough and strong enough to actually hold power in the chaos of our electoral system.


[03-Sep-18 07:22 PM] Matt Monti#4771
THANK THE LORD. The Conservatives were the least popular party in the polls.


[03-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is a good sign. While there is a small far-right minority in Australian society, at least for now they are extremely isolated. We need to make sure that fascist and racist ideas are confronted so they never escape that isolation.

That hot take aside, Greenout is also indicating that the Liberals got over the line with UDP votes


[03-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Youmaton#1190
UDP seems to have backed away from the liberals now.


[03-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Youmaton#1190
One could only wonder what is going through the heads of the Liberals at the moment.


[03-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
It seems to me that while there is the possibility for some kind of larger centrist grouping, Reason, the UDP, and the CA seem to be seriously divided on which side of parliament they want to work with.


[03-Sep-18 08:31 PM] Youmaton#1190
The motion is still sitting at 7-3. Who will cast the final two votes I wonder.


[03-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Rat#1042

[03-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Matt Monti#4771

[03-Sep-18 08:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
With a Greens and Labour MP yet to vote, I think this is a confirmed defeat for the government.


[03-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
It will be interesting to see if parliament is dissolved before or after the VONC passes.

While he will avoid being deposed as PM, this is still a rather humiliating state of affairs for the Liberals and the Prime Minister.

[03-Sep-18 09:15 PM] Rat#1042
He has just blatantly attacked the CA and Labour


[03-Sep-18 09:15 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
This brings it forward from the 22nd, which he had initially hoped would be the date.


[03-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Rat#1042
I think this date may be beneficial for the government


[03-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Rat#1042
They can hold this election quickly and possibly consolidate their power


[03-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Rat#1042
However with the other parties all voting against the Liberals how will the preferences look like in the election


[03-Sep-18 09:20 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
They don't have much time to start striking deals...


[03-Sep-18 09:24 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And former Chief Justice of the High Court is now the government's top choice for their Senate ticket.


[03-Sep-18 09:27 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You'd think that Ninjja, a Liberal already in the Senate, would be at the top, but it seems the Libs have decided his re-election isn't that important.


[03-Sep-18 09:27 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
That sure speaks volumes about the performance of their Senate team, which has so far been dreadful.


[03-Sep-18 09:29 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
With the Prime Minister's press conference concluded, I think it's about time for Direct Action to wrap up for the night.


[03-Sep-18 09:29 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
But before we go, I'd just like to say this.


[03-Sep-18 09:30 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
In 2017, something extraordinary happened. A 31 year old climber, Alex Honnold, completed a 3,000 foot rope free ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Impressed as I am by his almost superhuman tenacity, Honnold's grip on that sheer Californian granite is nothing compared to Pineapple Crusher's determination to cling on to power. He has almost no footholds left. A thousand feet from the ground with no safety net, no route down, just a howling gale of criticism buffeting him from all directions. And yet, he hangs on. He has no choice. Hang on or disappear. Exist or die. And that's why deep down I admire him. In a way, I love him. PC is all of us. Clinging on to our hopeless lives, our shitty dreams. He is locked into an existential rictus of terror. Devoid, as we know, of any other human quality except tenacity; having no spark of wit, no warmth, no empathy, no sincerity. Nothing except his refusal to let go and tumble away onto the blessed release of the rocks below.


What a fucking monster

Our first topic tonight will be the oft forgotten Greyhound Bill. I dont give two fucks about this issue so it should be interesting what others think about it.


[07-Sep-18 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Our first call-in on this question will be from ex-PM @Deleted User, whose government championed the Greyhound ban.

Thank you for having me on

Welcome BC. Well as you would well know the Greyhound Bill used to be quite an important issue in AusSim politics. It seemed to be the entire focus of Showstealers short lived Australia Party, and spurned Liberty Party opposition to the Centre Alliance government lead by yourself. While its not talked about much now, the Greyhound Bill may still be an important issue for some candidates running for parliament this election. Do you still support the Greyhound ban?


[07-Sep-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well it was my government as leader of the Australian Democrats in coalition with the Greens that introduced and passed the Greyhound Bill not the Centre Alliance but I disgress. The Greyhound Bill was introduced to end a barbaric industry, an industry that saw thousands of greyhounds slaughtered en masse and buried in shallow graves. We also saw other poor behaviour by racers in the poor treatment of these animals. My government passed it and we have now seen three governments since then where it has not been an issue. While I may personally still be in support of the bill I cannot say what the view of the United Democratic Party is.


[07-Sep-18 09:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed, sorry for confusing all the various centrist parties. They merge into one in my mind after a drink or two. So, what are your thoughts on the claims by some of the opponents of the bill that wholesale exterminations of greyhounds are taking place as a result of the Greyhound Bill? Some conservative media sources claim a "Greyhound holocaust" is taking place as a result of the bill. Is there any validity to these claims?


[07-Sep-18 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
No validity at all, first of all the ban hasn't come in yet, secondly owners have had plenty of warning of the ban coming in. It is nothing but scaremongering designed to tug at the heartstrings of people and quite frankly lies like this does not lend any credibility to their arguments.


[07-Sep-18 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed. Well you have heard it here folks. There is no greyhound holocaust! Thanks for coming on @Deleted User.

[09-Sep-18 02:09 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Looks like this time he's talking about creating a different marriage for the gays and making the trans folk pay for their own transitions.

At best it’ll be blowing unnecesary money, at worst it’ll mean that trans people aren’t getting the help and support they need- being told that how they feel is wrong, that it’s sick, that it’s a mental illness- it’s disgusting. Being trans is not a mental illness. Never thought I’d have to say that.

I cannot express my utter distaste and disgust for such a proposal


[09-Sep-18 02:30 PM] adamtad#0332

As everyone is aware I have been a vocal critic of the Conservatives but even I was surprised by this.

[09-Sep-18 02:31 PM] adamtad#0332
i too am quite surprised, i never thought they would go this far


[09-Sep-18 02:31 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Yes, there’s nothing better than throwing refugees onto an island that was full of birdshit where they live in squalid conditions and set themselves on fucking fire.


[09-Sep-18 02:31 PM] adamtad#0332

not as a mental health

Hear, hear.


[09-Sep-18 02:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
maybe not because they're lgbt


[09-Sep-18 02:44 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but a general priority ranking scheme


[09-Sep-18 02:45 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
which would probably take into account factors caused by being lgbt, such as discrimination


[09-Sep-18 02:45 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
or dysphoria related depression


[09-Sep-18 02:46 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so, i support ranking that will most likely benefit LGBT people, but not based on them being LGBT


[09-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
It's true that the LGBT community are more likely to deal with mental health problems than thier Heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But I feel Mental health must be treated equally.


[09-Sep-18 02:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

[09-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771

i think disney lobbied against it though and it got repealed, at least thats from memory


[09-Sep-18 02:54 PM] adamtad#0332
that sounds appropriate, however, i would have to do some research myself before making any definitive statements


[09-Sep-18 02:55 PM] adamtad#0332
(talking about creative commons)


[09-Sep-18 02:55 PM] adamtad#0332
what was the serious question you wished to ask before i interrupted you?


[09-Sep-18 02:55 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
ahhh yes


[09-Sep-18 02:55 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[09-Sep-18 02:57 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
in me role as ASFPI director and editor, i like to take a look at party's policies on defence, now, Im intrigued by the UDP's, which seems to prefer a status quo sort of defensive policy, even going so far as scrapping the THAAD plan from last terms liberal government, can you provide any reasons beyond the ones in your manifesto as to why that is?


[09-Sep-18 02:58 PM] adamtad#0332
unfortunately, this is a topic i cannot claim any sort of extensive knowledge on


[09-Sep-18 02:58 PM] adamtad#0332
Dirty or Chrome would have a far better idea than i would


[09-Sep-18 02:58 PM] adamtad#0332
apologies


[09-Sep-18 02:59 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
no you're fine, ill have to see if i can get them to speak to me later on


[09-Sep-18 02:59 PM] adamtad#0332
in regards to Bellmen's statement i do not consider a highschool education to be 'over education' while i believe not everyone should to uni, dropping out of highscool is a bit far


[09-Sep-18 03:00 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
next question, UDP fiscal regulation policy?
Whats the UDP stance on market regulation, particularly in the banking sector?


[09-Sep-18 03:00 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
are you guys laz-faire or more regulation-oriented?


[09-Sep-18 03:01 PM] adamtad#0332
While we do believe in a free market in principle, in light of this banking royal commission it is quite clear further regulation is needed


[09-Sep-18 03:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
what steps would you take then?


[09-Sep-18 03:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
what would a UDP government do to prevent bad behaviour by banks?


[09-Sep-18 03:02 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
oooh alliteration


[09-Sep-18 03:02 PM] adamtad#0332
we will examine the advice given by the Royal banking commision


[09-Sep-18 03:03 PM] adamtad#0332
it is currently under consideration in our party if we should scrap the policy of the 'big four'


[09-Sep-18 03:04 PM] adamtad#0332
however, in any case the advice given by the royal comission be very important in any event


[09-Sep-18 03:05 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
righto, and nothing further?
Because some see this as an opportunity to completely overhaul the sector, make it less broken and fiscally irresponsible
Some are actually considering regulating other parts of banking conduct even if they may not have an issue in these areas
My former party advocated for a firewall between commercial and investment banks to prevent domestic money from being used in large scale financial "bets" by big banks, which when applied in america under the glass steagal act lead to a period of world record levels of economic growth that have only just recently been surpassed by Australia


[09-Sep-18 03:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
would the UDP be in favour of this?


[09-Sep-18 03:06 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
or even simply consider it as party policy?


[09-Sep-18 03:07 PM] adamtad#0332
we would certainly consider such a proposal


[09-Sep-18 03:08 PM] adamtad#0332
hmm it appears the debate has fallen to depravity


[09-Sep-18 03:08 PM] adamtad#0332
i am glad to see we have such mature leader like tabryn and stalinomics

im not really watching abc right now
I heard Griffo try and talk about morality and it triggered unpleasant memories from my high school philosophy class


[09-Sep-18 03:09 PM] adamtad#0332
yes, perhaps the quality of the debate fell quite a bit earlier


[09-Sep-18 03:10 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you learn about metaethics and you realise anyone who mentions morality as a basis for policy is either someone who doesnt get morality or a very deceitful authie

[09-Sep-18 03:11 PM] adamtad#0332
what is your position on the current high recivism rate in Australian prisons?


[09-Sep-18 03:11 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
new word in my vocab, by recidivism i assume you mean return after previous incarceration?


[09-Sep-18 03:11 PM] adamtad#0332
yes


[09-Sep-18 03:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
fuck im good


[09-Sep-18 03:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
basically i think a more rehabilitory focus for prisons is the go


[09-Sep-18 03:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
i like the udp mentioning it, but they dont have a stated, specific model
Which sucks actually because i was hoping you guys were going for the Norwegian one


[09-Sep-18 03:13 PM] adamtad#0332
we do have one


[09-Sep-18 03:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
please, enlighten me


[09-Sep-18 03:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
must have missed it in your manifesto


[09-Sep-18 03:13 PM] adamtad#0332
its not in our manifesto but i will share a bit now


[09-Sep-18 03:13 PM] adamtad#0332
UDP will use three primary methods to address the current high rate of recidivism:
1. Individualized case management for all offender from entry to the correction system up to six months post release, where appropriate
2. Work with the business sector to improve job opportunities with prisoners, through a “Work, ready release” program
3. The creation of ‘AfterCare’ a program that continues to evaluate and aid prisoners on an individual basis for up to 6 months following release.


[09-Sep-18 03:14 PM] adamtad#0332
its important to note that despite our focus on rehabilitation we still believe punishment is an important part of justice


[09-Sep-18 03:15 PM] adamtad#0332
all of this will be based on a needs basis where prisoners with less motivation and a higher liklihood of reoffending will be priotised


[09-Sep-18 03:15 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Aftercare is trademarked as a mental health provider (they're the guys who own and operate headspace), the 6 months seems a little too short, should vary it depending on the crime and individual rate of progress with a max of id say about 3 years


[09-Sep-18 03:15 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
job stuff is good


[09-Sep-18 03:18 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but i really would encourage you to do a bit more on the physical systems themselves, not just when people get out, and i think the Norwegian model actually does that
It also ends up costing less i believe, because its a lot more hands off, less guards per prison etc
As opposed to an individualised case management system, which would then either require a whole bunch of people to manage cases, or overwork a small minority of workers a la public defenders in the united states
So, in terms of overall administration, proven effectiveness and just general squeaky clean human rights credentials, the Norwegian model is the way to go


[09-Sep-18 03:21 PM] adamtad#0332
we will certainly do some more research into the Norwegian model but as i stated earlier i do believe punishment to be an important part of justice


[09-Sep-18 03:24 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
im with you on that
I am of the view that some people really cant ever be released not because they're non rehabilitatable, but because they dont deserve to leave

It is astounding that I have to argue this publically


[10-Sep-18 05:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
And explain piece by piece how a party that argues for repressing Muslim religious practices, bringing back conscription, establish street curfews, burning down abortion clinics, and bringing back the death penalty may be fascist.


[10-Sep-18 05:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Firstly, its worth addressing how moronic this idea is at face value. Is there supposed to be some fascist position on Climate Change that we should be looking for in that section of their manifesto?


[10-Sep-18 05:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Obviously the entirety of their program is not going to be hyterical racism and authoritarianism. But neither was the program of the Nazis or the Italian fascists. Like the Australian Conservatives, they knew that they had to offer more to people than just unbridled authoritarianism.


[10-Sep-18 05:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Nazis also spoke of farmers as the backbone of the nation and promised them concessions, about the sanctity of children and the need to defend them, about creating jobs for the unemployed, ect. And these were never just harmless little policies of theirs, they were insidious methods by which they could try to win over certain segments of the population over to their reactionary cause. Just because the Australian Conservatives manifesto is not 17 pages of "KILL THE MUSLIMS" does not mean the fundamental dynamic of fascism is not clear as daylight on its pages.


[10-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now before we talk about what is substantively and obviously fascist, it is worth addressing what fascists actually want to do, their aims.


[10-Sep-18 05:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
And while I agree the Australian 60's were not fascist, lets be clear about what kind of country this was at the time. A country of open racial hatred and segregation, where aboriginal children were stripped from their parents, where non-white migrants were not allowed into the country, where women were kept out of the workforce, where workers were viciously repressed by draconian anti-strike laws, and where the Prime Minister Robert Menzies was an open Nazi sympathiser. Here he is quoted on his visit to Nazi Germany in the early 30's: "abandonment by the Germans of individual liberty and of the easy and pleasant things of life has something rather magnificent about it … they have erected the state, with Hitler as its head, into a sort of religion which produces spiritual exaltation that one cannot but admire”.


[10-Sep-18 05:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
So let us not act like there is anything normal or sane in wanting to return to this chapter in the Australian past.


[10-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
That said, whether Australia in the 60's was fascist is entirely irrelevant to the question of whether the aims of the Australian Conservatives are fascist in wanting us to return to a semblence of that period.


[10-Sep-18 05:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
As I have said several times, fascism is a reactionary movement. It does not matter if what they are reacting to is simply the last 30  to 40 years of post-White Australia migration or the gains of women and minorities since then. It also does not matter if the mythologised past they want to return to is what they think it is.


[10-Sep-18 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
**I urge people to take this deathly seriously. I have not and never will use the term fascism loosely. I use it now in a very pointed and determined way because I think it perfectly describes what the Australian Conservatives stand for and what their aims are. I encourage genuine and honest debate on this question with those that disagree with me, but to those that do: Open your eyes. See the writing on the wall.**

[02-Oct-18 11:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Good Evening,


[02-Oct-18 11:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
As you all well know, tonight has been a hectic and eventful one. The Labour Party had unfortunately collapsed. With Hoog forming the Unity Party, both Youma and Myself saw the collapse as inevitable. I therefore formed the Socialist Party of Australia for members of the Socialist Left Faction of the ALP to join.


[02-Oct-18 11:53 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I am deeply saddened to see the death of the party. I loved the party, no matter its flaws and Youma was my leader. So the Socialist party have committed to supporting Youma as leader of the opposition. We also would like to say that we will not resign from Parliament. With the collapse of the Party, all MPs who are now part of the Socialist Party have been asked to remain in parliament to provide some stability in this crazy time.


[02-Oct-18 11:54 PM] Matt Monti#4771
It’s a truly sad night for our country. But the sun will rise. The Left will rise. And the Socialists will rise. 
For the Many, Not the Few!
Thank you all.

For those of you missed it, I called Griffo a terrible person. Like any good person should.


[12-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Asked why the Fuck Chisholm is even considering a Homophobe to be their MP.


[12-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Matt Monti#4771
And told people to wake the fuck up and realise we need to take back our fucking country.


[12-Oct-18 09:43 PM] Matt Monti#4771
And with that, I will take a moment to enjoy my own solo episode of "Wine & Politics"  since every other Politician at the moment is too nice and proper to talk about what Griffo really is.

since your on the High Court it's best I don't make you talk about the Homophobe who is the source of my meltdown tonight


[12-Oct-18 09:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
but just so you know, you're welcome to drink beside me as long as we are on air.


[12-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Rat#1042
Yes, I cannot say anything unless it is brought into the High Court


[12-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Can I bring him to the high court for being an idiot and a homophobe?


[12-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
or is that not allowed?


[12-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Rat#1042
Well, I can't really give you legal advice...


[12-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I might just do it anyway


[12-Oct-18 09:53 PM] Rat#1042
But you can always seek leave of the Court

[12-Oct-18 09:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I'm pretty sure Griffo is a big gay


[12-Oct-18 09:55 PM] Rat#1042
Well, Justice can only be served if someone brings it to the Court's attention


[12-Oct-18 09:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
he's homophobic because no guy wants to fuck him


[12-Oct-18 09:55 PM] Rat#1042
Thus if you want to see it happen, you can seek leave of the High Court


[12-Oct-18 09:55 PM] Rat#1042
and then each party can plead their case


[12-Oct-18 09:56 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So he just pretends to be straight. But the problem is women don't want him either.


[12-Oct-18 09:56 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Though really I can't talk.


[12-Oct-18 09:56 PM] Matt Monti#4771
My husband left me and my boyfriend disappeared and both have left me to parent 2 children on my own.

[12-Oct-18 09:58 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Ok Justice I'm going to have to ask you to leave so I can continue my meltdown without neutral drinking by my side.

Good Evening,
After a long evening, I have decided to resign from the Socialist Party. After new Member, Shitpost Goddess. moved a motion of No Confidence in the Party Leadership over my decision to endorse my partner Woof for the seat of Chisholm, I asked the membership of the party whether they would prefer I ran for Leader again, or resigned entirely from the party to ensure a new leadership wasn't undermined. They preferred I left.

I will continue to sit in the Senate as an Independent Senator for South Australia. This is a Seat I won of my own effort and determination. The then Labour Party asked I run a campaign for our senate candidates, of which I was the first. I made numerous speeches and attended many rallies when no other candidate did. I therefore was the only Labour Senate candidate to be elected. I therefore will keep the seat I won. 

I will decided my political future at a later date.
*cries*
It seems no matter what I do, I am not good enough for my so called "friends".

Thank you all for your time.

Now, I will go through each of my original points in detail and explain how they applied to this election.


[23-Dec-18 12:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Firstly, I had no business running and winning Fairfax.


[23-Dec-18 12:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
SDP could have easily said "fuck that" and run someone of their own, and even if I had run against them they would have beat me. There is no reason for larger parties with more voters to hand away seats to minor parties, but every election this still happens.


[23-Dec-18 12:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Likewise there were electorates like Denison that the SDP had no business running in and where their campaigns were mostly relying on Radical voters.


[23-Dec-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Wright in particular is a good example of an electorate where the Radicals could have run their own candidate and still have beaten Independent candidate CSID and the SDP.


[23-Dec-18 12:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
So in this sense the massive success of the SDP that has propelled them into parliament is really a result of the failures of the Radicals. As always, the relationship between two parties on the same spectrum of politics is rarely one of symbiosis but of competition, and all the Left Coalition has served to do is obscure that at the expense of the Radicals.


[23-Dec-18 12:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
.


[23-Dec-18 12:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
The second point was less of a factor in this election because there were less candidates running, though it's possible that one of the left parties, particularly the Radicals, could have snatched a second Senate seat if they had done a deal with the UPD or other forces to their right. No party on the left has so far been able to replicate the success of the Socialist Party in managing to elect two Senators to the 6th Senate.


[23-Dec-18 12:58 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will leave discussion around modifiers to another time. Suffice it to say that the SPD benefited from strong modifiers while the Radicals suffered from weak ones.


[23-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
.


[23-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
The biggest problem for the Radicals in particular and what seems to have condemned them to being one of the smallest parties in parliament was their voter turnout.


[23-Dec-18 01:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is clear that significant numbers of their voters did not turn out in key electorates. This is partially the consequence of having an electoral base brought about by brigading.


[23-Dec-18 01:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the past the negative effects of a brigaded voter base can be mitigated by serious electoral campaigning, particularly on the day of the election in terms of contacting voters and making sure they showed up to the ballot. It is clear that the Radicals did not do this.

I cannot comment on the lists as that would require a more forensic examination of the Left Coalitions lists than I have access to.


[23-Dec-18 01:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
.


[23-Dec-18 01:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Overall, my conclusion is that the Radicals have repeated the same mistakes that many forces on the left have made in recent elections. I have also observed the previous Labour Party and the Socialist Party under Youma make these mistakes as well, though it is clear the SDP has learned somewhat. Only serious electoral strategy will be able to deliver good results.

The most obvious but probably the most unstable choice - **LEFT COALITION GOVERNMENT**


[23-Dec-18 01:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
This would see the Labour Party, Radicals, and SDP enter into government together under Youma as Prime Minister.


[23-Dec-18 01:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
These parties share the most common principles, and there would be very few disagreements amongst them around policy.


[23-Dec-18 01:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
However there are historic tensions amongst these various parties, all splinters of the old Socialist and Labour Parties.


[23-Dec-18 01:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Such a government could see intense personal divisions and possible defections.


[23-Dec-18 01:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
More importantly, such a government would have to do a supply deal with the Centre Alliance or the UDP in the Senate, possibly leading to further destabilization.

A stable but controversial centrist contender - **CENTRE COALITION GOVERNMENT**


[23-Dec-18 01:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
This government would see the SPD jump in bed with the Centre Alliance and the UDP, likely still with Youma as Prime Minister.


[23-Dec-18 01:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
This would unite the various centrist forces in parliament, and is the most stable of all the options.


[23-Dec-18 01:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Such a coalition would deliver the government clear majorities in both the House and the Senate.


[23-Dec-18 01:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
However it would be extremely contentious and unprecedented, splitting the Left Coalition.


[23-Dec-18 01:34 PM] Deleted User#0000

Everything changes but nothing changes - **RIGHT COALITION GOVERNMENT**

This possibility is not as unlikely as you may first think.


[23-Dec-18 02:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
This government would form in a scenario where inevitable post election defections result in splits from the SDP or the Radicals.


[23-Dec-18 02:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
There are several contenders for this. AMN from the Radicals has been known to defect, as has TWF from the SDP. In our graph we imagine a scenario where an MP from the SDP defects and becomes an independent, though this could also take place if someone defected and joined CA or the UDP.


[23-Dec-18 02:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
This would essentially mean that the government would survive, though without the Prime Minister. With BloodyChrome having lost his seat of Sydney the now dominant Liberals would take the Prime Ministership under @GenericCereal. Other iterations of this scenario could see a different UDP Prime Minister as a compromise candidate.


[23-Dec-18 02:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is the only likely scenario for the survival of the government, and not out of the realm of possibility once the post-election defections begin.

While other networks concoct strange fantasies about "Westpac-NAB" and "Woolworths-IGA," Direct Action will be here to tell you that mergers of said companies were never approved by the Government and they don't exist.

Fortunately our studio is in a different building to the ABC and Today Tonight, and we are *not* currently experiencing the kerosene leak that has been afflicting said stations.

This is my prediction for the composition of the House of Representatives after the election


[14-Mar-19 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Fair warning that this prediction is based on favorable outcomes for the Liberal Party in the two electorates where they are going to be fighting hotly contested races. There is a remote possibility that they may lose both these elections, awarding two more seats to the Social Democrats.

This government would most likely not have a majority in the Senate.


[14-Mar-19 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
But is the only path to a majority in the house should the Liberals scrape through a win in Perth and Parramatta.


[14-Mar-19 05:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
As you can see here I have darkened the seats that are already confirmed wins. They lean heavily to the left.  I will not be doing this on future infographics.

If they lose their two seats that will open the Soc Dems up to a more flexible alliance with the UDP, one that could secure them a majority in the Senate.

Also worth adding that you shouldn't listen to any of the predictions from any of the other channels because they are always comically wrong. I tell you my predictions based on insider knowledge of voter rolls. Most of the other people who make predictions do so without any real knowledge of the voters at play or modifiers.

So you can see from this that some news outlets have over optimistic representations of the results for parties on their side of the political spectrum. I for one have no stake in the SDP winning and think that they probably dont deserve to win this upcoming election, but that's the way I see the situation trending.

This signals further weakness and instability in the SDP. Youma has lost almost the entire core of professional politicians who served under them in the Labour Party, either to the UDP on the right, in the case of Leisel and others, or to the left, in the case of DKR, Laichar, ect. While at the height of its political power, defections are hollowing out the SDP and leaving it organisationally moribund.

[05-Apr-19 11:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
The government has been caught out LYING about the unfolding homophobia crisis in their own ranks.


[05-Apr-19 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
After the expulsion of Cotote from the SDP today for his homophobic comments on Q&A, members of the government claimed that he was an outlier, and that his resignation did not represent a homophobia problem within the government.


[05-Apr-19 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
But Cotote’s most recent press conference has revealed that the SDP may have known about Cotote’s homophobic beliefs, first raised when SDP MP Eehee defected to the Socialists claiming that there was rampant homophobia and transphobia within the government.


[05-Apr-19 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
The transcript of Cotote’s press conference is in its unedited form below:

[05-Apr-19 11:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
As you can see, Cotote says clearly that he decided to resign his position in the Youma cabinet due to making “comments seen as offensive and contrary to the governments point of view”. What exactly he meant by this is unclear, though it is possible he is suggesting that he was removed from the cabinet because the SDP knew full well he was a homophobe.


[05-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
We at Direct Action call for the government to clarify:


[05-Apr-19 11:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
1) Why they lied to the media and the Australian people about why Cotote was removed from the cabinet.


[05-Apr-19 11:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
2) What was the actual content of Cotote’s statements that lead to his removal from the cabinet?


[05-Apr-19 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
3) IF they were homophobic, why did the government not expel him then and there and instead choose to lie about the reasons for his removal from the cabinet?


[05-Apr-19 11:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
4) IF they were homophobic and the government did nothing substantive about it and initiated a coverup, then does the government indeed have a problem with homophobia where the SDP in particular is willing to cover up and hide instances of homophobia within their own ranks?


[05-Apr-19 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope that all of these issues will be addressed in the coming days, because right now it seems that the government has been involved in a deeply concerning attempt to harbour Cotote and keep his true beliefs obscured in order to retain his support in parliament.


[05-Apr-19 11:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
More general questions about the SDP also need to be asked emerging from this.


[05-Apr-19 11:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Namely, how did a homophobe end up as an SDP MP at all?


[05-Apr-19 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is there something wrong with the SDP if this is the kind of individuals they are attracting?


[05-Apr-19 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
These issues will need to be grappled with seriously by the SDP if they are to have any hope of surviving and ending the bleeding.

When will Youma just answer the basic question: Did they know that Cotote was a bigot before the events that transpired on Q&A?


[07-Apr-19 11:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
It’s a simple question. The Australian people want answers. Question Time, the space which is meant to be for the government to be placed under scrutiny and for them to honestly account for themselves, has seen the Prime Minister ignite this very simple question repeatedly.


[07-Apr-19 11:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
They have now today been abetted in their attempts to skirt responsibility by a President of the Senate who is a member of the government, who today refused to ensure that questions related to this matter were answered clearly and truthfully by the Prime Minister.


[07-Apr-19 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
The government perhaps thinks that it can use these heavy handed undemocratic methods to remain unaccountable on this question. They will not succeed. I will continue to hammer home these basics questions every QT till the next election, and use every other avenue possible to try to hold this government to account.


[07-Apr-19 11:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
The unwillingness of the government to even address this issue with a modicum of sincerity indicates a sense of guilt. Youma does not want to address this issue fully because they know it may expose that the SDP knowingly harboured a homophobe within their ranks.


[07-Apr-19 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
That is a disturbing thought, but it’s one that we have to consider seriously when this government fails to give an answer after repeated and consistent questioning on this issue. If it’s true, then Youma would be disgraced, the supposed commitment of the government to LGBTI issues totally sullied, and I would see no other path but for them to resign.

I hope that is not the case, which I why I again ask Youma to actually address this issue sincerely instead of hiding behind allies in the speakers chair. If Youma indeed had no knowledge whatsoever of Cotote’s beliefs, though that may be hard to believe, then Youma should say so and defend themselves. Instead they have chosen to dodge questions.

```In this case, the collapse of the Youmaton government, in some form, was evident to observers from a very obvious first glance. What was not obvious was that it would fall in such a violent and grotesque manner so quickly. We watched as two formerly opposed parties abandoned traditional ties in favour of forming government, we watched as Government MP’s vocally voiced their displeasure, leading to defections and we watched as inactive members consequently began to become more and more important to the survival of the government. We saw a government rocked by allegations of transphobic past behaviour, we saw a government minister say a homophobic slur live on air and we saw a government lose five MPs and thus their entire majority from a comfortable supermajority (perhaps complacency with such good fortune was the real cause of their undoing).```

Earlier this year a motion proposed by myself was passed by the National Conference of the Socialist Party.


[04-May-19 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
It was supported unanimously by the membership of the party.


[04-May-19 05:58 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
A good motion at that


[04-May-19 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Here it is in full: **that the Socialist Party never enter government with the reformist sellout traitors in the SDP ever again, and that any future alliance between our party and theirs be limited to supply and confidence deals and no more.**


[04-May-19 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
You supported this motion. Why?


[04-May-19 05:59 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Because the SDP have taken us for granted, used us essentially. We were just about the only part of the LC government that actually worked.


[04-May-19 06:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
What did we get in return? Youma running into the arms of the UDP and supporting transphobes and homophobes.

A state-of-the-art supercomputer simulation indicates that a feedback loop between global warming and cloud loss can push Earth’s climate past a disastrous tipping point in as little as a century.

Why did I promise to implement fascism in Australia. Well let me tell you something, I made that statement whilst I was still politically misguided and an egocentric narcissist. I made that statement before the last election as well and if I haven’t already, I withdraw those statements, but would also like to state that those comments come completely irrelevant to this by-election. That’s like asking NKG why he is running for a left wing party when he previously ran a centre-right classic liberal party. That’s like asking why MattMonti is running for Labor when he previously led the Socialists.

You bring up my past and the comments I made but never enacted upon but you never bring up the past of others and what they actually enacted whilst they were in public office in comparison to what they stand for now.

Plupsnup has a chance to respond before he gets his question from our viewers


[24-May-19 07:03 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I trust Griffo is a better man now and I believe it is wrong to attack one man's past and ignore anothers


[24-May-19 07:04 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
A reminder that more of you can submit questions via the #Cunningham tag


[24-May-19 07:05 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
OK Plupsnup your question from our viewers


[24-May-19 07:05 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
"What the bugger is Geoliberalism?"


[24-May-19 07:07 PM] Plupsnup#9685
It is a merger of the words *neoliberal* and *georgism*. What we believe in is a socially progressive society with free markets and progressive taxes. We are what Australian political analysts call a *Small-l liberal*


[24-May-19 07:08 PM] Plupsnup#9685
We believe in the implementation of a federal land value tax and the abolition of income tax brackets on the lower and middle class


[24-May-19 07:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Geoliberalism is Plups’ excuse to be egocentrical and run his own party instead of uniting the right under a broad but factionalised party. If he had a large team and group of supporters it would be understandable, but whilst he polls at 2% and has no chance tying an elected member it just becomes a roadblock against defeating the terrible left-wing socialist government.


[24-May-19 07:09 PM] Plupsnup#9685
We are right wing social democrats with an emphasis on economic freedom

[24-May-19 07:12 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
We have another question for Griffo


[24-May-19 07:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
"If you once supported full implementing fascism in Australia, how can we be sure you won't return to it, especially considering your support for forced labour?"


[24-May-19 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
How can the people be sure that I won’t return to fascism? Well I haven’t now and I don’t intend to for two main reasons. The first is that I suffered the consequences of making the statement and experienced the backlash against me and second is because I am a newly enlightened man which I have spoken about on the campaign trail. Now I don’t support forced labour, it was a policy which I originally supported but then realised won’t work for financial and practical reason but I withdrew it. I’d also like to point out that despite making claims that I support child labour and keeping coal as our primary source of energy, the Greens have failed to provide me with any quote which I have made to support those suggestions and I ask them to do so as soon as possible.


[24-May-19 07:19 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Let me be clear that I support voluntary National Service in the labour market, for anyone between the ages of 14 to 18 and also rewarding them with a pension, super and a medal. To them it will just be another school elective they are rewarded  by. It will also look good on their resume!

[24-May-19 07:33 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

[24-May-19 07:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Secondly, I think it’s okay to go out with a 17 year old at any time. When I am actually 61, if my grandson is 17, I will go out with him to a show or go out and walk around the block. If a 17 year old vlogster who is wearing moon boots wants to go out with me to a restaurant and interview me over my political beliefs or what I think about the latest football game, I’d be fine to do so.

I'll be honest, I am more closely aligned to the ALP then I am to the LDP, which is why I am preferencing them second and third respectively. I have forgiven Porridge, Dicky and Griffo for trying to deregister the LRP. I am however grateful that the LDP is preferencing me second. I  have no hard feelings towards the LDP. I do not view Porridge as a rival and I doubt he views me as one. That is all

Direct Action is back.


[01-Aug-19 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Tonight we have a special episode of hit left-wing podcast Direct Action where I, Bsharri, your wonderful host, will discuss the recent motion attacking the Revolutionary Socialist Party in the Senate.


[01-Aug-19 10:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Let us go through this motion piece by piece.


[01-Aug-19 10:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
The first clause:


[01-Aug-19 10:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
```Recognises that the current government is receiving confidence from a party which advocates a “revolutionary overthrow[ing] of the existing order and the smashing of the capitalist state”.```


[01-Aug-19 10:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Firstly, before we get into anything else, the whole premise of this motion is that I have signed some kind of supply and confidence deal with the United Democratic Party. This is simply untrue. All that is happened is that I have told the United Democratic Party that I will not vote in favour of Liberal Votes of No Confidence.  To explain why I have done this, let us look to Trotsky:.


[01-Aug-19 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
In this pamphlet "For a Workers United Front Against Fascism," Trotsky had the following to say about the orientation socialists should have to establishment bourgeois establishment parties (like the UDP), and far-right and fascist parties (like the Liberal Party, at least a section of which is fascist):


[01-Aug-19 10:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
```There are seven keys in the musical scale. The question as to which of these keys is “better” – do, re, or sol – is a nonsensical question. But the musician must know when to strike and what keys to strike. The abstract question of who is the lesser evil – Brüning or Hitler – is just as nonsensical. It is necessary to know which of these keys to strike. Is that clear? For the feeble-minded let us cite another example. When one of my enemies sets before me small daily portions of poison and the second, on the other hand, is about to shoot straight at me, then I will first knock the revolver out of the hand of my second enemy, for this gives me an opportunity to get rid of my first enemy. But that does not at all mean that the poison is a “lesser evil” in comparison with the revolver.```


[01-Aug-19 10:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
So, in refusing to vote for Liberal Votes of No Confidence, and yes, allowing the United Democratic Party to continue to hold government, I am knocking the gun out of the hand of a much greater threat: the neoliberal authoritarian racists in the Liberal Party and the fascist lunatics within it like Griffo. If the price of keeping Porage out of power is a UDP government, I am more than willing to pay it.

[01-Aug-19 10:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, onto the second clause:


[01-Aug-19 10:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
```Condemns the Government for receiving confidence and supply from a party which openly advocates unlawful activities, such as a “revolution [which] involve[s] workers taking control of their workplaces, dismantling existing state institutions…”```


[01-Aug-19 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Apartheid, slavery, the Holocaust. These things were all law. I say damn the law. The law, as we know it today, is the legality of the bourgeois state, which is written and employed in the interests of the oligarchs and the elites and not the interests of the toiling masses.We in the Revolutionary Socialist party advocate openly for the breaking of unjust and immoral laws and will continue to do so! So once again, guilty as charged!


[01-Aug-19 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
The third clause:


[01-Aug-19 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
```Reaffirms that the Radical Socialist party has unequivocally stated in their manifesto that they “won’t enter government with capitalist parties like the… UDP”, and that receiving confidence from them is an abhorrent act of greed and hypocriticialism on the part of the RSP.```


[01-Aug-19 10:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
The fourth clause:


[01-Aug-19 10:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
```Further condemns the Government for dealing with a party which seeks the “total abolition of the Australian Border Force and the Australian Security Intelligence Organization”, which would detract from Australia’s sovereignty and damage our national biosecurity.```


[01-Aug-19 10:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Once again, guilty as charged. We oppose the nation state and all of its associated concepts and institutions, including "Australian sovereignty." We are not in favour of gargantuan spy agencies and militarized border armies. We believe that such institutions, particularly if they were ever to fall into the hands of the deranged authoritarians in the Liberal Party, could be put to even more devastating and nefarious use than they are now.


[01-Aug-19 10:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
The fifth clause:


[01-Aug-19 10:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
```Is appalled that the Revolutionary Socialist Party advocates for “mass union militancy, strikes, and civil disobedience”, noting that this is much more violent, destructive and dangerous than mere civil disobedience associated with protest movements which have significantly improved our democracy.```


[01-Aug-19 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Remember the history of their disgusting evil party! This is the party of Robert Menzies, a man who admired Nazi Germany and championed the Stolen Generations. This is the party of John Howard, the man who introduced the gay marriage ban and locked up refugees in concentration camps.


[01-Aug-19 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
The sixth clause:


[01-Aug-19 11:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
```Calls for the Government to cease deals with the Revolutionary Socialist Party.```


[01-Aug-19 11:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
The government cannot renege on a deal they never signed. I suggest the pathetic Liberals turn their attention away from trying to break up a deal that simply does not exist and focus on their own internal mess. They have a pack of rabid racists in their ranks and a leader who has lost four elections in a row. Their disgusting antics in the Senate are their latest attempt to deflect attention away from the stark reality that their party is deeply unpopular, deeply unloved, and deeply dysfunctional.

Hello Australia, it's I, Lucy, AKA DKR, bringing Direct Action back up to two!

Anyway, we've got a spicy solo broadcast for you tonight, as we continue on with Direct Action's proud tradition of speaking truth to power, though most of the time that truth is "bugger off you're a real son of a gun"


[23-Aug-19 09:08 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
As that's what power is in this country, a congealed mass much like the Master from Fallout 1, a screaming ball of flesh that operates in every avenue to impoverish the average Australian, to bring about misery to their life


[23-Aug-19 09:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And in that vein it is, I believe, in the interest of the nation for this broadcast to be about mental health.


[23-Aug-19 09:18 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now what's strange about this is that it's become a political issue, but for all the wrong reasons. Because as I hope to make clear to you by the end of this broadcast, mental health is a political issue, but for reasons that you're sure as hell not gonna see talked about in Parliament.


[23-Aug-19 09:19 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now the UDP have made much of their commitment to mental health, and for that I do have to thank them, the youth suicide taskforce and whatnot, but it's a thanks that can only be extended so far as you can fall to your knees in gratitude for the bloke who sticks duct tape over your collapsed wall

Let us consider, by way of illustration, the case of unemployment. Now, there is a distinct, and a well established, correlation between unemployment and mental health issues. The psychological effect of being turned away from jobs, especially menial ones such as waitressing, cleaning, delivering pizzas, and the like, is immense. It is harmful. The reason is should cause such harm is because we live under a neoliberal world order, one that actively equates economic success with your worth as a person. In fact, it must make this equivalence, because that is how it survives. If the vast majority of the population were not under the belief that the ultra wealthy are there through strength of their character, rather than through circumstance and the markedly unjust structure of our economic system, they would just about tear the whole thing down.


[23-Aug-19 09:30 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
This means that we have two things that are in conflict. We have the processes of capitalism equating economic success with personal deservedness, and positing that economic failure is caused purely by deficit of character, while simultaneously rigging the deck so that only an absolute minority of people may actually achieve any measure of serious economic success. To bring us back to unemployment, capitalism necessitates that a portion of the population, the Reserve Army of Labour, be permanently unemployed to undercut the bargaining power of unions, by providing the threat of the idle who are ready to replace jobs should union members strike.


[23-Aug-19 09:34 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Of course this is but one example


[23-Aug-19 09:44 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Another way our political system sacrifices us to the grinder, throwing us all into the mashing jaws of capitalism in order to perpetuate itself, is through what Mark Fisher calls the privatisation of mental health. Essentially, Fisher argues that our current discourse around mental illness, through which it is presented purely as a chemical imbalance in the brain, is a narrative created by capitalism to keep itself running. 

Depression is, in many ways, purely rational. Everyday we turn on the news and see that the planet is dying. We see that another CEO has broken the law and will get no punishment. Many of us will walk outside and see a community dying around us. We see people who've lost hope, the decimated skeletons of people decayed by substance abuse. Under this context, there is simply no rational response but despair. How could any sane person be under this barrage and not feel sadness?


[23-Aug-19 09:48 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
But, capitalism cannot allow this. If it allows people to think that their sadness is a justified response to the world, then they will attempt to change the world and remove the cause. Instead, it requires a clinical approach, one that redefines mental illness as being caused by the way we measure it, chemical imbalance, rather than the chemical imbalance as having economic, social, and political factors that may cause it.


[23-Aug-19 09:51 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
This further compounds despair by continuing to present everything as a personal failing. It's not a problem with an unjust and brutal world, it's a problem with *your brain, your chemicals.*


[23-Aug-19 09:52 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I highly recommend our viewers grab a copy of Mark Fisher's excellent book, *Capitalist Realism,* which has some fascinating statistics regarding this, particularly around increases in depression and suicide in Britain under the austerity unleashed by Tory governments, who should be considered murderers for the effects of their policy, but that's neither here nor there.


[23-Aug-19 09:53 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So unjust is this system it turns us towards taking shelter in substance abuse but does not even have the decency to let us have that, it will still nickel and dime us by making us pay for our vices, vices borne out of a desire to escape from the crushing reality of capitalism


[23-Aug-19 09:53 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
It is, in a word, bullshit


[23-Aug-19 09:55 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
But I want to remind anyone who feels like shit that they're not broken, nor is there anything wrong with them individually. While I believe we must work hard to better ourselves, we should eat right, get eight hours sleep, go outside, read, exercise, do everything that may keep us happy, but at the same time we should not believe that this alone is enough. And we shouldn't believe that not doing these things is the reason you're sad. Sometimes you can't do them because you're just too damn sad to!


[23-Aug-19 09:56 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I want people to remember that there's a good chance they are having the rational, and expected, response to a world that is totally unjust and has an economic system predicated entirely on economic barbarity and brutality.


[23-Aug-19 09:59 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Either way, hold strong. A lot of the time the only thing that keeps me going is the belief that the house of cards can hardly stay up forever. One day, we are going to wake up to a genuinely new world. One that is built on something other than suffering and greed. I want to be there for it. I want to step out into that new world, because otherwise, what's the point? Having already made it so many years under this shitty system, why not stick around for its end?


[23-Aug-19 10:00 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
God bless you. Remember to vote for the RSP, or Progressives, I guess. They're the only parties actually interested in turning this system over and not just posturing about how they've made a taskforce or whatever.
