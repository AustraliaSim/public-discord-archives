Plup, I'll debate that in the morning because implying that LVT can enrich landowners is dumb when it cuts directly into their producer surplus through the nature of the levy


[01-Oct-20 07:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's literally a tax on their direct surplus, it stands that they quite clearly do not benefit

The benefit from increased economic growth stimulated by the abolition of deadweight losses onto the economy


[01-Oct-20 08:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
That's only with the Single Tax, which will have a loss for the nation in Government revenue anyway if implemented


[01-Oct-20 08:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The economic growth is offset by a lack of Government revenue to work towards better economic growth


[01-Oct-20 08:01 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
And economic growth doesn't fucking matter if your losing out massively on producer surplus on land

The Government would have the same revenue from the Single Tax because All Taxes Come Out of Rent (ATCOR)

Deadweight loss, also known as excess burden, is a measure of lost economic efficiency when the socially optimal quantity of a good or a service is not produced. Non-optimal production can be caused by monopoly pricing in the case of artificial scarcity, a positive or negative...

Okay I cut off the part where I was complaining about the potential of an LVT fucking over rural areas


[05-Oct-20 01:53 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
An LVT would tear out our current system of doing things, to replace it with one single tax, that may or may not produce sufficient revenue, and it holds the risk of stunting development if one has it at the level you would need it to be to sustain an entire government on it's own, unless you start cutting spending, which isn't necessarily a good thing either. Compare this to simply cutting taxes on the poor and middle class, and hiking taxes on the wealthy, you see more income to the poor/middle class, which results in more spending and more money cycling through the economy as they tend to spend more than the rich, and overall would benefit the economy. We don't need to tear out everything in the book and replace it with an LVT to fix the economy, and it's not wise to be entirely reliant on one tax either. An LVT is not bad as a means to encourage development, but it should not be relied on as our only tax.


[05-Oct-20 01:56 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I agree that we should have income taxes on the wealthy during the transition, but I don't believe it should be a permanent feature of the tax system

> Taxes operate upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine upon those qualities. If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have been contented to live in a hovel, the tax gatherer now comes annually to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than you. If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt. If a man builds a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he has done injury to the state; if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though it were a public nuisance; if a factory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would go far toward making a handsome profit. We say we want capital, but if anyone accumulates it, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege. We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening grain, we fine him who builds machinery, and him who drains a swamp.

No, the land would just be sold and sold with the price constantly declining because nobody wants to pay an excessively high tax on the land


[05-Oct-20 02:06 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
A poor person wouldn't be able to afford the high LVT either

Doesn't matter how cheap homes go, they can't afford the tax


[05-Oct-20 02:06 PM] Plupsnup#9685
It's a tax on the rental value of land, at best the rental value in high value areas is $18k


[05-Oct-20 02:06 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Because you're taxing everyone on land ownership directly and no excess


[05-Oct-20 02:07 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
But if it's according the the rental value of land then it will be nowhere near enough to cover every government expense

Why are labour and capital complimentary?

And why does it include "tax" and "land" in with rent if it's only based on rent?


[05-Oct-20 02:10 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It seems very misleading


[05-Oct-20 02:10 PM] Plupsnup#9685
When taxes on productivity are cut, the rent of land increases in value along with the productivity that ensues


[05-Oct-20 02:10 PM] Plupsnup#9685
It's what the economy is currently


[05-Oct-20 02:10 PM] Plupsnup#9685
"tax" is income tax, GST, etc

Yes, so you'd be removing all that


[05-Oct-20 02:11 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
So why include it?


[05-Oct-20 02:11 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Because it doesn't count towards rent


[05-Oct-20 02:11 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Labour and capital are complimentary because profits and wages are earned income


[05-Oct-20 02:11 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Well in that case you can't cite rent values now to argue for a LVT, if by your own admission, those values would increase, which defeats you citing it as a reason the poor would be able to afford it

Which has to include that whole graph to work as the only source of revenue


[05-Oct-20 02:13 PM] Plupsnup#9685
The poor's real income will increase because businesses will be searching for workers to increase productivity, labour will have bargaining power over capital


[05-Oct-20 02:13 PM] Plupsnup#9685
And there will be a basic income


[05-Oct-20 02:13 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
They won't be wanting to increase productivity if the LVT is so high that businesses can't afford anything


[05-Oct-20 02:14 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And poor people will have to live in ghettos to live in areas where the work is

`In other words, if a policy causes an increase in the fraction of GDP flowing to labour and
capital, the benefit will eventually trickle up to landowners through faster growth in GDP.
In summary, an increased share of GDP flowing to land does not trickle down to labour and
capital; but an increased share flowing to labour and capital does eventually trickle up, in
absolute terms but not relative terms, to land. Perhaps landowners should wait for the trickleup, as workers have been expected to wait for the trickle-down.`

> It very clearly states that it would cause trickle up
 it would cause trickle-up in absolute terms if you just look at land rent increasing, but not in relative terms where earned incomes grow in their share of the economy. Also, the capital value of land would fall to zero or at least become very low when all rent is taxed as demand falls

@Plupsnup Very true


[05-Oct-20 04:33 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Getting rid of taxes on production, businesses would be able to afford paying higher wages. If thats still not the case, the government can subsidise the liveable wage floor, while the business can pay an added bonus, until there is enough productivity that the business owner can then afford to pay it all


[06-Oct-20 08:47 AM] Plupsnup#9685
Also, the cost of living would greatly decreased if the capital value of land falls, which it will. Hence the liveable minimum income would be much lower


[06-Oct-20 08:49 AM] Plupsnup#9685
Also tenants would have increased bargaining power as the rent value would be determined by land valuers, so landlords wouldn't be able to raise rent unless they improve their property, but that increases the improvement rent, not the land rent, and is earned income


[06-Oct-20 10:43 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Rents should be decided by market forces, not some bureaucrat in a government office

That is where you end up in some complex economic theory


[03-Nov-20 02:41 PM] doctor#0002
low inflation means the economy probably isn’t growing


[03-Nov-20 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
A stable low inflation rate helps keep unemployment low, help keep wages raising and the economy chugging along nicely


[03-Nov-20 02:42 PM] doctor#0002
because if you have high aggregate demand then you have inflation and if you have high aggregate demand then you have high economic growth


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
inflation is hardly a problem atm


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Having said so if inflation is too high you see prices of goods outpace wage growth and it actually causes problems


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
ofc theoretically inflation which is too high is ruinous


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
as matthias says it leads to high instability


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
as prices rise too quickly


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] General_Rommel#0190
but atm low inflation is a sign of dead real world economic activity


[03-Nov-20 02:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
And if inflation is too low you see businesses loose income and that can result in unemployment and falling income

well not dead, just not growing anymore

The issue with something like that is normally the ongoing maintenance costs rather than the construction costs. They could spend the money and build it, but if there is little use of it (compared to operating costs) it will fall into disrepair and be a waste of money


[03-Nov-20 03:05 PM] General_Rommel#0190
its not often that it will fall to disrepair because it is hardly used

[13-Nov-20 01:14 PM] NGSpy#8096
why would you impose a 5% levy on people who choose to work from home? they are only doing it to themselves 😂


[13-Nov-20 06:26 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I think it would be because by working at home they are generating less economic activity by not using fuel/public transport/buying snacks or lunch out etc. I reckon that's some of the justification

> an LVT as the single tax and being at an 100% rate would raise $717B nationwide
> $358.5B would go to the Commonwealth Government, enough to back current expenditure if funding and management of education is a state responsibility.
> $250.95B would be shared amongst the States
> $107.55B would be shared amongst the local councils
As I previously said in #deleted-channel


[23-Nov-20 04:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why 100%


[23-Nov-20 04:47 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Because land rent is unearned and it all should be taxed away and used to back spending

@Plupsnup so what would be the point in renting?


[25-Nov-20 10:20 AM] Plupsnup#9685
some people still prefer to keep moving to different locations


[25-Nov-20 10:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
But if I'm not going to make money what's the point in renting the land out to them?


[25-Nov-20 10:30 AM] Plupsnup#9685
You'll still make money from the rent from improvements, you only have to forfeit the rent to earn from the land @Deleted User


[25-Nov-20 02:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Come again? I rent out my land and it all gets taken off me. What's the change? @Plupsnup


[25-Nov-20 02:09 PM] Plupsnup#9685
You'll still get rent from the improvements


[25-Nov-20 02:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why is that exempted?


[25-Nov-20 02:19 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Because it's earned income, whereas rent derived from land is unearned because generating by the productivity of the surrounding community


[25-Nov-20 02:21 PM] Deleted User#0000

[25-Nov-20 02:24 PM] Plupsnup#9685

[25-Nov-20 02:24 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Did you make the land?


[25-Nov-20 02:36 PM] RookWilt#6643
Yeah but he owns the land and he’s renting it out at his own choice


[25-Nov-20 02:36 PM] RookWilt#6643
Plus he may of made the house


[25-Nov-20 02:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is building a house on it an improvement?


[25-Nov-20 02:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
I earnt the land by paying for it, or working to be given it


[25-Nov-20 02:48 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Indeed, so he would keep the rent he earns from the improvement, the house


[25-Nov-20 02:48 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Yes


[25-Nov-20 02:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
So I rent out the house and I'm not paying anything for that and since I'm not earning anything from the land I pay $0


[25-Nov-20 02:49 PM] Plupsnup#9685
No, everyone who who owns land pays the tax


[25-Nov-20 02:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
But I'm not earning anything from it


[25-Nov-20 02:50 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Yes you are, the land rent is part of the total rent the tenant pays


[25-Nov-20 02:50 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Land rent = location rent


[25-Nov-20 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
No I'm just charging for the house if the house wasn't there they wouldn't be paying me


[25-Nov-20 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
How you going to determine how much rent is from the house and how much from the land?

[31-Dec-20 08:13 AM] Kaerus#9569
if most of the wests problems, ie homelessness, paying for vaccination programs, low wages etc can be solved with a fraction of the total populations income (including high earners) I'm not sure why they aren't just solved through taxation. tax dodging is one thing that could easily be undone by a semi-competent government and just adjusting the figures by a couple % would literally fix everything but it's not


[31-Dec-20 08:13 AM] Kaerus#9569
why tho


[31-Dec-20 08:13 AM] Kaerus#9569

[31-Dec-20 08:13 AM] Kaerus#9569
we live in some seriously masochistic times


[31-Dec-20 08:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well tax dodging is somewhat of a problem but the way entities do it vary. 

For small and medium sized businesses it’s just outright tax evasion, failing to lodge tax returns and activity statements, not paying GST, accepting cash payments, not declaring income etc


[31-Dec-20 08:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
For a large or multinational business however it’s less obvious, their size gives them the advantage of being able to funnel money overseers and offset income with losses thereby reducing their tax liability significantly - the difference is that it’s more or less legal


[31-Dec-20 08:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
The ATO is currently trying to apply the tax code more rigorously to those large and multinational companies the challenge is they take a lot of time and the amount of money we get out of it doesn’t always make the effort worth it


[31-Dec-20 08:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Plus if the government turns around and tightens the tax code there is a risk it will deincentivise companies from setting up shop and doing business in Australia


[31-Dec-20 08:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
So it’s a fine line to walk between ensuring taxes are paid and not hurting our attractiveness as a business location


[31-Dec-20 08:26 AM] Kaerus#9569
I work for the ATO lol, I don't think theres anything that really goes by in terms of reporting that isn't noticed by them, if people haven't lodged - we know about it. if people are in massive debt - we know about it.
the cash in hand and overseas stuff, not so much, maybe there are other departments that track that better


[31-Dec-20 08:26 AM] Kaerus#9569

Poll: Will the stock market go up ( 👍 ) or fall ( 👎 )when Biden is inaugurated?

{Reactions}
👍 (2) 👎 (2) 🤷 (3) enlightening (2) 

[31-Dec-20 02:09 PM] doctor#0002
up cause they know stimulus is coming


[31-Dec-20 02:10 PM] doctor#0002
I think it went up on Election Day too


[31-Dec-20 02:10 PM] mikiboss#2416
Down because COVID restrictions will be put in place


[31-Dec-20 02:10 PM] bromo | cchap88#0060
I have not clue anymore


[31-Dec-20 02:12 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
how much going up and down are we talking here?


[31-Dec-20 02:14 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
when people get their checks they just blow their entire $2000 on shares lol


[31-Dec-20 02:15 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
I do think they will go down because business confidence probably gets shaky when a new president is elected


[31-Dec-20 02:15 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
we've had Biden as a Senator and as a VP before, but never as a POTUS


[31-Dec-20 02:16 PM] bromo | cchap88#0060
When Trump was inaugurated that Dow Jones was at 20,000 now it's at 27,000. Should we expect a net loss or net gain after 4 years?


[31-Dec-20 02:16 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
the DJI went up by that much?


[31-Dec-20 02:16 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
surprising


[31-Dec-20 02:16 PM] bromo | cchap88#0060
It had a high of 30,000


[31-Dec-20 02:17 PM] bromo | cchap88#0060
or close enough


[31-Dec-20 02:17 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
it dipped to 21,000 in April


[31-Dec-20 02:17 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
COVID obviously did that


[31-Dec-20 02:17 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849

[31-Dec-20 02:19 PM] bromo | cchap88#0060
He will establish a mask mandate when he starts which is not a hopeful way to start a new presidency


[31-Dec-20 02:19 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
that might dent business confidence


[31-Dec-20 02:19 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849

[31-Dec-20 02:21 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
if you look at the DJI, it did begin to increase after Jan 20 2017...


[31-Dec-20 02:21 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
and kept increasing until ~April 2020


[31-Dec-20 02:21 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
the huge dip is obviously the recession from COVID but it's beginning to increase again nearer the end of the year cause there's a rally

[31-Dec-20 02:23 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
a lot of them are pretty untouchable


[31-Dec-20 02:23 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
and a lot of activity has happened to these companies in particular this and last year


[31-Dec-20 02:23 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
e.g Disney launching Disney Plus on a larger scale worldwide and it being a success


[31-Dec-20 02:23 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849

[31-Dec-20 02:25 PM] bromo | cchap88#0060
If you click on the max date range. You can see that from the surface it looks like the Trump administration caused a massive growth in the DJ. Whether it was all his work or riding Obama's coat-tails...


[31-Dec-20 02:26 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849

[01-Jan-21 09:16 AM] bromo | cchap88#0060
> John Howard, John Anderson and Peter Costello have encouraged the Morrison government to anchor fiscal policy towards future budget surpluses, concerned about the massive financial burden on future generations, warning that if interest rates rise, then debt will have to be paid down faster.


[02-Jan-21 10:25 AM] djello#5901
Question, do any of those three have any economic qualifications?


[02-Jan-21 10:25 AM] djello#5901
The answer is no.


[02-Jan-21 10:25 AM] djello#5901
And some of the things Costello has said have been proven to be false


[02-Jan-21 10:42 AM] NGSpy#8096
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuug


[02-Jan-21 10:42 AM] NGSpy#8096
The thing is, the Liberal Government will always aim for a surplus


[02-Jan-21 10:42 AM] NGSpy#8096
because it looks good


[02-Jan-21 10:42 AM] NGSpy#8096
in real terms however, its less money going in the economy, and therefore less economic growth


[02-Jan-21 10:43 AM] NGSpy#8096
you need to start making surpluses when the time is right


[02-Jan-21 11:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
@NGSpy like when we had a boom and Costello was delivering surpluses


[02-Jan-21 11:05 AM] NGSpy#8096
Exactly. When the economy is strong and programs are strong, that is a good time to deliver a surplus


[02-Jan-21 11:06 AM] NGSpy#8096
The thing is, in Australia there may actually be an incentive to keep the debt low, especially in regards to states


[02-Jan-21 11:06 AM] NGSpy#8096
because if there is any total revenue surplus, it gets distributed to the states under the constitution


[02-Jan-21 11:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well aiming to move towards a surplus will keep the debt low


[02-Jan-21 11:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
@djello I don't think you can discount the words of Australia's longest serving treasurer


[02-Jan-21 11:22 AM] djello#5901
No I certainly can. He’s said several things which can only be described as economic fallacies. He was our longest-serving Treasurer because his boss knew how to win elections (until he didn’t)


[02-Jan-21 11:23 AM] djello#5901
Now here’s the thing. Neither Howard, Anderson nor Costello have any economic qualifications. Frydenberg and Morrison both have economic qualifications. Can you see the difference?


[02-Jan-21 11:26 AM] djello#5901
And Frydenberg can bang on about how he loves Thatcher and Reagan all he wants, but his actions speak much louder than words. He’s a Neo-Keynesian, and despite some slip-ups, Australia is better for it.


[02-Jan-21 12:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes but high deficit has implications on the economy


[02-Jan-21 12:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
yeah, there is risks of inflation


[02-Jan-21 12:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
the accummulation of debt, etc.


[02-Jan-21 01:24 PM] mikiboss#2416
Tbh, I think there is something a bit iffy about how we fetishise the idea of ‘economic qualifications’, in terms of whose opinions do and don’t matter. Like I think it’s pretty clear to people that Keating is a good example of this as someone with little economic qualifications, well little formal qualifications at all, yet has sound economic ideas and policy that *didn’t* just come from the treasury. At least with say an Attorney-General a legal qualification to actually be in a court is really a fundamental part of it, whereas with providing economic insight, I dont think it’s like a requirement


[02-Jan-21 01:48 PM] Deleted User#0000

And another thing with assumed knowledge and the like @Deleted User - I don’t find that they are ever really justified. UoN commerce had hsc mathematics (presumably advanced) as assumed knowledge. I did maths general, hated it, but I’m still doing quite well in econ


[02-Jan-21 02:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
most NSW universities have adjustment factors so if you excel in one or two subjects you're ATAR can get a bump

If you just get 85 or whatever, get band 5/6 in English and one or two more subjects + regional bonus you could possibly make it into some courses that mandate at least 95 @Deleted User

[02-Jan-21 02:43 PM] mikiboss#2416
I fucked up by not doing a 3/4 in year 11 (which I could have done), and by doing Chemistry and Methods. i could have done methods on it's own, but both together took out too much of each others time for study

The school I work at didn't do quite as well as last year (which was a new record for the school), but we will likely still be a top 50 ATAR school (just not published cos you need 20 ATAR students to be on the published ladder). We had a 97, 95 and 92 if my memory is correct. Not bad for only 12 or so doing ATAR

A really interesting note


[06-Jan-21 09:33 AM] General_Rommel#0190
But of course, value always comes from somewhere. If you trace the thread back on any one of these businesses, it’s always the same deal: The poor underwrite the fantasies of the middle class, who in turn underwrite the realities of the rich. When credit cards charge high interchange fees, they pass the cost of loyalty programs on to merchants, who in turn pass it back to customers by building the fees into their sticker prices. Those who pay with credit can earn it back in points. Those who pay with debit or cash wind up subsidizing someone else’s free vacation. According to a 2010 policy paper by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the average cash-using household paid $149 over the course of a year to card-using households, while each card-using household received $1,133 from cash users, partially in the form of rewards. It remains a regressive transfer to this day.

Australia Tax
Australia Tax is a phrase applied to the generally higher prices in Australia of goods and services than equivalent costs in comparative overseas nations such as the United States. This is particularly the case for video games, computer hardware, and software but may extend to non-technological items such as cars, designer clothing and banking s...

We in Australia tend to pay more for things


[17-Jan-21 01:26 AM] perkele!#1337
so I'd have $500 USD to fly to and from the US


[17-Jan-21 01:26 AM] perkele!#1337
which is totally doable


[17-Jan-21 01:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
A good way to see the comparisons is the Big Mac index


[17-Jan-21 01:27 AM] perkele!#1337
That's £370 hang on


[17-Jan-21 01:28 AM] perkele!#1337
yeah I could fly into seattle for £291 round trip on the 1st of feb


[17-Jan-21 01:28 AM] perkele!#1337
that leaves me with £80 to find a shitty hotel room for one night


[17-Jan-21 01:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
you could definitely find one for cheaper


[17-Jan-21 01:28 AM] perkele!#1337
exactly


[17-Jan-21 01:28 AM] perkele!#1337
so it is actually more economical for me to fly to the other side of the US, buy an iPhone, and fly home


[17-Jan-21 01:29 AM] perkele!#1337
than it is for me to buy it in the UK


[17-Jan-21 01:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
also £291 to fly to Seattle from London?

When in fact I have bought 100 quid with 200 dollars


[17-Jan-21 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
So the conversion rate is 1:2


[17-Jan-21 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
But the purchasing rate is about 1:1


[17-Jan-21 01:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
The pound has a slightly stronger purchasing rate than the aussie dollar so when you get to bigger items like phones it's a much larger difference


[17-Jan-21 01:36 AM] Deleted User#0000

> Economists warned that policy makers cannot simply rely on debt-fuelled house price appreciation to grow the economy after the COVID-19 recession and that governments must also embark on tax reform to sustain the recovery.  

> Analysis released under Freedom of Information by the Reserve Bank of Australia suggests house values could jump 30 per cent over three years from a permanent 1 percentage point cut in the overnight cash rate

> Inflating the price of houses and other assets such as shares would increase household wealth, improve household cash flow, lift consumer spending and stimulate business investment, the bank's economists noted in an internal briefing note dated November 23.    

> Nicholas Gruen, Lateral Economics chief executive and a former adviser to Labor treasurer John Dawkins, said the RBA was "pushing on a string" with near-zero interest rates and the fiscal policy of governments had rightly picked up some of the slack during the COVID-19 crisis.  

> "People think housing is a way to grow wealthy, but rising house prices add nothing to production," Dr Gruen said.  

> "It also makes the economy very brittle because when your house prices are seven to eight to nine times earnings, house prices can fall a lot further.  

> "American economist Henry George said we should be taxing the unimproved capital of land – and it's a powerful insight.  

> "At least in principle, such a tax raises revenue without imposing costs – a holy grail in tax policy."  

> While unemployment was a relatively low 5.1 per cent before COVID-19 struck early last year, the economy's productivity and wage growth had been struggling for much of the previous decade.


[21-Jan-21 08:55 AM] Plupsnup#9685
> IFM Investors chief economist Alex Joiner said the limits of effective monetary policy were now being tested and the RBA was looking to governments to support economic growth.  

> "Fiscal policy both in the form of direct stimulus, which is relatively easy spending taxpayer money and highly visible. And more importantly an aggressive reform agenda to bolster much-needed productivity growth – this, while more necessary for the economy, is more politically difficult and less visible to the electorate," Dr Joiner said.  

> Industry Superannuation Australia chief economist Stephen Anthony said the RBA expecting a significant flow through for asset prices was a "one-card trick".  

> Mr Anthony has advocated the introduction of a corporate cash flow tax, reforms to energy markets and infrastructure investment to boost the economic recovery.  

> The government is pursuing industrial relations changes to increase flexibility in the labour market, but unions have opposed key elements of the package.  

> The October federal budget also included some short-term incentives for business investment and acceleration of personal income tax cuts.  

> The latter had injected an extra $7 billion into people's pockets in the last six months, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Monday.  

> At the state level, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet is pursuing arguably the biggest reform, by flagging plans to phase out stamp duty on property transactions and gradually replace it with an annual land tax

> RBA governor Philip Lowe has repeatedly urged the federal and state governments to embark on productivity-boosting reforms to lift the economy's growth potential.  

> He had nominated reforms to tax, competition, industrial relations, innovation, education and skills as areas that are ripe for reform.  

> The International Monetary Fund has repeatedly recommended that Australia reduce taxes on companies and workers, and shift to greater taxation of consumption and land.

> The [Venezuelan] government also installed price controls and regulations on many imported consumer goods (AP & AFP 2003). This was implemented to make them more accessible for the most vulnerable, but hoarding by business leaders who opposed Chavez eventually led to widespread shortages (Weisbrot and Sandoval 2007). As businesses were no longer able to profit from the imports as much as they had before, the goods became unavailable to consumers, except through black markets with larger, more profitable markups (Gupta 2015).

Melvin Capital, to file bankruptcy as soon as next week according to sources.

The bailout they received yesterday from Citadel and Point72 went “poof” today as the GameStop ( $GME ) momentum continued.

The fund was forced to liquidate its Alibaba ( $BABA ) position after hours.

[27-Jan-21 07:20 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Could someone explain to me simply what exactly is going on?


[27-Jan-21 07:20 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
Wallstreetbets is a subreddit...


[27-Jan-21 07:20 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
it has been pumping the price of the GameStop Corporation's stock price


[27-Jan-21 07:21 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
it has gone from $17 at the start of the month to $240 at one point


[27-Jan-21 07:21 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
they have managed to bankrupt a billion dollar investment company


[27-Jan-21 07:21 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
and it's basically rebelling against the big hedge fund companies


[27-Jan-21 07:21 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
people have got insanely rich off this and a short squeeze is starting which could potentially bring the price to thousands of dollars


[27-Jan-21 07:27 PM] kyōsantō#0087
I know about that I was more talking about how did an investment company go bankrupt off this?


[27-Jan-21 07:28 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
people moved away from their hedge fundfs


[27-Jan-21 07:28 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
WSB is actually pretty huge


[27-Jan-21 07:28 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
and active


[27-Jan-21 07:28 PM] kyōsantō#0087
I know, but why did people move away from hedge funds?


[27-Jan-21 07:28 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
WSB somehow got actual big names in investment on their side


[27-Jan-21 07:29 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
and they saw how much money people were making all by themselves


[27-Jan-21 07:29 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
dude made $20 million off this


[27-Jan-21 07:29 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
they discredited people who came after the whole idea as idiots


[27-Jan-21 07:30 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
and got reputation among the trading community


[27-Jan-21 07:33 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so this company had begun shorting the price of Gamestop (effectively selling a stock they dont have with the onus to buy back the stock at a later point, ideally for less) but then when WSB got involved Gamestop went through the roof and now they owe a lotttttttt of money due to the short sell


[27-Jan-21 07:34 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
yeah


[27-Jan-21 07:34 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
WSB's power took this company down


[27-Jan-21 07:34 PM] kyōsantō#0087
Oh okay. Thanks Tbyrn


[27-Jan-21 07:34 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
every day there'd be a post about shorting


[27-Jan-21 07:34 PM] kyōsantō#0087
That was more what I wanted to know


[27-Jan-21 07:34 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
there was a company they just steamrolled


[27-Jan-21 07:34 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849

[27-Jan-21 07:34 PM] kyōsantō#0087

it's stock market trickery


[27-Jan-21 07:36 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
tricksy and deceptive


[27-Jan-21 07:37 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
have you heard of "spoofing" on futures contracts? @Napoleon Freeze


[27-Jan-21 07:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
is that like the guy who bought 99% of america's onions thanks to futures


[27-Jan-21 07:37 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
idk about *that*  (sounds wack)  but basically they buy a shit load of contracts and cancel them at the very last second before they expire


[27-Jan-21 07:38 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849
so they drive the spot price up and people get on the bandwagon and then get destroyed when all of the orders are cancelled


[27-Jan-21 07:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Just guessing here, but I think AMC Networks - the cable programmer that brings you Better Call Saul - is spiking bc Redditors are confusing it with AMC Entertainment - the theater company they are trying to manipulate, which has no connection to the TV company.

The main takeaway from this “Wall street bets-Gamestop-Melvin Capital” situation should be, in my opinion, how influential regular people are when we organize against existing power structures.

[29-Jan-21 02:00 PM] BHjr132#2979
if it hits 10 cents it'll go to #7 currency but then theres a bit more of a gap


[29-Jan-21 02:01 PM] BHjr132#2979
if it goes to $1 it'll be #3


[29-Jan-21 02:02 PM] BHjr132#2979

Well I don't want to punish people who are productive with their property, but not maintaining it and just waiting for prices to rise or an increase in rent from doing nothing isn't productive, in fact it drains wealth from the actual productive sectors of the economy. All it would do is force landlords to maintain and develop their property if they are to keep earning some high income from the building and improvements, while the unearned increment that is land rent is paid in full to the public Treasury

Expansion of the universe
The expansion of the universe is the increase in distance between any two given gravitationally unbound parts of the observable universe with time. It is an intrinsic expansion whereby the scale of space itself changes. The universe does not expand "into" anything and does not require space to exist "outside" it.

There is a finite amount of location in Australia, you cannot create new location, only increase it's value. Whether or not the universe is finite or infinite doesn't matter, a polity can't be infinite in size. there cannot be more than 100% location within a polity even as it increases in size

According to this piece by Foldvary (http://www.foldvary.net/works/policystudy.pdf) land rent made up 20% of GDP in 1986.
Going by the principle of ATCOR and adding in that, taxation in 2020 made up 24.3% of GDP, 24.3+20= 44.3

So if the Single Tax Regime was implemented overnight (impossible in practice but for the sake of the argument), it would raise at least (if land rent as a percentage of GDP stayed at 20%) $9.44T in revenue, $4.04T more than what was raised by all levels of Government in 2018.

For a comparison, Land Rent and taxation made up 50% of GDP here in Australia in 2018, $716.5B AUD, $156.7B more than what was raised in 2018

UBI at $25,000 for everyone above working age (14 years old) would cost more than $544.86B per year
A Single Tax Regime which would raise the most compared to all other regimes would raise a little more than $716.5B.
UBI would replace the current social security system, development can be financed by deficits as the new improvements on sites would increase the revenue from land rent, which leaves everything else with less than $200B to be given.

Rent Control: A Case Study, by Fred Foldvary, Ph.D. | Progress.org
Price control only treats the effects of unaffordability, rather than curing the cause.

[27-Feb-21 02:37 PM] Plupsnup#9685
> So government pushes down wages and pulls up the rental cost of housing. That is why housing is unaffordable. The remedy is the eliminate the cause, to stop the pushing and pulling. Shift all taxes to land values, eliminating taxes on wages, goods, enterprise profits, and interest. With wages high and land values low, dwellings become affordable.


[27-Feb-21 02:38 PM] Plupsnup#9685
> Most advocates of reform call for higher minimum wages, rent controls, and other taxes and subsidies, rather than the fundamental reform that would make these effects treatments unnecessary. The puzzle is why most of the reformers keep seeking to only treat the effects, and seldom seek to cure the causes of our social problems, even when the economics is explained to them. They reply that rental controls and higher minimum wages are politically feasible, while basic reforms are resisted, but that response then becomes self-reinforcing.

😠Insurance companies will happily insure your house, but refuse to insure the land underneath it.

They'll say things like land is 'permanent', it cannot be 'used up', & it 'does not depreciate'.

How dare they suggest that land & capital are fundamentally distinctive phenomena.

Meet the Renegades: Michael Hudson
With every major financial recovery since the second World War beginning in a place of greater debt than the one before it, how could we not have foreseen the financial crisis of 2008? In this episode of Meet the Renegades, economics professor and author, Michael Hudson argues we did.

How could an economy that created so much debt also save the...

I’ve been following Greensill’s actions in recent years, particularly where the paint started to come off, and I can only say his collapse is very interesting, but also very funny to see.

How one Aussie billionaire's fall from grace could wallop the city ...
Lex Greensill's rise from Bundaberg farmer to world-renowned billionaire wasn't your typical rags to riches story, but now he is desperately trying to stave off a collapse that threatens the livelihood of thousands, writes Ian Verrender.

Care to elaborate. I've been following this closely since the financial times reported it last week. But your thoughts


[08-Mar-21 03:07 PM] mikiboss#2416
Sure. Greensill's fortunes and role in the economy is, much like a lot of these emerging capital sinks, backed by SoftBank, which has taken a big role in a lot of these similar types of start ups before. Greensill emerged much earlier than a lot of these other start ups with, well naturally, a focus on finances. Greensill's naturally close ties to the United Kingdom government, particularly David Cameron also gave them a leg up, but it was the time at which they emerged which seemed to cause so much of their rapid growth. Effectively being able to eat another company's debt and record it as an operating expense. Naturally, this was so dependant on the flow however, because that's what they did, make companies which look less profitable, well, look more profitable. Greensill could rely on other softbank backed bodies to try and soften any blow, but this all required a lot of careful manoeuvring, good press, and the continued flow of capital to keep everything moving. it was in 2020 with the expected COVID disruptions where financial journalists really got keen into looking at Greensill's work, and with that, a lot of the positive press faded, and with that, it only took a few small steps for this to suddenly halt. And with that, investors jumped ship, and German regulators then closed the bank, and by then, the pieces of the jenga tower were all in collapse.

[08-Mar-21 03:31 PM] mikiboss#2416
Ah, I see


[08-Mar-21 03:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
The problem is...you have to be building more housing faster than population growth for this to happen


[08-Mar-21 03:42 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
That's why it receives scepticism by some because they don't realise that; yes there is new housing being built everywhere but they don't see the larger population growth that continues to constrict the market and increase prices


[08-Mar-21 03:43 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
So all they see is new housing being built but prices still increasing


[08-Mar-21 03:43 PM] delad#7470
yeah this is it, people see like one or two apartments being built with cranes and think housing must be increasing hugely even if it isn't


[08-Mar-21 03:43 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Indeed


[08-Mar-21 06:54 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Land developers release land for public sale slowly to maintain the higher prices and keep land scarce. It's why I think we need to have a undeveloped land tax. Something along the lines of, if you hold land zoned as residential (maybe some other clarifications around it but not many) and it has been released from government ownership more than 12/18/24 months (something like that) and it is not developed (a house on it etc.) than you have to pay a decently sized tax bill every quarter it remains undeveloped. Use the money raised to increase the supply of public housing. That way the supply of housing either increases by reducing the land being held and not used by developers, or by state governments building more housing

[08-Mar-21 07:16 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Well if we're going to go down that route, we may as well give all undeveloped land back to the traditional owners 😏


[08-Mar-21 07:17 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And now suddenly, it only applies to certain property rights :agony:


[08-Mar-21 07:19 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
People are 'owning' land that belongs to the population of the whole country. They should be penalised if they're not making use of that land because they should only be owning land if it benefits the country (eg with housing)

[08-Mar-21 07:33 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I'm mostly thinking of land released to developers for the express purpose of opening up new housing for individuals/families that then sits unused for years so the developers can control the supply of land to artificially inflate the price of land.

@Plupsnup I do have a good faith discussion question for you. The purpose of an LVT is to incentivize the development of land, right? In that case, wouldn’t it be a form of central planning, as people who own land would otherwise not develop it unless there were market incentives to do so?


[27-Mar-21 06:32 PM] Plupsnup#9685
The purpose of the Single Tax Regime isn't just to incentivise the development of land, it's also to make it so wages once again rise in tandem with productivity. 
Also it's not "central planning", state led development and maintenance of improvements on public land have existed since the State itself has existed. 
It's democratic planning due to the fact that landowners decide how to improve their property without State hindrance, it really only punished those with undeveloped sites and those who own a large number of sites in prime locations


[29-Mar-21 07:58 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@Plupsnup Interestingly enough the current rate of LVT in Namibia is actually shrinking relative to the rest of tax collected

– This budget for the 2021/22 financial year has government spending totalling N$67,9 billion – nearly N$5bn less than the N$72,8-billion budget tabled last year.

– The government's income is projected to be N$52,1 billion, down from an estimated N$55,5bn last year. Against expenditure of N$67,9bn, this brings the budget deficit to N$15,8bn.

– This deficit will be funded through domestic and international borrowing, Shiimi says, and it is expected to amount to 8,6% of Namibia's gross domestic product in the 2021/22 financial year.

– Of the N$67,9 billion expenditure total, N$53,9bn is set aside for operational expenditure, N$5,6bn for development projects and the remainder will be needed to pay interest on the government's debts.

– Because the government is to borrow about N$15,8 billion this year, the national debt will rise to about N$140,8bn this fiscal year, equivalent to 76,2% of GDP, and reach about 84,6% of GDP in 2025/26.

Just make company tax tiered like personal income. Eg. 17.5% for first million revenue, 22.5% for 1-10million, 27.5% for 10-100 million, 32.5% after 100 million

Yes GST takes proportionally more income from the poor, but the more also get proportionally more money from the Government benefits and programs - but again this is about diversifying our tax base


[15-Apr-21 10:38 AM] Perekai#6805
The de facto tax rate for corporations is definitely not what is being collected. Lots of large firms and corporations are dodging tax egregiously. Close those loopholes and the recommendations may not even be needed from the revenue that should be collected.


[15-Apr-21 10:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
The recommendations are not about revenue generation, if followed they are probably revenue neutral. The idea is that the fact there is two corporate tax rates IS a "loophole"


[15-Apr-21 10:45 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Yeah, I don't like the fact that some firms pay 1 rate on all while others pay a different rate in all. If it was like personal income tax where the lower rate was on a portion of their income and the higher rate then kicked in for the higher part of their income that would be better


[15-Apr-21 10:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
It would be better but it creates the issues where companies slightly above the threashold will be aggressively trying to get under and those slightly below the threshold will aggressively try to stay below. 

It should come as no surprise that the individuals most likely to commit some kind of tax fraud are those who are near threasholds.

It's essentially what your priority is, whether something is easy to administer and comply, thereby making it more efficient

[15-Apr-21 10:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
GST is unavoidable - that's partly what makes it an effective tax in so far as it reaches a very wide part of our economy. GST reform more generally has been on the cards for a while actually to remove some of the inefficiencies and possibly increasing the rate which, I will add, is very low compared to other OECD nations. Further GST is very stable and doesn't experience wild fluctuations and can generally be pretty predictable.


[15-Apr-21 10:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
GST was also made over 20 years ago and is a good candidate as a tax that could be reformed to improve how it operates within the economy, yes it'll be about increasing GST revenue but that money goes to the states which are already revenue poor and their programs will overwhelmingly benefit poorer Australians

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg wants the unemployment rate to fall below 5 per cent, but one economist says that still won't be enough, writes Gareth Hutchens.

It's just that, practically speaking, it's nearly impossible to enforce how you transform all those taxes into a movement based charge, and how you deal with negative externalises such as air and sound pollution, things which generally are seen a negative things to be disincentived, but might not be featured in a purely movement based tax.

if only there was a thing that could be done to combat private equity speculation in housing. 

if only blackstone explicitly stated that building more apartment buildings would reduce their profit. 

would be mighty convenient if that was in their annual report. oh wait…

How big were the windfalls at Fishermans bend?
Could it happen again?
Can a rezoning windfall gains tax fix the problem?

> Key findings include:
> + Rezoning uplifts did not consistently occur at FB until post-2015, due to
> uncertainty in the planning process.
> + For land without permits, the average is $469 per square metre. The
> average uplift for permitted properties rises to $1,726 per square metre.
> A planning permit therefore enabled an average return of 368% in our

> + Based on these averages, total uplift estimated for 1,556 properties in the

> Such windfalls would likely cover the public investment needed for Fishermans Bend
> multiple times over, and is of a similar magnitude to Victoria’s $5.3bn social housing
> investment of 12,000 homes. This also equates to a whole year’s worth of rezoning

[23-Jul-21 03:55 PM] Plupsnup#9685
how much of the total real estate's share is land value


[23-Jul-21 03:55 PM] Cam T#6441
I don’t no wat u mean


[23-Jul-21 03:55 PM] Cam T#6441
Like wat the land is worth not the house


[23-Jul-21 03:56 PM] Plupsnup#9685

But for ppl who r poorer, it could b a problem.


[23-Jul-21 03:58 PM] Cam T#6441
Which would b fixed, if we made the house u live in, lvt free.


[23-Jul-21 03:58 PM] Cam T#6441

There wouldn't be any more poor people anyway, 0 poverty no longer as businesses are foirced to look for more hands, bringing up wages and guaranteeing full employment


[23-Jul-21 04:01 PM] Cam T#6441
It would force ppl to buy cheaper houses away from where they r, from their family and friends. Who they probs rely on more


[23-Jul-21 04:02 PM] Cam T#6441

It encourages businesses to be more productive, they would hire more hands and invest in more capital to be more productive, creating new jobs and the economy would be at full employment

businesses would have to pay more in tax as the rent of the land increases in value, encouraging them to be more productive

But retirees aren’t businesses


[23-Jul-21 04:12 PM] дётrivøre#5054
And rent could rise by improvements on the land rather than unimproved value so it doesn’t even make sense to tax in relation to rent

[23-Jul-21 06:47 PM] Cam T#6441
Ur then thing will cost more Cauz businesses will hav more things to pay so their prices for the things in their shop will go up


[23-Jul-21 07:02 PM] doctor#0002
plups are you alright


[23-Jul-21 07:03 PM] doctor#0002
do you really think that if business costs go up, businesses will hire more people?


[23-Jul-21 07:07 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Things wouldn't cost more because investment drives down costs of goods and services


[23-Jul-21 07:08 PM] Cam T#6441
Investment of wat tho


[23-Jul-21 07:08 PM] Cam T#6441
Businesses are paying for tax


[23-Jul-21 07:08 PM] Cam T#6441
So the cost of wat they charge for things will go up


[23-Jul-21 07:18 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Investment in capital to increase productivity


[23-Jul-21 07:24 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Interest and wages earned from businesses would grow at a faster rate than the rate that land rent takes to increase. In absolute terms rent increases as productivity does, but in relative terms rents' share of the economy decreases compared to interest and wages earned by capital and labour which increase at a greater rate

In microeconomic terms businesses would make a far faster growing  income growing at a faster rate than rents' share of costs go


[23-Jul-21 07:29 PM] doctor#0002
go costs of share rents' than rate faster a at growing income growing faster far a make would businesses terms microeconomic In

[23-Jul-21 08:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Plups its only better right now because interest is low


[23-Jul-21 08:37 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
if interest rates go up then lvt rises


[24-Jul-21 07:13 AM] Plupsnup#9685
I'm referring to the Georgist definition of interest,
Interest = return to capital
rent = return to land
wage = return to labour

Cauz they hav saved for it


[24-Jul-21 02:46 PM] Cam T#6441

Did you split the value of your home between you and the other working occupants?

[24-Jul-21 02:55 PM] Cam T#6441

[24-Jul-21 02:55 PM] Cam T#6441

[24-Jul-21 02:55 PM] Cam T#6441

You don’t need to punish ppl for owning a house tho


[24-Jul-21 02:56 PM] Cam T#6441

[24-Jul-21 02:57 PM] Plupsnup#9685

[24-Jul-21 02:57 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Owning a house would be easier


[24-Jul-21 02:57 PM] Cam T#6441

[24-Jul-21 02:57 PM] Cam T#6441

[24-Jul-21 02:57 PM] Cam T#6441

[24-Jul-21 02:57 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Why would you be kicked out?


[24-Jul-21 02:58 PM] Cam T#6441
What happens when u don’t pay the tax


[24-Jul-21 02:58 PM] Plupsnup#9685
And there would be no more poverty


[24-Jul-21 02:58 PM] Cam T#6441
What happens when you don’t pay the tax


[24-Jul-21 02:58 PM] Cam T#6441
If nothing happens and you can just stay there, then that’s fine. But then also probs lots of ppl whould just not pay it


[24-Jul-21 03:00 PM] Plupsnup#9685
There can be public housing as well poor people having the chance to form Community Land Trusts to shift the burden from a individual one to a collective one


[24-Jul-21 03:01 PM] Plupsnup#9685
CLTs are like how Retirement Villages work, a syndicate of homeowners pool in their income to meet the tax base


[24-Jul-21 03:04 PM] Plupsnup#9685
So if there is a group of five homeowners, one two upper-middle class ones and three working class owners, the upper-middle class owners would pool in more income than average to support the working class homeowners so the burden is equalised

If GST was abolished wouldn't businesses keep prices the same and just pocket what they save themselves


[24-Jul-21 03:50 PM] Plupsnup#9685
likely not as firms would realise that they can lower prices with no cost to undercut their competition

[24-Jul-21 03:54 PM] Plupsnup#9685
true


[24-Jul-21 03:55 PM] Plupsnup#9685
but LVT would break up monopoly, because land monopoly is the mother of all monopolies


[24-Jul-21 03:57 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Not a chance of having monopolies broken up by LVT. Delusional if you actually think that. Also, someone has to end up paying more tax under LVT. You keep talking about how much everyone will save while LVT brings in more money. Someone has to be paying more


[24-Jul-21 03:57 PM] Plupsnup#9685
people who own more valuable land would pay more


[24-Jul-21 04:29 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Land monopolists and land bankers would be paying more


[24-Jul-21 04:31 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I keep using the word "monopoly" but I don't think you understand it. We don't have a land monopoly here in Australia neither in value or land area terms


[24-Jul-21 04:32 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Closest you might get to is a land oligopoly

You don't think firms to cut prices to undercut competition?

Maybe eventually, more likely they would just delay putting prices up for a little bit


[24-Jul-21 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Of course but they don't drop prices because the tax isn't there


[24-Jul-21 08:10 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Maybe, but investment into more production would bring prices down

Tony Abbott says he wouldn’t sign a China trade deal again
As prime minister, Abbott struck the China-Australia free trade deal in 2014 and lauded it as one of his government’s biggest achievements in office.

Agree with the sentiment and I don't like the final stage, but do remember the lower incomes did get their tax cuts in the first stages so this one was never intended to change things much at the lower end as they already got theirs

In 2016 QLD passed a law that allows property owners to seek compensation if planning rules reduce development yields.

Yet if planning rules increase development yields and property value, landowners get that for free.

A very lopsided law this one.

Thank You From a Land Speculator
Land is the most important resource a community has. But the property tax system in most U.S. cities encourages the wasteful and unproductive use of land. By taxing building improvements, we punish people who improve their property with higher taxes—and we reward speculators, who can afford to sit on a vacant or underutilized lot in a prime loca...

No private property should be exempt, and the tax should be levied at the national level

but why


[04-Aug-21 12:03 PM] NGSpy#8096
the states need more funding from it


[04-Aug-21 12:03 PM] NGSpy#8096
the federal government is fine with its money


[04-Aug-21 12:09 PM] Plupsnup#9685
States would be getting more funding, 35% of revenue of the rental value of land within it's borders.
It's a much fairer approach than the redistribution of the GST under the current tax regime which some states receive a lesser proportion than they give


[04-Aug-21 12:10 PM] Plupsnup#9685
LVT as the Single Tax would raise more in revenue than the current tax system


[04-Aug-21 12:11 PM] NGSpy#8096
that's based on a calculation that the total land value of Australia is half the wealth of Australia or something right


[04-Aug-21 12:13 PM] Plupsnup#9685
The tax base would rise to a value that is currently 50% of GDP, conservative estimates not taking in the fact that GDP would rise at a faster rate

i still find Land Value Tax quite inequitable in many circumstances, as there are certainly other ways of getting rich without owning properties. Capital Gains in stocks are one way. It also presumes that every rich person owns a plot of land, when there are people who are renters who exist, so it wouldn't tax them, or just tax them implicitly.


[04-Aug-21 01:08 PM] Plupsnup#9685
You would save more than your currently pay in taxes

That money the wealthy aren’t spending is often parked unproductively in land ownership
An LVT eliminates the ability of land to act as such a store of value
The wealthy  will have to at the very least invest their money in stuff that’s actually productive
The wealthy don’t have literal Scrooge McDuck vaults full of gold coins they like to take swims in
They invest their money in stuff. If they invest in things like factories, that’s good for the economy and we don’t want to discourage that
But often they invest their money in buying land as an investment. That’s not so good for the economy, because the money just sits there doing nothing, and worse — drives up the price of land (and thus land rents)
An LVT puts an end to that. Land ends up with a resale value of zero so it can’t act as an investment anymore, and land rents go down because all the speculative investment goes away
And all that money the wealthy would otherwise be investing in land has to be used for something else, something more productive

RBA governor Philip Lowe a month ago noted immigration as a factor in slow wages growth. Now research by the bank shows why he made the comments.

Comments by the RBA linking high immigration to low wage growth are clarified in internal research obtained by Business Insider Australia.

Circulus (theory)
Circulus was a socioeconomics doctrine devised by nineteenth-century French utopian socialist Pierre Leroux (1797–1871), who proposed that human excrement be collected by the state in the form of a tax and used as fertiliser, thereby increasing agricultural production sufficiently to prevent Malthusian catastrophe.

If we averaged each peak growth percentage of GDP since 1972 (4.8%) and modelled growth again using this peak, with the same population of almost 25M, Australia would have had around a GDP of $2,76T in 2018, making a GDP per capita of around $110k

The Reserve Bank has argued migration levels have put downward pressure on wages. Now a senior Treasury official says there is no evidence for the claim.

on point, immigration overall has a positive impact on long term economic growth. with wages at the low-skill immigration end, very specific subgroups like native-born workers without a high school diploma may have very small negative wage implications but overall the net gain is immense :PepeThink:


[08-Sep-21 09:26 AM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yeah basic economics might logically state that, advanced economics is not just viewing it as a supply/demand issue and viewing it within the wider context of Labour economics and actual wider economic impact and not solely quantifying it in wages

Years of ultra-loose fiscal and monetary policies have put the global economy on track for a slow-motion train wreck in the coming years. When the crash comes, the stagflation of the 1970s will be combined with the spiraling debt crises of the post-2008 era, leaving major central banks in an impossible position.

There's no denying the data: Rent control works
Rent control, while not a cure-all for the housing crisis, is a key component of any serious program to address the high cost of living.

[28-Sep-21 12:54 PM] NGSpy#8096
> A 2007 study by Gilderbloom and Ye of more recent rent control laws here in New Jersey finds evidence that rent controls actually increase the supply of rental housing, by incentivizing landlords to subdivide larger rental units.

> A 2015 study by Ambrosius, Glderbloom and coauthors also looks at changes in New Jersey rent regulations. As with the previous study, they find that rent control in New Jersey has not produced any detectable reduction in new housing supply. However, they also find that many of these laws,  because of their relatively generous provisions, in particular vacancy decontrol, only limit rent increases on a relatively small number of housing units


[28-Sep-21 12:58 PM] NGSpy#8096
also it doesnt stop new housing being supplied. theres no link between housing supply decreasing and an imposition of rent control. the decrease in the supply of rental units and their link to rent control is even questionable, as it depends from regulation to regulation.

id not with appreciation that different rent control law regulations can generate different outcomes, but the positives of rent control have been quite consistent across studies done recently on it, and the negative impacts can be traced to policy choice

Price controls cause shortages, this is elementary economics


[28-Sep-21 03:46 PM] NGSpy#8096
mhmm yeah how does elementary economics play in when empiric evidence basically suggest that there are other factors that play into the supply of rental units with this price control.
Rent control is not usually a flat price control, its a flat cap on the rate of increasing rents, so it doesn't function like it usually depicts on an S&D graph.
Also, the models of econ rely on the principle of ceteris paribus, which is severely limited in the context of rent control due to there usually being a lot of law changes to properly enforce Rent control.

I'd consider the fact that rent controlled-apartment's values going down as a good thing, because housing is debate-ably very expensive.
On the consideration of regulated apartments' supply going down, isn't the point of the policy to maintain tenants who are living there? Is that not an intended consequence of the move? More people stay put, communities last longer, civic participation increases and that's a bad thing?

I think its just fundamentally idiotic and close minded to dismiss the policy as completely bloody pointless because its shown good results in places like New Jersey and New York.

AFAIK, it’s just supply overall and not offerings, so the absolute number of units available and in use combined is lower. Prices going down might just be cooling a bubble but it could also reduce quality and certainly reduces the incentive to build more.


[28-Sep-21 04:10 PM] NGSpy#8096
The study Diamond Et Al. actually showed that rent control in San Francisco increased the quality and repair of the homes effected, and a study at Minnesota(?) which looked at the removal of rent control showed there was no increase in the building of houses, showing that there wasn't anything clamping it down.

> we find rent control limits renters' mobility by 20 percent and lowers displacement from San Francisco. Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15 percent by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law.

@Plupsnup what is capitalisation supposed to mean in this circumstance


[01-Oct-21 05:30 PM] Plupsnup#9685
rent transferring into price


[01-Oct-21 05:30 PM] NGSpy#8096
is this economic rent of the land?


[01-Oct-21 05:32 PM] NGSpy#8096
so basically its saying that there will be an effect whereby if the land value tax rises, the property value decreases and if the land value tax lowers, the property value increases.


[01-Oct-21 05:34 PM] NGSpy#8096
> It is plausible that lower property prices following an increase in taxes lead to lower land value assessments.
?????? so basically its saying that the lower property prices are due to a lower land value assessment, which essentially means you get less in tax... wtf


[01-Oct-21 05:35 PM] Plupsnup#9685
That is possible but isn't wanted


[01-Oct-21 05:41 PM] NGSpy#8096
> At the same time, however, full capitalization of land taxes implies that the owner of a land plot at the time of the announcement of a permanent land tax change bears the whole burden of the tax change in present value terms. Hence, land tax changes may have large redistributive implications, implying a requirement to impose such changes, when desired, rather incrementally.
Basically this just concludes that you shouldn't be hasty with raising the LVT to 100%, otherwise it may create unintended consequences.


[01-Oct-21 05:41 PM] NGSpy#8096
Also it relies on the assumption that the owner of land will bear the whole burden of the tax change.


[01-Oct-21 05:42 PM] Plupsnup#9685
which they do


[01-Oct-21 05:43 PM] NGSpy#8096
This is a problem with a flat rate across all of a State of Australia because effectively there is no competition for a place that has no taxation or a higher taxation rate, and thus there could be a situation where land owners just unilaterally decide to raise their prices in proportion to the tax and make renters of the rented land suffer. It's not a completely fool proof plan.


[01-Oct-21 05:43 PM] NGSpy#8096
What I am taking away at this point is that


[01-Oct-21 05:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
LVT is good if you do it on a local government level where the changes are planned and they are notified to the community beforehand


[01-Oct-21 05:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
and its done incrimentally


[01-Oct-21 05:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
otherwise it is uncertain


[01-Oct-21 05:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
You can't guarantee that, whatsoever. People and corporations are irrational.


[01-Oct-21 05:48 PM] Plupsnup#9685
Have the interest value of improvements assessed, then deduct that from gross income from the property, what's leftover is taxed
Landlords won't raise rent unilaterally if the increase is taxed away, they would only increase their net income by improving their property


[01-Oct-21 05:52 PM] NGSpy#8096
If landlords won't raise rent unilaterally if the increase is taxed away, then why do shop owners increase their prices after a value added tax is implemented?


[01-Oct-21 05:57 PM] Plupsnup#9685
supply of goods and services is much more elastic than land, the latter which is inelastic


[01-Oct-21 05:57 PM] Plupsnup#9685
elastic supply = costs can be passed on


[01-Oct-21 06:09 PM] NGSpy#8096
inelastic goods means that if the costs are raised the number of consumers whod want it would not be terribly much, therefore actually allowing for *more* of a price increase


[01-Oct-21 06:10 PM] Plupsnup#9685
what?


[01-Oct-21 06:10 PM] Plupsnup#9685
reducing demand on inelastic supply reduces the good's price, not increase it


[01-Oct-21 06:11 PM] Plupsnup#9685
LVT works by also getting rid of speculative demand for land


[01-Oct-21 06:45 PM] NGSpy#8096
no, with a price inelastic demand good, if you increase the price, the quantity demanded will only decrease slightly compared to an elastic good


[01-Oct-21 06:46 PM] NGSpy#8096

[01-Oct-21 06:52 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I'd argue that the residential side is more elastic. It's commercial and industrial that would be more inelastic as they are more likely to require more specific locations/sizes etc

[28-Oct-21 11:19 PM] doctor#0002
probably the most basic is that if interest rates increase, then people earn more interest on their bank savings, and have to pay more interest on their bank loans, so they are more likely to save and less likely to spend, which obviously slows the economy and slows inflation

[01-Nov-21 05:53 PM] NGSpy#8096
Kids should be getting 8-10 hours of sleep


[01-Nov-21 05:53 PM] дётrivøre#5054
You say that like anyone would agree to a 13 hour shift


[01-Nov-21 05:54 PM] дётrivøre#5054
This just allows the shift to end later


[01-Nov-21 05:54 PM] дётrivøre#5054

8pm at the max should a kid work


[01-Nov-21 05:54 PM] NGSpy#8096
then they should go home, eat dinner, go to bed


[01-Nov-21 05:55 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860

If kids want to work at whatever hours at a good pay, they should be allowed to


[01-Nov-21 05:56 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I'd work and have worked until 10pm but I wouldn't want to go anywhere later


[01-Nov-21 05:56 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
The problem is you don't really have a choice what hours you work and what shifts you get

[01-Nov-21 05:59 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
My availability hours are as it stands overly broad because I was just filling in a bunch of job application forms and trying to give as broad a time as I could and I had no prior experience


[01-Nov-21 05:59 PM] doctor#0002
Can’t you change it


[01-Nov-21 06:00 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I can yeah I just haven't really had the chance to yet nor have I really been allocated excessively difficult shifts


[01-Nov-21 06:00 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I had a point here but I feel like I've gotten off path

[01-Nov-21 06:09 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
wages should probably be higher


[01-Nov-21 06:10 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Like I definitely am half as useful because I'm a trainee but a lot of the kids I work with do work really hard

[01-Nov-21 06:12 PM] jüri_ratas_shill#4849

"wow, countdown really made no effort to distinguish itself from its australian owner"

[01-Nov-21 06:50 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
you're not employing someone under 18 to work the fryer because it's just more expensive

Kmart, and other retailers definitely do not hire over 18s

I still kinda dislike LMIO a lot, just because it’s managed it a pretty poor way, and the offset also like increased until about $90,000 annually. But it is better than Stage 3, I’ll give you that much. idk it just seems like one of those zombie policies that deserved to die but nobody has the political capital to kill.

not as cringe as their other vids, model structure is ofc a major factor in prediction


[17-Nov-21 09:58 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
krugman's oped pieces can be hit and miss but the one UE references is pretty good and introspective, previously underestimating the impact of globalisation on specific sectors is a given although clouded by other factors like automation

while free trade is a win-win at a macro level, there are losers at the individual level which is where utilising the efficiency gains into retraining and assistance (should) take place :pepeMathHmmm:

ohhhhhhhhhh that shellnut
he uses empirical analysis to draw on some positives is all 😌


[17-Nov-21 11:36 AM] NGSpy#8096
iirc UE is more in favour of using land value taxes to solve housing and is mainly just presenting empirical examples relating to rent control showing that Econ 101 is bs


[17-Nov-21 11:40 AM] NGSpy#8096
this was shown in his Economics vs Breadtube video against Philosophy Tube


[17-Nov-21 11:41 AM] NGSpy#8096
I think that honestly Heterodox Economics should be encouraged more to counter mainstream economic thoughts because well, there are a lot of problems with both schools that need to be debated.


[17-Nov-21 11:41 AM] NGSpy#8096
hence looking at empirics instead of just theory is neet

[17-Nov-21 12:06 PM] NGSpy#8096
I had a read of the abstract of the Diamond et al. paper and all I got was that 'rent control effects more specifically are very dependent upon the regulations imposed'


[17-Nov-21 12:09 PM] NGSpy#8096
oh and i think the positive spillovers of more stable communities are underestimated


[17-Nov-21 12:10 PM] NGSpy#8096
it really just depends on what you want fundamentally. if you want people to stay and gentrification then rent control seems to be quite good at that if you write the regulation properly


[17-Nov-21 12:15 PM] NGSpy#8096
overall public housing and LVT is probably the better option if governments commit to it


[17-Nov-21 12:19 PM] NGSpy#8096
I'd probably have to read it a lot more thoroughly than get the 'rent control bad duh' and 'rent control good duh' to make a more finalised opinionated take

[24-Nov-21 07:39 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Australia is a relatively small country. My city has a population of 150,000. If you take the vague Metropolitan area into account it's the 7th largest city in the country at a population of 500,000 and the 2nd largest non-capital. The region my city serves is the largest non-capital economic region in the country. It's one of the best places to live and work in the country...but that means fuck all if wage growth doesn't move at all. And wage growth is the same across the country, as are overinflated housing prices. I could move and risk losing 2 jobs that I have no guarantee of getting again elsewhere or even at better wages while also taking on the cost risk of moving (I can't afford a house anywhere in the country due to overinflated housing prices) because I'd have to rent (which is also overinflated) which makes it even more difficult to save and I wouldn't have any friends or family to help if I struggle (because I moved away from them all). If I'm working close to 60 hours a week to save for a house deposit and housing prices are rising more in a week than I earn working 240 hours before tax even comes into account, then I think you severely underestimate how fucked the system is.

There is no labour shortage, just a properly paid job shortage
When bad employers say they cannot find workers what they mean is they are not prepared to change their business model and raise wages.

Why the Netherlands is the Best Country for Drivers
The Netherlands is famous for bicycles, and putting walking, cycling, and public transit ahead of cars. Yet paradoxically, it's the best place in the world to be a driver.

This video explores why it's so great to drive in the Netherlands.

I mean, it depends on what coin you're talking about. BTC strictly speaking is not encryption based, rather relies on elliptic curve cryptography for public-private keys


[25-Nov-21 01:01 PM] NGSpy#8096
interesting. there is still the possibility of a completely encrypted currency which allows for authorities to have no fucking clue who gave and received in a transaction ain't it?


[25-Nov-21 01:06 PM] Darkpulsar#2512
Other privacycoins like XMR are more complicated, obfuscating more details about transactions as a feature (though there is supposedly tracing capabilities developed by firms like ciphertrace but stuff like this isn't public)

> Unlike a natural gas plant, solar plant operators can’t easily throttle electricity up and down as needed, or space generation out through the day, night and dark winter. It’s available when it’s available, which is when the sun is shining. And that’s when all the other solar plants are cranking out electricity at maximum levels as well.


[04-Dec-21 03:33 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
It's available when it's available is exactly why it's so efficient. You're not burning excess energy just to keep a generator online even when no-one needs it :agony:. The mixed use of numerous renewable sources will mostly cover gaps. It'll be incredibly unlikely that there'll be no sunlight, no wind, no rivers flowing, no waves moving and no biomass fuel to burn all at the same time and even more unlikely that there's no battery capacity at the same time. It's not impossible which is why I agree with having at least one nuclear reactor in Australia until future technologies enable us to power entirely through renewables or we achieve nuclear fusion.

I don’t see the connection between rent control and the scarcity in housing. You could take away the rent control and they’d still have an extreme lack of housing.


[09-Dec-21 01:25 AM] Perekai#6805
Like you can still have rent control *and* provide housing, either through building public housing, or encouraging private development by exempting new rentals.


[09-Dec-21 01:27 AM] Perekai#6805

modern rent controls that exempt new construction are marginally better but also suffer by inherently encouraging old stock conversion, usually to higher end, owner-occupier models further supressing supply

or otherwise disincentives old rental stock maintenance through the reduction of revenue

and people still think rent control is good :agony:


[09-Dec-21 02:28 AM] Perekai#6805
This doesn’t make sense. If you can’t improve the dwelling any further without pushing it’s value above the rent ceiling, then it’s probably fairly well developed already. Unless you’re saying it can’t be maintained, which wouldn’t be possible as that would require the ceiling to be way *way* below anything reasonable.


[09-Dec-21 02:30 AM] Perekai#6805
Old stock conversion is fine. Encouraging housing for ownership rather than renting is potentially positive. There’s no doubt that supply would be restricted slightly, but that’s why you’re incentivising private development in the first place.


[09-Dec-21 02:33 AM] Perekai#6805
Also, you can implement a method of allowing rents to increase if you renovate the dwelling. Sweden has this as a part of their regulations.


[09-Dec-21 07:18 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
In Sweden landlords can only raise rents for large 'quality of life' increasing renovations, incentivising higher end devleopment on one end while regular maintenance of lower quality stock suffers due to low rent yields

(September 2019) - Using a 1994 law change, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in the assignment of rent control in San Francisco to study its impacts on tenants and landlords. Leveraging new data tracking individuals' migration, we find rent control limits renters' mobility by 20 percent and lowers displacement from San Francisco. Landlord...

[09-Dec-21 07:30 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
> Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15 percent by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law.


[09-Dec-21 11:00 AM] Perekai#6805
Except that the 15 percent reduction in rent controlled units is made up of 8% owners moving into their rentals and 7%  living in non-rent controlled housing. 

> The previous section shows that rent control incentivized landlords to substitute away from an older rental housing stock toward new construction rentals and owner-occupied condos. Combining our estimates of rent control’s effect on the number of owner occupants (8.1 percent) and renters liv- ing in rent control exempt housing (7.2 percent) suggests that 15.3 percent of the treated properties engaged in renovations to evade rent control.


[09-Dec-21 11:02 AM] Perekai#6805
Also this shows that while it may constrict the housing market (which is expected), it does increase quality of housing. Though it’s misleading because the lowering on rent-controlled tenants is correlated with apartments leaving rent control by being renovated.

[09-Dec-21 11:03 AM] Perekai#6805
But frankly this doesn’t even put forward an argument against rent control, simply an investigation against San Francisco’s specific policy on renovations.


[09-Dec-21 11:05 AM] Perekai#6805
That’s not a problem with rent control, as the incentive to build new developments and the government building new public housing should still be there. I still fail to see how rent control has caused this issue in Sweden, beyond that it has slightly constricted the market that they have already left languishing with barely any new development.


[09-Dec-21 11:18 AM] NGSpy#8096
Yeah. I think the consequences vary depending upon the specific exemptions and the policy implemented. Its not *rent control* that does it, its the consequential policy that is implemented individually with it

[10-Dec-21 01:31 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
rent control plays a huge role but not the only component to constrain housing supply (zoning, building permits, etc). there are ofc winners under rent control, incumbent residents, and in the short run equality but come at the cost of long term market distortion


[10-Dec-21 01:33 AM] Perekai#6805
Yeah, you’d need to replace the newly improved domiciles with either new private development or public housing. Nothing wrong with gentrification either if it’s private developers improving property so that higher income renters can move in a lower income neighbourhood. It’s not as if all owners in an area are simultaneously developing at the same time to evict poorer residents. At least that shouldn’t happen if you implement policy to prevent evictions by renovation.


[10-Dec-21 01:36 AM] Perekai#6805
I don’t see an issue with long run market distortion. We currently have market distortion by extremely overpriced housing and rent created by artificial scarcity, property being used as an investment, and widening income inequality.


[10-Dec-21 01:39 AM] Perekai#6805
Rent control does work if it is implemented correctly, like any policy. It’s foolish to say that Sweden’s housing crisis is the fault of rent controls, and not a severe housing shortage. Perhaps it exacerbates it, but the solution isn’t getting rid of rent control - it’s building more homes.


[10-Dec-21 01:51 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
it's definitely a complex area fraught with other large distortionary policies, particularly land use regulations and local permits which often further hamper housing supply

Danish and Swedish socialists fight against minimum wage directive
The minimum wage directive is a key policy goal for European Social Democrats, but leftist parties and trade unions in Denmark and Sweden see it as a danger for their labour market model. They have collected enough signatures to force a vote in November’s European Parliament plenary, potentially delaying the directive for months.

> The Danish and the Swedish labour markets are almost exclusively organised around collective bargaining. Trade unions and employers negotiate working conditions directly with each other with close to no involvement of the state.

Okaaay so this looks like it has nothing to do with the economics of a minimum wage, but the political implications of eroding their bargaining powers.


[12-Dec-21 11:36 AM] NGSpy#8096

[12-Dec-21 11:36 AM] Perekai#6805
So, two specific left wing political parties oppose minimum wage because they believe they have something better? That’s hardly economic opposition.


[12-Dec-21 11:39 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
it's all politics but rather an interesting quirk of the nordic labour model where minimum wages are largely anathema


[12-Dec-21 11:39 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
no swedish political party supports minimum wages afaik, i'd suspect denmark is largely the same


[12-Dec-21 11:40 AM] Perekai#6805
If you have collective bargaining and it works, you don’t need a minimum wage, so I don’t know why they would.


[12-Dec-21 11:46 AM] NGSpy#8096
The minimum wage is only put in place to prevent businesses from exploiting their workers. if the workers feel that is not needed and that collective bargaining has their proper infrastructure then I see no problem with yeeting it.


[12-Dec-21 11:59 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
the collective bargaining model in Sweden is certainly interesting with the national Employer's confederation also supporters of the system (and against minimum wages)


[12-Dec-21 12:00 PM] Darkpulsar#2512
90% of workers in Sweden are under a collective agreement, though another interesting thing is that pay rises are usually individually negotiated


[12-Dec-21 12:08 PM] Perekai#6805

So with this bill, NZ has:

- no more single family zoning
- no more parking requirements
- no more min. lot sizes
- 3 stories everywhere
- 6 stories near major transit & job centres

This is one of the most significant housing bills passed anywhere in the English speaking world https://t.co/CREBbBpXpf

Labor will ask super funds what changes need to be made to get them to put more of their members’ money into infrastructure.

[15-Dec-21 09:17 PM] doctor#0002
Why is this a bad thing


[15-Dec-21 09:17 PM] doctor#0002
Is it because it will remove from wages


[15-Dec-21 09:17 PM] doctor#0002
Or just because super bad


[15-Dec-21 09:18 PM] mikiboss#2416
Well first question, where do you think Super comes from?


[15-Dec-21 09:18 PM] doctor#0002
Wages


[15-Dec-21 09:19 PM] mikiboss#2416
Well yeah there you go, for a lot of people, if there isn't an increase in real wages, in the short term super acts as a paycut in the short term.


[15-Dec-21 09:20 PM] mikiboss#2416
But yes I dislike Super for a lot of things. Bad for the budget bottom line because the tax concessions are insane, SMSF are like ridiculous in the wealth that they hold, and I think that $30b in fees is a bit much,


[15-Dec-21 09:22 PM] doctor#0002
so what is the alternative


[15-Dec-21 09:22 PM] doctor#0002
pension?


[15-Dec-21 10:00 PM] mikiboss#2416
Ideally, yes. Pension while having superannuation assets become a sovereign wealth fund


[15-Dec-21 10:24 PM] doctor#0002
sounds like communism ?


[15-Dec-21 11:33 PM] BloodyChrome#8410
Hmm is the ALP not wanting super to increase?


[15-Dec-21 11:33 PM] BloodyChrome#8410
A better return than elsewhere. I'd hope they aren't forced to make less money


[15-Dec-21 11:34 PM] BloodyChrome#8410
Also sounds like being on poverty line relying on the state. Which won't hurt the wealthy just the middle classes


[16-Dec-21 12:00 AM] mikiboss#2416
Nah 
> Labor is attempting to make the Coalition’s commitment to higher superannuation an issue at the upcoming federal election, due next year.
> 
> Labor’s financial services spokesman Stephen Jones told the event that “the 12 per cent issue will be in contest as it was in contest at the last election”.
> 
> Pointing out that the increase to 12 per cent was legislated was not good enough, he said.
> 
> “It was legislated in 2012-13 as well, and then it was frozen for the best part of a decade.”
Labor's also committed in the past to actually raising Super to 15%


[16-Dec-21 12:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
What's the ceiling


[16-Dec-21 12:09 AM] mikiboss#2416
I think 15% would basically be the roof of how high it would go, at least in terms of what Labor is forecasting, given that is what Keating himself says he wanted it to hit


[16-Dec-21 12:16 AM] BloodyChrome#8410
Hmm interesting


[16-Dec-21 12:36 AM] doctor#0002
20% super


[16-Dec-21 12:38 AM] BloodyChrome#8410
20% of your wage to super 32% to tax, leaves you with even less.


[16-Dec-21 12:38 AM] BloodyChrome#8410

There are some moral grounds I have for a basic income as well which unfortunately cannot be measured without an actual proper implementation of it.
Most of discussion about it is very lopsided to just 'if u implement the basic income bad things happen duh'
there'd obviously need to be major changes to markets (especially housing) in order for it to work well

yeah I mean Fuel Prices are pretty steep here compares to the US, we do pay quite a bit in the Fuel Tax (which I kinda am annoyed at how it works, road user charges are more effective, and the charge is mostly exempt for bigger firms like mining) but a lot of our prices are due to more natural reasons

The main fuel tax in Australia is an excise tax, to which is added a Goods and Services Tax ("GST"). Both taxes are levied by the federal government. In Australia, like Canada, the GST (in Australia's case of 10%) is applied on top of the fuel excise tax. In some cases, businesses may be entitled to exemptions or rebates for fuel excise tax, inc...

Sub meltdown and they release a now deleted statement addressing things, including that the mod prepared for the Jessie interview by showering :agony:


[28-Jan-22 08:03 AM] Darkpulsar#2512
And also admitted that another mod, "a 21 year old male, long-term unemployed anarchist", has also done media interviews lmao

He did really look like a Reddit mod lol


[28-Jan-22 11:19 AM] NGSpy#8096
antiwork was fine as a subreddit until this shit blew up lmao


[28-Jan-22 06:11 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
^


[28-Jan-22 06:13 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Anti-work was actually a really good subreddit. I'm sure it's helped lots of people realise that they are in unhealthy work/life balances, are being exploited for their labour, have shit bosses, aren't getting paid enough, are working too much, etc and helped lots more people avoid employment like this by recognising the red flags beforehand


[28-Jan-22 06:15 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
The fact that it quickly became the largest subreddit on reddit is a testament that a lot of people are being exploited by their workplaces and are suddenly finding a place with lots of people, with similar stories, and understanding that they are, in fact, being wronged


[28-Jan-22 06:19 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And it's extremely dangerous for people to now be getting this idea that all these people sharing stories of labour exploitation and how to avoid it are "lazy" or "unproductive." Most stories are of people leaving torturous workplaces to find better jobs with fairer pay and conditions and the main sentiment is that, if you are being exploited by your workplace and they won't meet your fair demands, you can leave for better jobs.


[28-Jan-22 06:20 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Your life shouldn't be centred around work, work should be centred around your life


[28-Jan-22 06:41 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And it's actually quite disrespectful to treat someone as lesser just because of the work they do. Dog walking is a job that needs to be done, why does it matter if someone is happy to do that work and get paid fairly for it. No-one should be disrespected because of a job they choose to do...even mincers who get paid millions to sit on their ass and talk shit in front of a camera


[28-Jan-22 06:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
I think it was a mistake though for the moderator to even be on that interview


[28-Jan-22 06:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
that was an accident waiting to happen


[28-Jan-22 06:50 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Yeah, I’m truly confused what they expected would happen with an interview on Fox


[28-Jan-22 06:53 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Oh for sure, he absolutely should've denied their request


[28-Jan-22 06:55 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
But he didn't, and Fox achieved their ultimate goal of keeping people blind to labour exploitation by bringing down a movement for fair work


[28-Jan-22 06:55 PM] дётrivøre#5054
I don’t think Fox News thinks that far in advance


[28-Jan-22 06:56 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Their hosts share five IQ points throughout the day


[28-Jan-22 06:56 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Jokes aside, they probably just reacted negatively because it’s something new for them


[28-Jan-22 06:56 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Owning a redditor on live TV is about as easy as remembering to breathe every day


[28-Jan-22 06:57 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Conservatives instinctively dislike anything different or new


[28-Jan-22 06:57 PM] дётrivøre#5054
So they probably have not thought about it much outside of “weird new online thing”


[28-Jan-22 06:58 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
If a movement can be brought down by an interview on Fox News it was never much of an movement lmfao

Because their viewpoint is that it's just outsourcing to underpaid overseas workers and that the company's reason is bullshit when Australia clearly has a large talent pool that they're just too stingy to pay for

Oh it's absolutely racist but it does get the point across in a very blunt way. I assume these people know that there are highly skilled professionals in these countries but these are also countries with wages much lower than Australia's. It's obviously a shit outsourcing ploy

The trusty no true Scotsman


[20-Feb-22 02:32 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
If anything, this article tells me that early education should have funding heavily increased to provide crucially beneficial learning spaces where children can naturally develop critical skills regardless of family means, race, etc.

If throwing money at a problem doesn’t work, just throw more money at it


[20-Feb-22 02:39 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
This article clearly alludes to under-funding of early ed. A well funded centre (such as those paid for by wealthier families) can provide a well-designed space, with good quality teachers and allow kids to develop their brains without too much interference. On the other hand, this article shows that under-funded centres that cater to low means families (who otherwise wouldn't have been able to send their kids to early ed) and are standardised across too wide of an area with lack of trained expertise in early ed (because the teachers are paid less) has a detrimental effect on child development.
The common factor here is literally poverty. Remove the poverty boundaries from early ed and the children benefit. Remove the poverty boundaries from early ed and the children can grow to become the professionals, technicians, scientists the country needs in the future, benefitting society greatly.
The importance of good early ed is highly underestimated and the effects of bad early ed aren't questioned enough

Just stay away from Econ subreddits. As a discipline it lends itself to be full of this sort of behaviour. As much as some some might try convince themselves, it's not a science. It's a never ending revolving door of argument. If you want to learn more about economics, find some economists and authors you like and read them. Everyone is trying to sell you their slant one way or another.

While letting people off the hook for debt isn't ideal, in the US at least, it is so transparently a cash-cow that has been used to take advantage of a increasingly more technical workforce that requires tertiary study. I mean you can't default on it and you end up paying double what it was worth when you took it out initially.

Regardless of whatever the personal choices of the debtors are, the fact is that it is becoming a drain on the US and is objectively a system set up to extract as much profit from them as possible. So like, you could just complain about people who studied philosophy and can't participate in the economy, or we could just make loans more reasonable and actually get some value out of them.

The money does go back into the pool but the interest is high enough that it causes 11% of borrowers on the current loan program to default.

Yep, unions are so much a government's enemy that they passed basic workers rights and a worker's rights board into law to prevent unions from creating their own power separate from government authority which would have been a risk to the corporate hegemony as the US had just seen happen in Russia just over a decade before. It's easier to control workers unions when you give a guise of basic appeasements and put government authority over them rather than outright oppose them and watch your corporate hegemony crumble and your wealthy cronies get put against firing walls.

Fed raises key rate by a half-point in bid to tame inflation
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark interest rate by a half-percentage point Wednesday — its most aggressive move since 2000 — and signaling further large rate hikes to come.

He’s not, though he’d go a long way about helping the least affluent if he allowed Amazon workers to unionise.


[18-May-22 12:20 AM] Perekai#6805
I don’t think the ire he is drawing here is because he is wrong, it’s because he’s the last person who should be in a position to lecture anyone on the struggles of the poorest in his country.


[18-May-22 12:22 AM] Perekai#6805
Probably doesn’t help that even with large stimulus, it hardly touches the walls when you consider how much of it doesn’t go towards stimulating the economy, it goes to the super profits of companies like Amazon.

3/ The US tax system is MORE progressive than European countries'.
This is because the personal income tax is about as progressive in the US as in Western Europe (and much more progressive than in Eastern Europe), while indirect taxes are much lower.

[11-Jun-22 01:13 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
if WA is saying that inflation will fall, they are delusional


[11-Jun-22 01:13 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
mid next year is when we might have seen some fall (and only down to like 4.5% at best)

PPP GDP per capita

Australia really do be so rich and yet so poor

Taxes are one reason out of many


[12-Jun-22 10:59 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Australia has a very high cost of living


[12-Jun-22 11:00 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Our reliance on imports for many of our goods also makes goods more expensive for the average Australian


[12-Jun-22 11:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
We are poor because Labor are in power


[12-Jun-22 11:02 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Our critical commodities are also highly exported and reflect global prices so Australians are paying global prices for our own commodities


[12-Jun-22 11:02 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
One reflection of this is in the energy market. Your electricity bill is so expensive because the coal and gas generators are buying coal and gas in Australia at global prices :agony:


[12-Jun-22 11:03 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Housing prices and rent is also hyperinflated and would have a severe reflection on this index

It's interesting on this note because if I remember right the ACT has the highest HDI of any subdivision in the world


[12-Jun-22 11:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
With WA ranking 3rd or 4th


[12-Jun-22 11:05 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
HDI doesn't have to match PPP GDP

[12-Jun-22 11:06 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
You can have a great HDI and still not be able to purchase a new tv


[12-Jun-22 11:06 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Alternatively you could have massive purchasing power and still have terrible HDI

Australia is 2nd in nominal GDP


[12-Jun-22 11:08 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
And yet many Australians live in poverty


[12-Jun-22 11:10 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Look at Qatar, it's 12th on that list and yet 45th in HDI (countries only)

The smell around Tesla is getting weirder.

US enquiry to probe suspicions that Tesla’s autopilot is designed to auto-quit when a crash is imminent… so that the driver is liable on the moment of impact - and Tesla’s system escapes scrutiny or bad stats. https://t.co/cO3jNtAveQ

Lol they’ve always been open that it does this


[14-Jun-22 06:38 AM] BHjr132#2979
It’s why it tells you to always hold the wheel and pay attention even when autopilot is on


[14-Jun-22 06:38 AM] BHjr132#2979
I’ve seen videos where it just auto-exits autopilot on a windy road because the camera gets confused and can’t follow the lane lines


[14-Jun-22 06:39 AM] BHjr132#2979
So the car just starts going in a straight line off the side of the road unless you’re ready to steer it immediately

[15-Jun-22 06:34 AM] BHjr132#2979
Inflation will rise to 7% by December and won’t peak until first quarter next year


[15-Jun-22 06:35 AM] BHjr132#2979
Lowe doesn’t predict an interest rate but says it’ll probably get to 2.5% at some point


[15-Jun-22 06:36 AM] BHjr132#2979
They are targeting 2.5% inflation


[15-Jun-22 08:11 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
RBA said in their statement following the 0.5% increase that inflation is being driven by international effects mostly, so all these rises are going to do is make life more expensive at a time of rising inflation, without stopping inflation from rising


[15-Jun-22 08:14 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Yes


[15-Jun-22 08:14 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Philip Lowe is either a moron or he's making money somewhere


[15-Jun-22 08:16 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
The big domestic inflation problem is housing and obviously there's plenty of ways to reduce that problem that don't involve interest rates


[15-Jun-22 08:17 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
And gradual increases (like 0.25% every second month) for the year would send enough signals to the market to take heat out of the housing market


[15-Jun-22 08:18 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Plus tightening loan serviceability requirements


[15-Jun-22 08:18 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Investor loan requirements


[15-Jun-22 08:18 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Etc


[15-Jun-22 08:36 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Overall though prices will continue to increase if supply remains the same and the problem just gets worse


[15-Jun-22 08:38 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
The housing market can't collapse because the government would be forced to save it. So it's in the profiteers best interests to ignore interest rates and keep selling overinflated housing and dodgy loans


[15-Jun-22 09:44 AM] NGSpy#8096
It is in the interest of banks to keep lending dodgy loans because they make money in the end anyway. So yeah unless regulations get tighter on what an acceptable loan is, the situation is fucked


[15-Jun-22 09:48 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Correct


[15-Jun-22 09:49 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
The problem is, if regulations were any tighter, people wouldn't be able to get home loans due to the overinflated housing market


[15-Jun-22 09:50 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
Most home loans now would probably not fit the criteria and yet people need these massive loans so they can have somewhere to live :agony:


[15-Jun-22 12:31 PM] NGSpy#8096
essentially, we're fucked!
until it crashes, then regulations tighten again,
then they loosen until everything is fucked
and bam


[15-Jun-22 12:31 PM] NGSpy#8096
cycle


[15-Jun-22 12:40 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And it can't crash because the government has to bail it out to prevent thousands of people suddenly ending up homeless which just saves the banks causing the problem and incentivises them to keep causing the problem


[15-Jun-22 12:40 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
And all of this could very easily be prevented if the government built more housing


[15-Jun-22 05:46 PM] NGSpy#8096
and kept regulations tight so that people who can't pay back mortgages don't get mortgages that would fuck them over


[15-Jun-22 05:47 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
In a regular market I would agree with you


[15-Jun-22 05:48 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
But in this market there is no choice


[15-Jun-22 05:48 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I'm sure most people getting home loans right now are well aware the banks are fucking them over


[15-Jun-22 05:49 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
But between a home loan screw over, un-secure and extremely expensive renting, and homelessness, I know which I would prefer


[15-Jun-22 05:51 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Tightening market regulations without fixing the root of the problem will just exacerbate the problem by forcing people to rent, only further driving up rental prices and increasing property purchases by investors which, in turn, only further drives up property prices


[15-Jun-22 05:54 PM] NGSpy#8096
that's fair.


[16-Jun-22 12:31 AM] My13InchDuck#1952
The housing market cannot collapse not because the government will save it, the housing market cannot crash because of our immigration policy. We bring in a new 400k people a year, most of whom have families, all of whom need a place to live. This would be bad enough if that policy were for just one year, but that has been the policy for year*s*, and will continue to be. The market cannot collapse because demand is always rising and supply is always falling because we build fewer homes than immigrants arriving

[16-Jun-22 10:39 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
That's the point. Profiteers don't care about housing everyone, they only care about the profits they can make from restricting a basic human necessity


[16-Jun-22 10:39 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
It's not migrants fault Australia doesn't build enough housing


[16-Jun-22 10:41 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
We actually need a large amount of migrants to keep our country running, otherwise Australia would collapse under the pressure of a massively old population and a complete lack of workers


[16-Jun-22 10:42 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
We have the money, resources and labour pool to build enough houses for everyone including Australians and migrants and yet we don't because powerful people want to make more money


[16-Jun-22 10:44 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
The fact that public housing has actually been declining instead of rising tells you everything you need to know

yes migrant workers keep the country running but Australia has the most sustainable demographics out of the main 5 anglo countries


[16-Jun-22 02:21 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
if all migrant temp workers left we would be in a recession for 2-3 years and some industries would collapse but we would be fine


[16-Jun-22 02:23 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
That's only temp workers


[16-Jun-22 02:23 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
I'm talking about migration as a whole


[16-Jun-22 02:26 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Migration of young singles, couples and families is what keeps our population sustainable. They provide immediate entry into the workforce and they often raise families here that keep our population somewhat replenished


[16-Jun-22 02:26 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
If Australia stopped all migration, the effects would be devastating


[16-Jun-22 02:28 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
yeah but we would live


[16-Jun-22 02:28 PM] 12MaxWild#6477
we just need more houses

Apartments are necessary


[16-Jun-22 02:31 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Houses take up far too much valuable land and sprawl means houses cost more in infrastructure than they'll ever produce in value for a city


[16-Jun-22 02:31 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
The more people living close to work, shops, entertainment, transport, parks, etc the better


[16-Jun-22 02:31 PM] 12MaxWild#6477

now you're thinking what I'm thinking


[16-Jun-22 02:55 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Yes, a completely over-worked labour force due to necessitated increased productivity and dual-employment to cover the rising cost of living. You aren't really getting a pay rise, you're just now getting what you should be getting because employers are so desperate for workers they'll actually pay them a fair wage. Labour shortages are also one factor that increases the cost of goods and services only contributing further to the problem. There's many critical industries that won't have the workers it needs regardless of pay due to domestic skills shortages. And the amount of people in retirement each year continually increases while our natural population growth continually decreases


[16-Jun-22 03:45 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
This is the worst take I’ve ever read. This argument supports infinite immigration to support the immigrants you just got as they age which requires you to, again, bring in more immigrants to support the last bunch you just got. This is an abysmal take

I don't agree with infinite immigration. I know that immigration is necessary while natural population growth remains below replacement level. If you want immigration to go down, the best thing to do is to get Australians to fuck. Because the problem is Australians are intentionally not having kids (or they can't). Kids are expensive to raise (especially now), take time out of your work, are mentally stressful and there's little incentive to have kids. The fertility rate is also going down in both genders due to a variety of reasons including pollution and obesity which no-one is realistically trying to reduce.
Infinite immigration is also not a realistic possibility because as developing nations become developed, their rapid population growth slows, stabilises and then consistently declines. By the end of the century, most countries will have reached this stage, reducing the desire for people to migrate to Australia. Australia has to start increasing it's natural population rate now to ensure we aren't fucked when the immigration inevitably stops.

Now you're talking about revenue, not oil prices. Revenue doubling will increase profit, correct. Your costs doubling will not increase profit. The cost of oil doubling (as said here https://discord.com/channels/288977553123966976/761168381259808788/987171866777108500) is not going to double profits. If both your revenues and your costs double and your profit margin remains unchanged, your profits shouldn't change

3. Allowing more competition in the US also wouldn't reduce the global price of oil. Allowing more competition might create competitive pricing to reduce prices domestically but that could only happen if the oil companies were price gouging which according to you they're not.

[17-Jun-22 12:48 PM] дётrivøre#5054
Suppose I buy apples at $5 and then resell so I earn a 3% profit, so at $5.15. If the price of apples rises to $10 and I still have a 3% profit margin, then I’ll be selling at $10.30. My profit will have doubled despite my profit margin being the exact same because the raw material costs have increased.


[17-Jun-22 12:48 PM] дётrivøre#5054
What you think they need is entirely subjective


[17-Jun-22 01:40 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Yes, you are correct. If profit margins remain unchanged then your profits should consequently double if your costs double. I was looking at it backwards and incorrectly ignoring how profit margins work, focusing on the doubling of costs without doubling of revenue (which would change profit margin).

So realistically, all you've pointed out to me are that oil companies are maintaining a high profit margin on doubled costs and they can do this because they are selling a necessary commodity. Oil companies are increasing their sales cost to cover their goods cost but also increasing their sales cost on top of this to maintain their profit margin instead of reducing their profit margin to keep prices lower without affecting their actual profits

Back to your apple example, if you want to make 15c profit off every apple you sell then you should be selling your apples at a 15c mark-up. Selling your apples at a 30c mark-up just to maintain your profit margin at 3% is pure greed, especially when people rely on your apples to survive. Just because your apples went up in price doesn't mean you need to increase your revenue to match. If you keep your apples at 15c mark-up, your profit margin will decrease but your profits will remain unchanged. Selling your $5 apples at $5.15 gives you a 3% profit margin and 0.15c profit on every apple you sell. Selling your $10 apples at $10.15 gives you a 1.5% profit margin but you maintain 0.15c profit on every apple you sell. If you consistently sell 1000 apples a day, you will consistently make $150 profit.

The same is true of oil companies. They could maintain the same mark-up which would keep costs lower and profits the same despite decreasing the profit margin. This actually now explains to me why oil companies purposefully restrict their supply to increase prices; because ultimately, them not drilling oil to increase prices also increases their profits because they don't have to change their profit margins due to selling a necessity


[17-Jun-22 01:42 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Of course, but you're the one complaining about the high prices. Yet you refuse to acknowledge that the oil companies could reduce their profit margins, keeping prices for consumers lower, and still maintain the same profits as they were before global oil prices rose


[17-Jun-22 04:14 PM] дётrivøre#5054
I’m glad we’ve cleared up the profit margin discussion.

Ultimately, it seems your main argument is that you don’t think the companies should maintain their profit margin (I wouldn’t call 3% a high margin BTW). There are reasons for them to do so. They need to satisfy shareholders, for starters. They also need to reinvest in the business. Both of these actions are necessary because they serve the central purpose of a company — to provide shareholder value.

Let’s talk actual numbers. Shell has a net income of $20.6Bn on a revenue of $261.5Bn, meaning their profit margin is roughly 8%. That means they profit about 40¢ on a $5.60 gallon of gas (subtracting 68¢ of federal and state gas taxes). At $3/gallon and a similar profit margin, they would have profited 19¢. For the increase in gas prices by $2.60, they would have had to increase their profit per gallon to $2.79, meaning their profit margin would have risen to 56%. It quite obviously hasn’t.


[17-Jun-22 10:58 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Of course they need to satisfy shareholders. That's exactly why they maximise profits at the expense of everyday people like yourself and then pay media companies to blame the president for it so everyday people like yourself think it's the president's fault they're paying high prices and not the absolute greed of oil companies. I also understand needing to re-invest in the business (although that need has reduced lately due to little need for expansion) but all that does is increase the value of the business, rewarding shareholders again without having to pay tax. And yes, I think it's atrocious for a company to maintain a profit margin that it could reduce (and still make immense profits) while millions of people are struggling to make ends meet as the cost of living and inflation rise and they're reliant on your product to get anywhere due to decades of manipulation in government that saw over-investment in your transport mode while other transport modes were completely under-invested. This is exactly why nationally critical infrastructure and commodities shouldn't be privatised in the first place.

I followed until the last bit which didn't make sense to me at all. Why would they need to increase their profit per gallon to $2.79? If the profit margin is the same on $5.60 and $3 then the profit is exactly what you already stated. Why would jumping from $3 to $5.60 mean a profit increase to $2.79? 

I highly doubt Shell increased their profit margin, I simply view it as unreasonable for them to not massively reduce their profit margin if their revenue is massively increasing. Handing out $5.4B this quarter to shareholders simply because they had wealth to buy a stake in your company at the expense of everyone else who doesn't have that wealth and still relies on your products seems like a gross waste of money. Even sharing all that as employee bonuses would be a better use of that money seeing as they're the ones actually working.

[19-Jun-22 01:39 PM] дётrivøre#5054
My apologies for the late response.

I wouldn't call the maintenance of a given profit margin "maximizing revenue." It's just reasonable business activity. Companies reduce their profit margins when they need to compete — their current profit margins are pretty reasonable (compared to thin profit margins in retail and high profit margins in tech), and limited competition means they likely won't go any lower.

You make some big claims here. Do you have evidence for the claim that oil companies have paid media companies to "blame the president" for gas price increases while themselves hiking profits? (Plus, as we've established, the vast majority of price increases come from increases in the price of crude oil, which is not the fault of oil corporations.)

You also talk about inflation and American car-centered lifestyles. Neither of these are the responsibility or the domain of oil companies. Oil corporations aren't governed to maximize how much tax they pay or how many people get cheap gas. They are governed to provide shareholder value. Road privatization is completely beyond the scope of this argument.

I mentioned the theoretical increase in profit to $2.79/gallon to show how claiming that oil companies' profits accounts for gas price increases doesn't make sense. For profits alone to account for a rise in gas prices from $3 to $5.60, they would have to rise from 19¢ to $2.79 a gallon.

Finally, you talk about how corporations are greedy. As someone who owns some stocks, I don't want the companies whose shares I own to be governed as charities. They are governed to benefit shareholders like me. I wouldn't call that greedy, but rather reasonable — shareholders like me, who provide the capital for these companies to expand their business, ought to be rewarded for the risk they assumed in funding them.

[20-Jun-22 12:47 PM] MR AWESOME#2496
Whether you call it "maximizing revenue" or not is irrelevant; that's still exactly what it is. The problem is, your capitalist system is inherently anti-competition. More oil companies isn't going to reduce prices; the fact that there's a complete oligopoly maintaining higher prices already confirms this. And yes, I established that the increased price of crude oil (maintained by OPEC) is why prices are higher (while you blamed Biden); this doesn't mean oil companies are free from blame for price gouging.

Are you really questioning whether the companies that have spent billions over the decades on climate denying advertising, journalism and silencing are paying media companies to distract blame from themselves? You know, the same companies that spend hundreds of millions trying to convince the public that putting lead in gasoline was good and harmless. You know, the same companies that partnered with car companies to monopolise the transport industry buy buying up rival transport modes just to destroy them. You know, the same companies that partnered with the auto industry to build highways everywhere using government funds. You know, the same companies that have partnered for decades with oil companies to actively fight against low-emissions vehicles. The Auto industry is not beyond the scope of this argument considering the influence and role the petroleum industry has played in ensuring auto-dominance in the US.

As a part owner in these corporations, you are part of the problem and it's ironic you gripe about high prices when these actually benefit you. I have no problems with calling you a trash human being for funding corporations actively destroying the planet for wealth gain. You have no problem in funding companies that receive billions in subsidies from the government (as if they are charities) and yet you complain about companies slightly reducing their profits so people don't have to choose between filling their car up or feeding their children.

Inflation is fake you can just set prices


[20-Jul-22 10:00 PM] Trask#2574

you just believe anything you are told if it conforms to your warped worldview. You are just volunteer replicators of the ideology that keeps people infinitely more rich than you in power.


[20-Jul-22 10:06 PM] NGSpy#8096
inflation is real but its not a wage price spiral its a profit price spiral


[20-Jul-22 10:10 PM] Trask#2574
In what real sense is inflation real? Prices rise but the whole concept of "inflation" as a discreet economic phenomena that the state can't just wish away with price controls and other monetary mechanisms is more mythology than reality.


[20-Jul-22 10:11 PM] Trask#2574
Ie, it's a "concept" meant to obscure what is really happening in the economy.


[20-Jul-22 10:14 PM] NGSpy#8096
inflation is real in regards to it meaning the general rising of prices in the economy. it happens. whatever the neoclassical synthesis says about inflation as being "simple if u do X" or "cant be addressed with price controls, monetary mechanisms" is just bullshit

Inflation is the equivalent of a trolly problem hypothesis where one track has a family of five before it and the other track is empty. The person holding the lever is best friends with a guy who is the beneficiary of the family's estate. He chooses not to pull the lever and allows the family to be mowed down and then tells all the bystanders that "sorry, it's just inflation"


[20-Jul-22 10:18 PM] NGSpy#8096
true. inflation is used a lot as a "get out of jail free card" and it suffers a lot in its great generalisation

Census data has revealed a million houses are sitting empty in towns where, just metres away, working families live in tents. These off-season ghost towns simply struggle to retain some fabric of community life.

Price Controls Can Work, Sorry If This Offends
There’s something about the phrase “price controls” that drives some people — mainly economists — around the bend. But history shows that market economies rarely go very long without needing some form of price control — especially in a crisis.
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/0FHFgtllPg_4OsBG85_ZcBXv5iKUjdxHRgQNeLVmAqg/https/images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/25104110/GettyImages-1238626626.jpg


[21-Jul-22 07:21 PM] Trask#2574
```It’s high time we remembered that “natural prices” don’t exist at all. Whether via taxes, infrastructure, or relations of ownership: all of the conditions under which a commodity is produced, traded, and sold are socially and politically determined, and thus can be changed. In fact, it is impossible not to influence prices.```


[21-Jul-22 07:21 PM] Trask#2574
important point


[21-Jul-22 07:21 PM] Trask#2574
but the thing is that people who study economics are basically indoctrinated into thinking this


[21-Jul-22 07:59 PM] NGSpy#8096
yeah i thought it was quite important too. as soon as i hear the idea of a 'natural' something in economics i already think 'this is sum bullshit'

Minecraft completely rejecting NFTs and what they represent is a big deal. Minecraft is the most successful video game and virtual world in history, and WAS a big target for NFT racketeering.

Minecraft has decided NFTs have no place in its future. Huge.

Well there are some good arguments on this actyally. The argument that trains are right wing (I don’t necessarily agree with this though) is because they are run with only one destination, led by a conductor (hierarchies), no freedom of choice while *in* the train and because of the dependence on them to run when they say they will


[26-Jul-22 12:29 AM] My13InchDuck#1952

A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars; It's where the rich use public transportation.


[26-Jul-22 10:00 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
You can't tell me unironically that all the millions of people daily using public transit in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Madrid, Paris, London, etc are 'poor.' Many riders in these places are actually wealthy businessmen who use transit because it's incredibly more convenient and they can actually be productive during their journey instead of concentrating on not crashing a car


[26-Jul-22 10:02 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
People in a car should really be looking at the people in the train and be thankful that people are taking the train instead of driving and causing congestion

WASHINGTON—To listen to the corporate class, you’d think there are two causes for the inflation now hitting the U.S. economy: Democratic President Joe Biden’s policies and rising worker wages. Wrong.

And while I despise nimbys and the effects they have, I don't think a historical public park should be half torn up for developers to make a profit from, in an area where parks are few. (Because I find it highly unlikely the campus is doing this out of good will)

bay area housing crisis bruh, nimbys on a whole other level


[06-Aug-22 10:19 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
I despise nimbys; the problem is I wouldn't call these people nimbys. I think nimby is a very over-used term that has a lot of pre-assumptions included that just don't fit this scenario. In fact most of these people are probably phimbys who would support tearing down abandoned buildings nearby for social housing but don't support the removal of public green space for such projects (I wouldn't call this project social housing though); the 2 aren't mutually exclusive. 
Nimbys are terrible for many reasons but I'm also very wary of developers and their interests. And 'nimby' is often used by developers to wrongly label opposition to their projects, even when such projects would completely detract from the community. Someone opposing development because they don't like blue buildings? Yeah, that's a nimby. Someone opposing development because it's a nazi memorial or something? That's not a nimby even though the developer may use that term to garner support. If a project is going to completely detract from the community (ie removing public space, removing transit, etc) then I wouldn't call the opposers 'nimbys'


[06-Aug-22 10:22 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
There'd be a million other projects in the Bay area that are legitimately being stalled by nimbys but this isn't one of them and it's only getting media attention because of the key proponents the story has; students, homeless people, housing, protest


[06-Aug-22 10:26 AM] MR AWESOME#2496
I think it's dangerous to label any and all opposition as 'nimby' because it sets a precedent that lets developers gain support for doing whatever they want, regardless of the consequences

Holy cow: There was ZERO inflation last month. That's the headline number, which is well below expectations of +0.2%.

Also a good core inflation reading: +0.3%, also below expectations of 0.5%.

Finally some good news on the inflation front. We've likely seen the inflation peak.

Canceling $10,000 in student debt when the average white borrower is $12,000 in debt, while Black women hold on average over $52,000 isn’t just unacceptable, it’s structural racism.

The reality of Swedish capitalism
