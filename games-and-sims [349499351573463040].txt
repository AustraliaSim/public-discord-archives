[22-Aug-17 08:11 PM] Catiline#0267
Everyone gets assigned a number, and whatever that number gets is 3 civs they can choose from


[22-Aug-17 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Seems sensible


[22-Aug-17 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, once we get enough people we'll use that


[22-Aug-17 08:12 PM] Catiline#0267
It's to prevent people getting utterly trash civs, but also allowing for some randomisation


[22-Aug-17 08:12 PM] Catiline#0267
yeah


[22-Aug-17 08:12 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
That's a cool idea

Although, the last pitboss game I played, I was winning in the points tally by ~400 turns


[22-Aug-17 08:15 PM] Scrub#3915
Same @TheWhiteFerret . I only get to play singple player games, though


[22-Aug-17 08:15 PM] Scrub#3915
> 600ms ping doesn't go too well with online games


[22-Aug-17 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
pitboss it'd be fine


[22-Aug-17 08:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
civ pitboss isn't a game where 600 ping would be an issue at all


[22-Aug-17 08:16 PM] Scrub#3915
No idea what CIV Pitboss is


[22-Aug-17 08:16 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
Forza
Ferret
Maiq
Madama
Khrushchev
Null


[22-Aug-17 08:17 PM] Catiline#0267
Pitboss is basically a game that keeps running over a long period of time (A week or more)


[22-Aug-17 08:17 PM] Catiline#0267
basically it doesn't progress until you've done your turn


[22-Aug-17 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
All the pitboss games I've done in the past have been normal speed


[22-Aug-17 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
It takes way too long


[22-Aug-17 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
300 turns took 6+ months


[22-Aug-17 08:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
We'd be using the quick speed, for obvious reasons


[22-Aug-17 08:19 PM] Catiline#0267
yeah, quick is the best for multiplayer


[22-Aug-17 08:20 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
doesn't that make domination s00per d00per hard?


[22-Aug-17 08:20 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
because you tech up so quickly?


[22-Aug-17 08:21 PM] Catiline#0267
Use knights then


[22-Aug-17 08:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I might turn off certain victory conditions

[22-Aug-17 08:23 PM] Deleted User#0000

[22-Aug-17 08:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
if we don't use quick


[22-Aug-17 08:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
the game will go nowhere


[22-Aug-17 08:23 PM] m_l#8208
I know the practical concerns 😦


[22-Aug-17 08:23 PM] m_l#8208
I used to play quick almost exclusively


[22-Aug-17 08:23 PM] m_l#8208
Then I realised why I'm "bad at war"


[22-Aug-17 08:24 PM] m_l#8208
Maybe let's do a quick game


[22-Aug-17 08:24 PM] m_l#8208
then if we have fun, consider a normal one?

The only way it'd be easy is if everyone goes "Hey, let's make TWF king"


[22-Aug-17 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
So we disabled it


[22-Aug-17 08:29 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
so limit the number of city states?


[22-Aug-17 08:29 PM] Catiline#0267
Nah, city states are useful


[22-Aug-17 08:29 PM] Catiline#0267
Extra bonus and military production


[22-Aug-17 08:29 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I agree


[22-Aug-17 08:29 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I didn't say eradicate


[22-Aug-17 08:29 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I mean in order to allay Forza's fear


[22-Aug-17 08:30 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Where to get civ


[22-Aug-17 08:30 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
if we limit the number such that in order to win a diplomacy victory you need at least half of the civs in the game to vote for you or something


[22-Aug-17 08:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just the default amount for the map size the game spits out is fine


[22-Aug-17 08:31 PM] Catiline#0267
Yeah, there's likely going to be a tonne of people aiming for diplo victory considering our hours


[22-Aug-17 08:31 PM] Catiline#0267
so competition will be enough


[22-Aug-17 08:31 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
depends which civ I get


[22-Aug-17 08:31 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Can anyone recommend any game that is free


[22-Aug-17 08:31 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

[22-Aug-17 08:32 PM] m_l#8208
Dumb Q but do we get to set difficulty on multiplayer?


[22-Aug-17 08:32 PM] Catiline#0267
Yes


[22-Aug-17 08:32 PM] Catiline#0267
It should be kept at prince

[30-Aug-17 07:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
two inside forwards and a complete forward


[30-Aug-17 08:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Nice I tend to play a 4-3-3 two centre backs and role is dependent on their ability, two attacking wing back, either 2 DMs one usually a BWM and one a DLP, then a AM usually a AP or AM, or I switch it to two CMs usually same roles of instead of a DLP will be a BBM or 2 BBM again dependent on ability and an AM 2 inside forwards and either an attacking forward or complete forward


[30-Aug-17 08:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah one thing I can't get right


[30-Aug-17 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is my right inside forward always lacks goals, but always has tons of assists


[30-Aug-17 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
the left inside forward is the opposite


[30-Aug-17 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
tons of goals, barely any assists


[30-Aug-17 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Doesn't matter who I put there


[30-Aug-17 08:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, when you have a defence as good as mine is, it doesn't really matter, but its still annoying


[30-Aug-17 08:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do you tell them to exploit the right side though?


[30-Aug-17 08:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm assuming you are putting a left footed player as your right IF.


[30-Aug-17 08:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't tell them to exploit any side


[30-Aug-17 08:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
But yeah, the feet the players use is usually opposite for me


[30-Aug-17 08:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
i.e. LIF is right, RIF is left


[30-Aug-17 08:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes that's where they need to be if you are playing them as Inside forwards. I have had to change mine to wingers at times depending who goes on


[30-Aug-17 08:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Wait sorry you put a left footed inside forward on the left side?


[30-Aug-17 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000

[30-Aug-17 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Left footed inside forward on the right

[30-Aug-17 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000

[30-Aug-17 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
I always develop my complete forwards weak foot as well


[30-Aug-17 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe your team plays down the right more often that would explain the higher assists

[08-Oct-17 10:15 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

[08-Oct-17 10:15 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
the maps are near infinite no?


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] LividMilkTea#7622

these seem to spawn VERY FAR away


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] _slothsworth#4496
survival island sounds lit


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
why would we want to restrict ourselves?


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000

[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] _slothsworth#4496
so we fight and stuff


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
have as much as possible


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
turn on pvp btw


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] _slothsworth#4496
yes


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I agree we should have the option for pvp


[08-Oct-17 10:16 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
but it should only happen if it comes to that


[08-Oct-17 10:17 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
the survival bit means against nature, not eachother


[08-Oct-17 10:17 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
if we kill eachother, we kill eachother


[08-Oct-17 10:17 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
but if we work together, that's fine too


[08-Oct-17 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000

[08-Oct-17 10:17 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
if tribes form, it happens


[08-Oct-17 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you say so


[08-Oct-17 10:17 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
don't restrict us to an island


[08-Oct-17 10:17 PM] _slothsworth#4496
but we don't wanna spread out too far i reckon either


[08-Oct-17 10:18 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
if it happens, it happens


[08-Oct-17 10:18 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
(I don't imagine it will)


[08-Oct-17 10:18 PM] _slothsworth#4496
sure


[08-Oct-17 10:18 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
that would be dull


[08-Oct-17 10:18 PM] _slothsworth#4496
yeah true


[08-Oct-17 10:18 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
but I don't think it should be a colosseum type thing where we must kill or be killed


[08-Oct-17 10:19 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
we might see lmt and mtm go solo while me and nkg team up and you raid us

null you need to search the modpack through the launcher


[14-Oct-17 02:12 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
and plus you bought the game so you should be able to do stuff easily


[14-Oct-17 02:14 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
tekkit is too hard to play without support

[08-Nov-17 05:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Eventually won the UCL with the@ and numerous PL titles.


[08-Nov-17 06:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
What game was that? I've never taken a team from tiers down to PL title I get bored. Even one game when I took over West Ham after they were relegated got them back up next season Euro the following finished 3rd  bought stronger players was approached by Roma and thought fuck it 3 years is enough

[08-Nov-17 07:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
That was in FM16, only got them up to the championship. But I did qualify for Europa league via an FA Cup win


[08-Nov-17 07:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
That was mu first FM too don't recall being able to go down to the 6th teir but may have just selected down to the 5th

[08-Nov-17 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ah ok haha I remember seeing some game called Sir Alex Ferguson's Championship or something maybe Manchester United Championship. Anyway it was a ManU branded game. They were only allowed to use their players names so every other club in the PL amd every non-manU player had some weird variant.

Always play them in unimportant cup games


[14-Nov-17 03:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or loan them to teams that will play against quality opposition on a regular basis

The default division types are fairly terrible as well, so once you've got enough xp its always beneficial to make a couple of custom ones

ohhh i see


[22-Nov-17 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. Takes a while to build them up


[22-Nov-17 12:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you want a civilian factory boost, consider reducing your exports


[22-Nov-17 12:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also negative perks for Civilian Goods Factory will improve the amount of factories you can use, not positive


[22-Nov-17 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
If I want factories I usually just invade somewhere


[22-Nov-17 12:02 PM] Deleted User#0000

[13-Apr-18 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000

[13-Apr-18 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
If the host has a hoi4 dlc the rest of the lobby gets it for example I have waking the tiger and my friends don’t but when we play, we all get the focus trees


[13-Apr-18 10:13 PM] Rat#1042

owo


[15-Apr-18 05:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
ok @waltor and @Youmaton Hear me out
Basically if we ever get the Australia map working
I want to make a massive lake town venice/braavos thing in sydney where blacktown and parramatta are and make an offshoot of that flow from there to lake burley griffin so its possible to travel to canberra by boat from sydney
I want to connect up wollongong, nowra, jervis bay and the like with the canberra river
Then i want to continue flowing from lake burley griffin to a point in the yarra before the river starts to get weird and does its own thing so it flows right into melbourne habour and I want to build two massive arch/bridges but entirely covered (again like braavos) one at the entrance to port phillip (or whatever the melbourne sorrento bay thing is called) and another one at the heads in Sydney
Am i nuts? (sorry for ping and text wall)


[15-Apr-18 05:45 PM] Youmaton#1190
sounds good


[15-Apr-18 05:45 PM] Youmaton#1190
If we ever get a proper server running, it would be cool to implement things that get passed down in parliament into it @ChairmanMeeseeks


[15-Apr-18 05:45 PM] Youmaton#1190

Ikr


[16-Apr-18 05:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
They say it's the easiest difficulty


[16-Apr-18 05:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
But it's much easier being king


[16-Apr-18 05:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
being an independent count is ez


[16-Apr-18 05:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
especially ireland


[16-Apr-18 05:33 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Yeah but that's noob island


[16-Apr-18 05:35 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Friggin French nobleman? You get wiped out for supporting the king in a peasant revolt which happens all the time but the ai doesn't help you so you get cucked


[16-Apr-18 05:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm playing as the count of Bordeax


[16-Apr-18 05:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
or however you spell it


[16-Apr-18 05:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Watch
You'll get peasant revolted


[16-Apr-18 05:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Always happens to me


[16-Apr-18 05:40 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[16-Apr-18 05:53 PM] Youmaton#1190

[16-Apr-18 05:59 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Also try switching the recording mode


[19-Apr-18 07:01 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I presume you're using the OpenGL whatever it is?


[19-Apr-18 07:02 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I don't use Windows so I can't remember what the options are but there should be another option for "Source" that doesn't go through GL


[19-Apr-18 07:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
yep that did it, thanks @RunasSudo

Im on the verge of tears


[20-Apr-18 11:56 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
im in the middle of the seven years war but 200 years early because england decided to invade scotland and call me in


[20-Apr-18 11:57 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and france is on scotlands side


[20-Apr-18 11:58 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so after taking the entire south of france, england decided to piss about in ireland, leaving scotland and france to rebuild their armies and bring doom upon us both and left me on the defensive, with my colonial garrisons scrambling to organise into a force to help defend the motherland


[20-Apr-18 11:58 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so 50k of france coming in against 10k spaniards in a border fort

Fair enough. I'm a relative newbie, being a convert from FIFA


[01-May-18 03:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but the last FIFA I properly played was FIFA 13


[01-May-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Haha yeah FIFA 16 I think was my last one. But obvs two entirely different games. Before I got FM I did have an EA sports  game called Total Football Manager that was good except it had some of stuff like you got to control sponsorship and who you sold it to to try and get better deals. And you had options to buy items with the money you earnt. Along with family options like buying dog, getting married, chance to have children etc


[01-May-18 04:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well that stuff is cool but unneccesary


[01-May-18 04:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I have owned all Fifas up to 17 but played very little out of all of them

[01-May-18 05:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
also have 9 where I played a lot of career mode


[01-May-18 05:40 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[13-May-18 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmmm I wish I was able to get 900 ducats/month when I played as Portugal.  Maximising the trade functions is a weak spot of mine. And then I didn't realise that some colonies would be a seperate nation but not independent e.g Portugal Australia and Portugal South Africa and thus I wouldn't get as much money coming in


[13-May-18 07:11 PM] Deleted User#0000

[13-May-18 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm in the middle of my second HOIIV game not going too bad. Playing as America though it is 1947 and the war is still going on. Japan didn't surrender despite dropping a-bombs on Tokyo, Hiroshima and another one (not Nagasaki) and we are slowly making moves through Europe. Have taken Spain (which joined the Axis) have got most of Italy and currently holding a line from Genoa to Venice. Have taken back Greece but Yugoslavia (who also joined Axis) and Fascist Romania are holding my army off there. The Soviet Union capitulated early on and now hold a few provinces in Eastern Europe and in East Asia with the remaining provinces (about 90%) being split between Germany and Japan.


[13-May-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
My first game I just continued the tutorial of Italy and I all of Africa and still Italy but Germany has fallen and I am holding off the forces from the French and Austrian sides as well as any naval invasions. And I can't sue for peace because Japan is still dominating East Asia and they are the war leaders it is 1955 in that game before I decided to start a new one since this first one is pretty much at a stalemate


[13-May-18 07:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Should say that second game Peru recently entered the war so now I have Peru marching through Brazil and coming close to Venezuela which I took in the 1930s


[13-May-18 07:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I remember I once played a hoi game as the U.K. I literally did a Dunkirk (evacuated 20 divisions that I sent to defend France). Than Germany invaded Norway and Yugoslavia. I sent my army there and basically pushed the Axis out of Norway while I lost Yugoslavia after Italy naval invaded Greece. Africa was won the next year and I did a D-day in 1945 and took Berlin in '46 . I don't know why I remember this game but yeah.

I wish I was good at trade in EU


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] m_l#8208
see i tried eu3 and it was too difficult


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] m_l#8208
but tbh that was before i played any paradox


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
EU4 is dumbed down


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
its so easy


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] m_l#8208
i can do ck2 just fine


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
ck2 was after eu3


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you just place everybody on the most profitable nodes


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it was the first of the easier games


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and get them to collect


[18-May-18 08:26 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
then you get fleets to guard it


[18-May-18 08:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
then watch the cash come on


[18-May-18 08:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
build stock exchanges and shit as well


[18-May-18 08:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
HOI4 is not complex really

@ChairmanMeeseeks I will need to look again I have only played one game


[18-May-18 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
How can you tell what is a profitable node?


[18-May-18 08:27 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
in the Trade screen


[18-May-18 08:28 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Usually English Channel and Bordeax


[18-May-18 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Regardless of trade power then?

[18-May-18 08:29 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well, Eng channel and Bordeaux are the biggest. your home node is usally your most profitable

[18-May-18 08:34 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
its in WTT. It allows you to go democratic, communist or restore the Kaiser


[18-May-18 08:35 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Best strat -> snipe poland then restore kaiser


[18-May-18 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh right restore the Kaiser and then start WWII anyway


[18-May-18 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Napoleon Freeze so they can't change government without that?


[18-May-18 08:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
you can do it the long, boring way of using the politicians


[18-May-18 08:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but they nerfed the rate which you can affect that


[18-May-18 08:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
restore the kaiser is instant civil war


[18-May-18 08:36 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[23-May-18 03:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The trick is to build light tank divisions and infantry
Couple them together to assualt the lines, then let the LT zoom off and encircle


[23-May-18 03:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
So 4 infantry divisions and 2 LT per province if you can afford that level of unit concentration


[23-May-18 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm interesting tactic. My tank divisions are just heavy and modern tanks. Never used light tanks


[23-May-18 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I thought mobile infantry on thebhalf tracks would be fast but apparently not


[23-May-18 03:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I try to get medium tanks ASAP and most of my tank divisions are medium (allthough get upgraded to modern when I get them) with motorized and mot rocket artillery (surprisingly good at sucking out organization from infantry). I also sometimes use a combo of medium and heavy


[23-May-18 04:33 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
I use modern and heavy most of the time


[23-May-18 04:34 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
That's the only time I use light tanks


[23-May-18 04:34 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
For fast encirclement


[23-May-18 04:34 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Mechanized don't have the breakthrough that LT does

[23-May-18 06:21 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Mechanized has the same principle though and can be more versatile in application


[23-May-18 06:21 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Basically


[23-May-18 06:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Do you want divisions that can be sorta handy in most scenarios?


[23-May-18 06:22 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Or a division that's only good in one
But it fucking Rocks in that scenario


[23-May-18 06:23 PM] Deleted User#0000

Designing divisions is something I need to work on. But the support companies I think I have a good fit


[23-May-18 08:35 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The trick is to make sure they're multiples of 20 width


[23-May-18 08:35 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
However 10 width is minimal


[23-May-18 08:35 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
20 width is average


[23-May-18 08:36 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
40 width is a pretty big division


[23-May-18 08:36 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
80 width is ridiculous


[23-May-18 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which means?


[23-May-18 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Combat width is basically how many divisions you can fit in a province to fight (let’s say for example the province has 80 combat width to fit in total, than you could fight 4 20 widths divisions to fight) but yes you want 40 and 20 width divisions m

[24-May-18 06:34 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[24-May-18 06:35 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The more battalion's you add


[24-May-18 06:35 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The more combat width the division has


[24-May-18 06:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
How can you tell what the combat width of a division is? Or for that matter what the max in a province is.

I thought combat width was how many divisions a commander could have in the front line based on their ability as I've seen 5 divisions against 3 and both have had divisions waiting.


[24-May-18 09:08 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Combat width shows up in all the other statistics in the division builder


[24-May-18 11:06 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

Can I end the war just by taking the Japanese home islands or will it keep going?


[27-May-18 03:27 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
japanese home islands work


[27-May-18 03:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but its a pain in the ass to do


[27-May-18 03:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
especially if you land and fight your way up


[27-May-18 03:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
you normally get bogged down and it takes 3 months


[27-May-18 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's december 1948 3 months won't be much


[27-May-18 03:28 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if you nuke before invading its easier


[27-May-18 03:29 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
because nukes on cities lower stability


[27-May-18 03:29 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so its easier to capitulate them


[27-May-18 03:29 PM] Deleted User#0000

[27-May-18 03:32 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
save like ten


[27-May-18 03:32 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
then when you land, if you get bottlenecked, drop a nuke


[27-May-18 03:33 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

[30-Jul-18 07:15 PM] showstealer1829#6775
In terms of the game's portrayal. Stormcloaks easily

If we were converting this to real life: Thalmor faction best faction

Like you need a certain population to take out a loan and build certain buildings

If a game needs dlc to makenit playable then it isn't a good game. A dlc should just enhance it

someone on reddit posted the best hoi4 tip


[18-Sep-18 03:57 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
if you're a minor or you have shittons of really terrible divisions, delete all but one


[18-Sep-18 03:57 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
then use that one to train


[18-Sep-18 03:57 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
because army xp is based on percentage of divisions training not number


[18-Sep-18 03:57 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so 1 division in a 2 division army will get you more than 10 divisions in a 30 division army


[18-Sep-18 03:58 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so the way to maximise xp is to only have one division and have that division just farm xp


[18-Sep-18 03:58 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and thats only breaking one divisions worth of equipment


[18-Sep-18 05:06 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948

[27-Oct-18 12:21 AM] Youmaton#1190
apparently its in my library, didnt even realise i had it


[27-Oct-18 04:34 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
oh its great


[27-Oct-18 04:35 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and I knew you did because you played agot that one time


[27-Oct-18 04:35 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
anyway, yes its very good


[27-Oct-18 04:35 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
its harder than hoi4 tho


[27-Oct-18 04:35 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like way harder


[27-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
I find hoi4 harder


[27-Oct-18 10:59 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
Same. In order of difficulty I go HOI4, Viki2, EU4, Stellaris, CK2. 

CK2 is my most played and favourite so I know it very well


[27-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Rat#1042
I find CK2 harder than Hoi4


[27-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Rat#1042
There's are lot more you gotta think about in CK


[27-Oct-18 11:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Lot more to be mindful of in HoI4


[27-Oct-18 11:47 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
nah you can go straight into a game of hoi4 like i did with the fundamentals and do pretty goddamn well


[27-Oct-18 11:48 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
my first game of ck2 i watched tutorials months before i got the game and my game ended like three years in


[27-Oct-18 11:48 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
tbf that was because of a guy giving me really shitty advice


[27-Oct-18 11:48 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but a lot of it was game complexity


[27-Oct-18 11:49 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like he legit told me to give my guy all the best and worst traits so i could pass the best ones on to my kids but the worst ones would stay behind


[27-Oct-18 11:49 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
so id have an heir with great traits and then my guy would die and id have the ultimate char


[27-Oct-18 11:49 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
problem with that, your guy has like 0 fertility and dies immediately if you do that


[27-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'll show you my first game of CK2 later no months of tutorials just a bit of reading


[27-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Same as I did with HoI4 but there is a lot more to consider


[27-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
HOI4 is fairly easy


[27-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
just a lot of micro of troops


[27-Oct-18 04:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
^


[27-Oct-18 04:12 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the naval shit is complicated


[27-Oct-18 04:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and figuring out what to do with your factories is really the skill


[27-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
For navy I set and forget


[27-Oct-18 04:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but yeah, its fairly easy


[27-Oct-18 04:13 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
same with planes really


[27-Oct-18 04:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
yeah but see thats the probelm


[27-Oct-18 04:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
setting and forgeting is actually not what your meant to do


[27-Oct-18 04:13 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
theres a mechanic for it


[27-Oct-18 04:14 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
like you can send you navy to back up your troops in a naval invasion and they'll do bonus damage


[27-Oct-18 04:14 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
but its not a select mission or anything, you have to put it in the adjacent sea province


[27-Oct-18 05:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Design templates, organising armies, setting tactics, production, ensuring you have enough supplies. If you are playing a smaller country managing your manpower

[27-Oct-18 05:29 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Supplies, automated but you have to keep lines open
Armies, automated with two clicks
Production, automated
Tactics is part of armies
Templates and manpower as a minor is super simple
Just delete all your divisions but one and set it to train
Then farm the xp
Then do a template, then recruit


[27-Oct-18 05:29 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Kapooya kasha


[27-Oct-18 05:29 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
You now have a fully operational army


[27-Oct-18 05:30 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Templates as a major is harder, but doable


[27-Oct-18 05:30 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
You normally have focuses for army xp


[27-Oct-18 05:41 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

ck2 you'll be fine with, but you gotta take it slow and start out as a count in Ireland


[27-Oct-18 05:42 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399

@Deleted User played both Hoi4 and ck2 combined with about 1000 hours of gameplay. To an individual who hasn't played either game I'd say Hoi4 is much easier to learn and succeed in comparison to CK2.

[30-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Australia is boring to play, can't do shit. I've ran out of manpower and the only reason I'm so large is because I continually take control of Malay divisions. So have the Malayan Peninsula  and Borneo defended to the hilt and the meager navy patrolling around but can't increase. Also have a crusier ready to deploy but no men to fill it.

[30-Oct-18 07:00 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I don't know what it's actually from. People often use it to explain Germany's actions in the world wars as they seem to like declaring war on everyone around them

You only have to get the code once


[26-Nov-18 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
plus After 1st October, you will need to log into the Paradox Plaza website with your Paradox Account to access the codes for previous branches of each game that you own. This will, however, require you to link your Steam account to your Paradox Account.

[27-Nov-18 07:38 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I wish cities skylines allowed you to make a street circuit for racing on (like motorsport) and then close that area off once a year for money and tourism, at the cost of grid efficiency and possibly noise pollution depending on what cars you invite.


[27-Nov-18 07:39 PM] Rat#1042

[27-Nov-18 07:42 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
yea like F1 or Formula E(ww) or the V8 Supercars


[27-Nov-18 07:43 PM] DirtySaiyan#0464
Supercars* not V8s anymore 😛


[27-Nov-18 07:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
YOU CAN TAKE THE V8 OUT OF THE ENGINE BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE THE V8 FROM SUPERCAR

[27-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
@DirtySaiyan no. The rules are that you *can* run a v8, v6 turbo or v4 turbo. No one has moved away from v8. Holden, as you showed, looked at a v6 turbo, but for an unknown reason they shelved the project heading into this year.


[27-Nov-18 08:00 PM] Rat#1042
there are props you can place to make it look like that


[27-Nov-18 08:02 PM] DirtySaiyan#0464
@Napoleon Freeze I think they shelved it because of how successful the car at the time was doing, so there was no real need for it. On top of that the other teams hadn't transitioned to either the v6 or v4


[27-Nov-18 08:07 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I think it would be that it would be too expensive to bring up to a level to compete with the existing hardware. Look at all the money Nissan, Mercedes and Volvo all piled in over the last 5 years, with the last of them Nissan being the third manufacturer to pull out.


[27-Nov-18 08:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
for reference: the ability to designate this as "racetrack" would be awesome.

[22-Dec-18 10:34 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
A game where you play a citizen within a nation and you can participate in the military, politics, businesses, the media etc. It's the type of game you can play very casually for 10 mins a day or get much more involved and spend several hours a day on it


[22-Dec-18 10:34 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
So we're signing up in Australia, other starting nations are likely to be the USA, Serbia, Brazil and Poland


[22-Dec-18 10:35 AM] Viado Celtru#6988
They will all have their own citizens and will try to advance their nations which will cause conflicts with other nations which Australia might become involved in

You'll need a senior affiliate so you can get loan players for free

alternatively, have a look through some u23 squads for loan listed youngsters


[27-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
or players deemed as not needed


[27-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
quite often a club will allow a player out on loan if they're transfer listed


[27-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
and you include an optional transfer clause in the loan


[27-Dec-18 06:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

Last game I ended up at Grasshoppers had no money and half the starting XI were loaned players. Next Season I ended up at Rapid Vienna and had a $30M transfer budget and large wage budget, while it was good I couldn't attract great players because we were only in the Austrian Premier Division

Adelaide Tram Closures
Questions and answers

Why are trams being shut down?
Adelaide Metro has taken the decision to close the tram system from 1 January 2019 to 1 August 2019 to allow for the upgrade of tram infrastructure and construction of new tram tracks in the city centre. 

What are the tram tracks being constructed?
Tram tracks will be constructed east to west on Sabrina Blvd until O’Connell Street; north to south on Albert Reed Blvd until Greenaway St; east to west on Greenaway St full length; east to west Parker St from Taylor Ave to O’Connell St; north to south Pierre Elliott Trudeau Rd until Manor St; west to east Manor St until Park Ave; east to west Cedar Blvd (Marion) to Marion Road; north to south Marion Road from Cedar Blvd to Meminger Street.
Meminger Street corridor upgraded to provide dedicated tram lanes.

Will the routes change?
Yes. Routes will be changed from the current system to numbered routes which will be designed to better serve demand put on the tram system. 

Will the trams themselves be changed?
Yes. Smaller capacity trams will be placed on routes with large sections of shared lane tram tracks. 

Will substitute buses be provided?
Depending on the route, Adelaide Metro has elected to either create a new temporary bus route or increase capacity on existing modes of transport.
Replacement services for lines:
Line    Replacement mode
Central    200 bus service rerouted. Change at Sabrina Blvd Interchange to 495 bus OR catch Northern Line train service.
Beach    Catch temporary Beach line substitute bus
City Loop    Catch 99C/A bus services
District    Birdsong to CBD:  Catch 99A/C bus
CBD to Myrtle: Catch 548 bus

If you're going for a Keeper


[30-Jan-19 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Perin or Leno would be good


[30-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
or if you can stick with one of what you've got for now, consider a youngster


[30-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
someone like Simone Scuffet


[30-Jan-19 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why isn't Koscieny starting?


[30-Jan-19 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Your keeper is performing quite well nkg


[30-Jan-19 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
6.9 average rating, where 6.7 is a pass


[30-Jan-19 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Your defence is underperforming


[30-Jan-19 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can Wellbeck play as a Left Winger or Inside Forward?


[30-Jan-19 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
specifically bartra and debuchy


[30-Jan-19 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah Koscieny has a rating of 7.2 and is the CB


[30-Jan-19 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
How is Chambers as a Right Back?


[30-Jan-19 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Bartra is always a rotation option in high tier FM


[30-Jan-19 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
a squad rotation or come off the bench type of player


[30-Jan-19 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
In FM15 he was more of a right back BC


[30-Jan-19 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
irl He's developed into a CB/DM


[30-Jan-19 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then I would but him on in place of Debuchy


[30-Jan-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
He's certainly in better form


[30-Jan-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
But given that i've played like 1500 hours of fm15


[30-Jan-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can say Chambers is never a starting right back at a premier league club


[30-Jan-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I purchased Chambers in my FM16 game when I was coachin West Ham in the early 2020s


[30-Jan-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
sorry, top 4 premier league club


[30-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
He develops sometimes into a decent player


[30-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah lot of injuries doesn't help


[30-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
This may help for future players

[30-Jan-19 10:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would have to see Sanchez's stats but I would push him up as a winger on the left, put Walcott or Oxlade Chamberlain on the right drop one of your strikers and put in a second CM have him as  BWM or BBM to pair with the DPM


[30-Jan-19 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe see if Pavel Kaderabek is available and good enough


[30-Jan-19 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
And if your fullbacks are up for it make them attacking rather than automatic


[30-Jan-19 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
if not up to it put them as support


[30-Jan-19 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
From memory he was a pretty good RB


[30-Jan-19 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
He does develop well


[30-Jan-19 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Was monreal good in fm15


[30-Jan-19 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can't remember


[30-Jan-19 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'll download fm15


[30-Jan-19 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
From memory, when I played as arsenal


[30-Jan-19 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I always replaced my fullbacks first


[30-Jan-19 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
But that was ages ago


[30-Jan-19 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'll fire up my save and check it out


[30-Jan-19 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think Jose Gaya was a good left back


[30-Jan-19 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
quite young


[30-Jan-19 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
rip


[30-Jan-19 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
and if Chambers is at arsenal


[30-Jan-19 10:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
Luke Shaw is at Man United right?


[30-Jan-19 10:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would stick with Szczesny


[30-Jan-19 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
sell ospina


[30-Jan-19 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Buy a young keeper like Simone Scuffet


[30-Jan-19 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I used to get Baines as a backup when everton released him at like 36

[30-Jan-19 10:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
mhmm


[30-Jan-19 10:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can go from tier 24 (all amateur till like tier 8)

[30-Jan-19 10:35 PM] Deleted User#0000

[30-Jan-19 10:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
fm15 runs so much slower


[30-Jan-19 10:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
FM17 really was a massive change

did you sell ozil?


[30-Jan-19 10:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe try and buy


[30-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ricardo Rodriguez


[30-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just got him first try for 20m + 50% of next profit


[30-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
So probably less with haggling


[30-Jan-19 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
weirdly, the same fee for Alex Sandro


[30-Jan-19 10:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
who would arguably be the better long term signing


[30-Jan-19 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sandro develops better


[30-Jan-19 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
well, can develop better


[30-Jan-19 10:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, and right from the start Sandro isn't that far behind ability wise


[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Go for Sandro


[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
He's probably as good as either of your left backs


[30-Jan-19 10:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
but absolutely will be far better


[30-Jan-19 11:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just sold Monreal, Flamini, Ospina, Gnabry, Chambers to fund buying Bernd Leno for 30m


[30-Jan-19 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Spent the rest of my money on


[30-Jan-19 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sandro, Mitrovic and Passlack


[30-Jan-19 11:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
and I should have enough left over for Danilo


[30-Jan-19 11:07 PM] Deleted User#0000

[31-Jan-19 07:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Your fullbacks are still weak


[31-Jan-19 07:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Although playing them as wing backs


[31-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
My issue is I struggle with having depth


[31-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I don't like having good players as reserves because they get uppity


[31-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
also money


[31-Jan-19 09:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah they get annoyed hence rotation and good man management


[31-Jan-19 09:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I normally just rotate through my bench really


[31-Jan-19 09:48 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
basically I like to run a 22/23 man squad


[31-Jan-19 09:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
have my first team, 5 bench and the rest


[31-Jan-19 09:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and my bench is usually wing back/defender, 2 midfielders, winger/striker


[31-Jan-19 09:49 AM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
oh and a keeper


[31-Jan-19 02:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Deleted User They're wonderkids


[31-Jan-19 02:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
They'll be the best fullbacks in the world in 2-3 years


[31-Jan-19 02:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Danilo / Alex Sandro


[31-Jan-19 02:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
and yes, in that SS I forgot to put sandro in the starting team


[31-Jan-19 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah ok I never worry about the future


[31-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I never usually start as top clubs


[31-Jan-19 03:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
so its always a priority


[31-Jan-19 03:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah tend not to, however, in this current save I did.

I'm no good at raising youth plus not sure how to do it so just look to buy the best I can afford

Or if in a lower team also look to get star young players on loan


[31-Jan-19 03:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
usually i have them as rotation players for 6-12 months


[31-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
then loan them out for 1-2 years

[02-Mar-19 03:50 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
fascist israel had yom kippur war with egypt, then egypt declared war on me (USSR) and Iran defected from Warsaw pact to help egypt, so i took out Egypt and Iran but Franco (who had been pushed back by france to the balerics some ten years previously) decided to keep the war going to i had to go slap him as well


[02-Mar-19 03:50 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
during which time the poles decided to break free from me


[02-Mar-19 03:51 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
and Yugoslavia, who held a significant amount of turf in the war, split thirty years early and went with serbia, meaning they've cockblocked me AND are now gonna go with USA


[02-Mar-19 03:52 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
its fine tho, Canada, UK (which has now gone fascist somehow) and Aus are all under my control and PRC is my puppet, so i figure basically the USSR has won the cold war


[02-Mar-19 03:52 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
Although I just got Brezhnev who will absolutely fuck me in the ass because he's so goddamn awful


[02-Mar-19 03:53 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
the focus tree is literally to just completely fuck my economy into oblivion and then kill my stability

I haven't downloaded it yet but was watching a gameplay video looked like fun


[04-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
You just take your warship with a bunch of other people and look to destroy another team?


[04-Jun-19 08:56 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Yeah, essentially. Once you pick a country and what class of ship you're going with, you earn research points to start moving you towards the next tier of ship, until you reach the top. Obviously each tier is better, and i think around tier 4 or 5 you start running into aircraft carriers


[04-Jun-19 08:58 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
There's different game modes, usually it's just conquer points on a map, but there is also this one weird one with concentric circles and each one is a zone you can capture


[05-Jun-19 04:06 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Now that i think about it the later levels do tend to get grindy


[05-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Other then that though it's pretty good


[05-Jun-19 05:58 AM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
The game that was in those last few screenshots is rather fun as well even if rather overpriced

Best way to win that game is to make a communist dictatorship. Can't be assassinated if you assassinate everyone first.

@Deleted User it's a great game but I've never beem assassinated in it

China to ban online games because they are an “authority vacuum” - ...
New laws are intended to reduce contact with gamers from other parts of the world
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/fnqf-uH_3UtGktoBRrQvtnLiGjK8W9Z10GU5jiOixuU/https/s.videogamer.com/meta/8d8b/51721d01-7788-457e-9b7d-d5382b846b86_3644995-a6jayctgdkfnigi3s7ugzf.jpg


[16-Apr-20 03:02 PM] inactive#6974
ok


[16-Apr-20 03:02 PM] doctor#0002
Now, the government has been alerted to an “authority vacuum” in online multiplayer games. The Chinese Communist Party is said to be unhappy that Chinese players are able to engage in unregulated spaces for socialisation in these games. Consequently, new laws are being created to “expand the scope of online censorship in video games,” and prevent players from interacting with gamers in the rest of the world.

In addition, online single-player games will be screened, as well as these online multiplayer games. An incoming law will require players to use their legal name rather than a username in the game, and it will also cover the exclusion of “zombies and plagues, map editing, role playing, as well as organising a union” from interactive experiences. Other new laws are not directly related to censorship, such as an online gaming curfew for children and young people, and a maximum amount of money people are permitted to spend on games to ameliorate internet addiction.


[16-Apr-20 03:44 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well, as much as its a stupid idea it certainly stops game companies being dumb and trying to cater to the chinese


[16-Apr-20 03:47 PM] doctor#0002
they're not actually banning online games


[16-Apr-20 03:47 PM] doctor#0002
its just clickbait


[16-Apr-20 03:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
wait oof


[16-Apr-20 03:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so all rpg's and adventures are gone


[16-Apr-20 03:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
pubg might not be good


[16-Apr-20 03:50 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I mean the max a person can spend online is not too awful

[13-May-20 12:39 PM] doctor#0002
it’s on sale and I want to know if I should buy it


[13-May-20 12:50 PM] RunasSudo#2416
I have it but haven't played much


[13-May-20 12:50 PM] RunasSudo#2416
The soundtrack is nice though 😛


[13-May-20 01:38 PM] doctor#0002
yeah I used to listen to the eu4 soundtrack and I stumbled upon the Stellaris soundtrack that way a few times


[13-May-20 05:43 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Stellaris had a bit of a learning curve and I haven't been able to play much, but what little I've played I've enjoyed


[13-May-20 05:52 PM] doctor#0002
Thank you


[13-May-20 06:25 PM] doctor#0002
im prob gonna buy it and utopia dlc


[13-May-20 06:25 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Nice


[13-May-20 06:25 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I really need to get back into it


[13-May-20 06:32 PM] doctor#0002
$24.15 aud for both very cool


[13-May-20 06:33 PM] doctor#0002
and paypal pressured me to donate $1 to lifeline so i did of course


[13-May-20 07:42 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I enjoy it but it has quite a few DLCs that you would need


[13-May-20 07:42 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Like all paradox games


[13-May-20 07:42 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Definitely worth it for $24


[13-May-20 07:42 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I mean DLCs enhance, but the game is still perfectly playable without


[13-May-20 07:42 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Yeah


[13-May-20 07:43 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
I didn't really get into it before I invested in a bunch of DLC


[13-May-20 07:44 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Same with eu4


[13-May-20 07:44 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Now they are my favourite paradox games


[13-May-20 08:38 PM] doctor#0002
It annoys me that paradox does that


[13-May-20 08:39 PM] doctor#0002
like pretty much everyone just waits for the dlc to go on sale


[13-May-20 08:39 PM] doctor#0002
idk why they have to make 20 DLC at $15 each for all of their games


[13-May-20 08:40 PM] doctor#0002
And the base game is like $40 still


[13-May-20 08:45 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
i do like that they are constantly improving and building on features/new features


[13-May-20 08:46 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
it makes for better, more enjoyable games for longer

@SocialistAcid#2094 I was wondering why I wanted one so bad


[13-Jun-20 04:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why? Not the echo chamber he wanted it to be?

i asked a while ago if anyone knew if stellaris was good bc i was going to buy it


[22-Jun-20 10:43 PM] doctor#0002
i did end up buying it but i havent played it in over a month and i have 3 hours of playtime


[22-Jun-20 10:43 PM] doctor#0002
the game is too confusing and weird for me


[22-Jun-20 10:43 PM] doctor#0002
i dont understand it

Mixer is dead


[23-Jun-20 12:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Microsoft now partnering with FB for a new platform.


[23-Jun-20 12:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Streamers who were on Mixer exclusively (ie Ninja) are released from their contracts.


[23-Jun-20 12:39 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
expect ninja back on twitch next week?


[23-Jun-20 01:02 PM] doctor#0002
Yikes


[23-Jun-20 01:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
20-30 mil for Ninja in August last year was that deal


[23-Jun-20 01:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
ad its lasted all of 10 months


[23-Jun-20 01:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
even though he's lost a fair amount of followers, thats not a bad tradeoff


[23-Jun-20 01:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and undoubtedly he'll come back to twitch


[23-Jun-20 01:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well


[23-Jun-20 01:08 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I assume he will


[23-Jun-20 01:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Mixer itself will run untill July 22


[23-Jun-20 01:09 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so i assume their streamers are locked in till then


[24-Jun-20 06:40 PM] showstealer1829#6775
Ninja will go to Youtube. There's way too much bad blood with Twitch. Shroud will likely go back to Twitch though

[24-Jun-20 08:35 PM] doctor#0002
I have tried but I don’t have the patience


[24-Jun-20 08:35 PM] doctor#0002
I watched one episode of a tutorial series


[24-Jun-20 08:35 PM] doctor#0002
Like I don’t get the point of the game


[24-Jun-20 08:36 PM] doctor#0002
If I find a solar system where no planets are habitable, do I just leave and try to find a habitable planet somewhere else?


[24-Jun-20 08:57 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Depends


[24-Jun-20 08:57 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Is it a natural choke point?


[24-Jun-20 08:57 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Does it have resource rich asteroids to mine?


[24-Jun-20 08:58 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Does it give you access to richer systems?


[24-Jun-20 08:58 PM] Viado Celtru#6988
Think of stellaris as a space version of civ


[25-Jun-20 04:17 AM] RMSteve#7137
