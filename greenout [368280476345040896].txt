[26-Jul-18 09:12 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Good morning all, welcome to Greenout’s analysis of the recent HCA rulings on the Brisbane and Chisholm by-elections.


[26-Jul-18 09:13 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
We have seen the court send voters back to the polls in both seats after tied votes.


[26-Jul-18 09:18 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Further to that, the court ruled in the case *HCA C/4* that modifiers counting towards the sim vote are not considered independently of other by-elections occurring simultaneously means that if you’re not running in all by-elections that are run at the same time, you’ll potentially miss out on crucial party modifiers under the current system.


[26-Jul-18 09:21 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
It will be interesting to see what the parties do about that, especially considering that some parties struggle to get candidates to run in all seats. Brisbane being a very safe seat for the left at this point in time, it presents a conundrum for the Liberal government and the recently anonymous Party of Free Citizens. Do you run and waste time and resources on a seat you can’t win for some modifiers that might help get the sim vote in the other seat?


[26-Jul-18 09:24 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Discussions in the wake of the court ruling have turned to reforming the voting system. With the AEC-endorsed bill to remove large sections of the current laws governing elections struck down in the House over concerns that the AEC would get too much power to make the regulations, any changes need parliamentary approval. The House of Representatives supported a motion to make a committee looking into this issue, what will they come up with?


[26-Jul-18 09:25 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
There are a range of views on how much simmed voting should be applied to electoral practice, ranging from its entire removal to the full implementation of simulated voting over human voting based on activity.


[26-Jul-18 09:28 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
My personal view is that a human vote should be calculated at a value of 100, and the simmed vote should be proportional to the modifiers accrued to each candidate as a percentage of the 100  value assigned to the simmed voter. We shall see if that is a proposal, a small change meant to reward all candidates who accrue modifiers, that gets broad support.


[26-Jul-18 09:30 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Finally, we shall see if any new policies are announced by the parliamentary parties and candidates during the campaigns in Brisbane and Chisholm. Both sides have largely failed to rouse the interests of reformists and budget junkies so far in the term - perhaps some big ticket items could appear above the parapets this week or next?


[26-Jul-18 09:31 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
I only hope that some environmental protection policy, and climate change action is supported during the campaigns. Greenout is disappointed in all sides failing to take meaningful action past passing a neutered motion recognising environmental damage occurring right now.


[26-Jul-18 09:32 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
This has been Greenout. Tune in next time for more amateur and likely biased analysis with bare naked shilling for the Greens.

After processing the horrible news about AnswerMeNow1’s wife, we wish them both all the best. As the inaugural New Greens member in parliament, they provided the leadership required to restore a nascent environmentalist political force going again.

We look forward to welcoming a new leader of the Greens.


[30-Jul-18 11:35 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Phyllicanderer, current Deputy leader, Speaker of the House of Representatives and shadow Treasurer would be an immediate favourite for the role.


[30-Jul-18 11:36 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Brisbane candidate hk-laichar also appears to be a good chance at the leadership.


[30-Jul-18 11:37 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Could we see a principal speaker leadership arrangement, similar to overseas green parties, emerge from the party leadership discussion?

The leadership should have a good, long hard look at itself, especially the deputy leader who seems more occupied with parliamentary processes as Speaker than party leadership.


[06-Aug-18 01:06 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
The budget is due and the government is going so far as to fail to turn up or make arrangements for Question Time. Now they have been resigned to depending on independents for confidence, they may find that more obfuscation and mistruths may lead to a Tasmanian Devil sweeping their government aside in a whirlwind of ignored ultimatums.


[06-Aug-18 01:07 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
Independent Tasmanian MP dyljam has just about had enough, and it will be intriguing to see if PineappleCrusher_ can keep his support.


[06-Aug-18 01:08 PM] phyllicanderer#1345
Judging on some of the answers forthcoming from Free Citizens Leader Senator BellmanTGM, perhaps the cabal supporting the Liberals may be ready to cut them loose.

What an interesting press conference


[03-Sep-18 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmmmm


[03-Sep-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
No sense delaying the inevitable


[03-Sep-18 09:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well no real choice to be honest, maximum campaign time is 14 days and must be held on a Saturday. I think the PM has done the right thing of calling for an election rather than lose a VONC


[03-Sep-18 09:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well Its obviously a flip flop from the government. Initially they said no early election, but as soon as it was obvious that they were going to lose a VONC they moved to dissolved parliament. If they had any grace or honour they would have called an early election days ago when it was clear this was the trajectory in which the government was headed.


[03-Sep-18 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not sure anyone was predicting the CA withdrawing support


[03-Sep-18 09:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
My point is that the government has been forced into this position by the VONC. This is not an early election of their own choosing, but an opportunistic attempt by them to get on top of an extremely chaotic situation. They might have just been better off letting themselves get deposed.


[03-Sep-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think any future government is going to be a coalition.


[03-Sep-18 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think a coalition is inevitable, as it always has been for almost every one of our governments. I honestly predict a Labour government in coalition with several centrist MP's because I cant see the Liberal government surviving this election. While there has been a surge in the centre, the voter turnout for this segment of the voting block has always been diminished and I am skeptical that any of them are going to be able to pull together a government.


[03-Sep-18 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I think the Liberal party won't be in government but they will still be around. PineappleCrusher is the preferred PM, closely followed by Youma but there is a third dark house, would've been interesting to see second most preferred PM after the first.


[03-Sep-18 09:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not sure on the inner workings and what exactly happened, certainly wouldn't have been the way I would've worked with a coalition partner.


[03-Sep-18 09:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it was totally petty and reflective of a government and a Prime Minister totally detached from reality. They were the ones who broke their agreement with Centre Alliance by voting down and failing to guarantee supply for their bill in the Senate. If they had not left the government then they would be seen as absolute pushovers unable to create consequences when others break deals with them.


[03-Sep-18 09:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
The truth is the PM should have called an election days ago when it was clear that he could no longer guarantee supply for bills in the Senate when the SSAF bill failed.


[03-Sep-18 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed, tbyrn did the right thing by removing himself, he has a fight on his hand this election and he was already copping unwarranted flak of being a Liberal in all but name only.


[03-Sep-18 09:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not sure how losing one bill means you have to resign


[03-Sep-18 09:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I think as we see now it was more reflective of a general government inability to pass anything through the Senate, as well as the total inactivity of many of their Senators.


[03-Sep-18 09:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
But yes, I agree Tbyrn did the right thing.

tbyrn feels very strongly about online gambling.


[03-Sep-18 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
and while I voted against it personally, I'm not against increase regulation in the area


[03-Sep-18 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm simply against the prohibition of most things.


[03-Sep-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbyrn felt as though the one bill he had the governments support on, the one thing holding him to the liberals, was thrown in the trash


[03-Sep-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
without explanation


[03-Sep-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's quite clear, he was told one thing in private, and experienced another in the senate, in public


[03-Sep-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
The PM and his party should not be trusted by any party, no matter the ideology

[03-Sep-18 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I do have to wonder if the Centre Alliance knew of this after all the Libs voted against it in the Lower house, presumably it would be expected they vote against it in the upper house. I do notice it passed the lower house with Labour support yet @Deleted User you and other Labour Senators voted against it. What was the change in party policy there?


[03-Sep-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
👀


[03-Sep-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Labour senate team were quite public in their opposition


[03-Sep-18 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
We believe curbing problem gambling of any kind is a laudable cause


[03-Sep-18 09:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yet the HoR team in support? Was it given a conscience vote? Or is there a split within the party?


[03-Sep-18 09:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
You ask the questions?


[03-Sep-18 09:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
The execution was off, and could have been done better


[03-Sep-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Though yes, Labour leadership afforded its members a free vote on the bill


[03-Sep-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed, I'm just curious now as to why this was the bill that he broke off support when the Liberal party voted against it in the Lower House


[03-Sep-18 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberal Party has advised they changed their position on the bill as a party


[03-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbryn was not advised


[03-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
We need a parliamentary whip.


[03-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
he was stunned


[03-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
But they were against it in the votes in the lower house, he already knew


[03-Sep-18 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Did support change and he was told then support went back against and he was not told?


[03-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberals did not support a government partners bill


[03-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
How could we expect tbyrn to continue to support the government?


[03-Sep-18 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed as I said earlier I am not aware of the inner workings and this is not the way I would run and indeed did not run a coalition.


[03-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the future, and certainly for Labour


[03-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would expect we'd be upfront and honest with our intentions with government partners


[03-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed.


[03-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
As well as proper cabinet procedure followed, something I have noticed not happen in the past few governments


[03-Sep-18 10:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
We'd outline bills we would support, and not support as part of any government dealings


[03-Sep-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Absolutely


[03-Sep-18 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
And if I may say so myself


[03-Sep-18 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
As a centrist in the ALP, I would hope we can work together in the next parliament on many bills


[03-Sep-18 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Who knows what will happen


[03-Sep-18 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed may the best candidates win

I have received a copy of the new Greens manifesto, being debated within the party room at the moment for adoption as their policy tome.


[07-Sep-18 10:08 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
It appears that the Agrarian Party, which released their own manifesto after initially subsuming the Greens in their previous incarnation, borrowed heavily from the in-progress Greens manifesto to complete their own, which Artichoke_Alex released to little fanfare.


[07-Sep-18 10:08 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Greenout is sharing the manifesto before it’s voted on by the Greens. Link here:

[07-Sep-18 10:10 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Highlights include a long-term economic planning aspiration, support for a republic, wholesale welfare reform, and a commitment to diplomatic non-alignment, something that should prove very controversial.


[07-Sep-18 10:10 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
Will the party membership be willing to approve what appears to be a quite left-wing manifesto?


[07-Sep-18 10:11 AM] phyllicanderer#1345
All will be told in time, no doubt.
