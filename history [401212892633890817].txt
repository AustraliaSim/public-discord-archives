This appears to not be a subscribably however


[12-Jan-18 01:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Seems like everyone is in it


[12-Jan-18 01:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I have no idea how they do that haha


[12-Jan-18 01:49 PM] Deleted User#0000

[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Anyway my question for today was about the use of the term "dark ages" is it still in usage or do people shy away from it because of negative connotations?


[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Catiline#0267
i just woke up from nap whats this


[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000

[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh yeah no one uses Dark ages


[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's just entirely wrong


[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Adrian Goldsworthy just used it in "PAx Romana"


[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
really?


[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah


[12-Jan-18 01:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
to describe the middle ages?


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
because there are a few other dark ages


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Catiline#0267
pax romana is the peace of rome though


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
like the Greek dark age


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Can we make this a subscribable


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm trying


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
@abiramen


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
"When Rome collapsed Europe sank into the Dark Ages, literacy and learning all but forgotten, and there was warfare and violence or every sort where once there had been peace"


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
for now, just mute it


[12-Jan-18 01:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's the sentence


[12-Jan-18 01:52 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
I can put it in with +forums


[12-Jan-18 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000

[12-Jan-18 01:52 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Oh sorry


[12-Jan-18 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Catiline well yeah but he is also talking about it in comparison to later historical periods


[12-Jan-18 01:53 PM] Deleted User 512350472#9529
Didnt see those last 2 messages


[12-Jan-18 01:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean, I'd guess in this context he means specifically the city of Rome


[12-Jan-18 01:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
but he says Europe


[12-Jan-18 01:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
so I dunno


[12-Jan-18 01:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's really weird


[12-Jan-18 01:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
And just demonstrably not true...


[12-Jan-18 01:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I read somewhere that some academics still say the EARLY Middle Ages was the dark ages


[12-Jan-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like really early


[12-Jan-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
So he could be referring to that?


[12-Jan-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think he's just being weird


[12-Jan-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
I haven't read his Pax Romana


[12-Jan-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
his work on Caesar was very good


[12-Jan-18 01:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah this one is very good also.. I guess I'll just let that weird sentence slide and carry on haha


[12-Jan-18 01:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Most historians of the middle ages don' consider them dark at all


[12-Jan-18 01:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
there wasn't really some loss of learning


[12-Jan-18 01:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah


[12-Jan-18 01:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also people exaggerated how many people were "lynched" by the church


[12-Jan-18 01:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Absolutely


[12-Jan-18 01:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
And like to think the church was this oppressive thing that obstructed academic learning


[12-Jan-18 01:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is one of those interesting areas too that shows the differences between study of classics and other areas of history


[12-Jan-18 01:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
there are a lot of classicists who still view civilisation after the fall of the western roman empire as a big of a cluster


[12-Jan-18 01:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
apparently he's one


[12-Jan-18 01:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
or he's just using it in a strange way


[12-Jan-18 01:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
also very likely


[12-Jan-18 01:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah it's not a very important sentence so I'm just going to forget about it


[12-Jan-18 01:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
I visited a new local library though. They had this and also this gigatinc Paul Keating biography


[12-Jan-18 01:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
So This is a pretty good library haha


[12-Jan-18 01:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I mean it's good to notice stuff like that, that's how you end up with actual good historical writing, when you spot stuff like that in primary sources


[12-Jan-18 01:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
ooo that does sound good


[12-Jan-18 02:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah it's a pretty small library but like half of it is social studies and history/geography so I was pretty impressed


[12-Jan-18 02:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
my local library has a terrible history section unfoirtunately


[12-Jan-18 02:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
all books about WWII and stuff


[12-Jan-18 02:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that is a problem with a lot of library


[12-Jan-18 02:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
*librarys


[12-Jan-18 02:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
A lot of "Hitlers last days" type history books


[12-Jan-18 02:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
haha yeah


[12-Jan-18 02:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
and all the crap by Peter FitzSimmons


[12-Jan-18 02:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Pretty much


[12-Jan-18 02:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
This one has a massive collection of pompeii books and some ones about Athens though so that was refreshing at leadt


[12-Jan-18 02:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe there was a historian on the staff who bought the books


[12-Jan-18 02:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Probably central coast libraries are pretty good all round


[12-Jan-18 02:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
A lot of local history at each one also


[12-Jan-18 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
I thought historians called them the dark ages because there isn't much contemporary sources from those times and so many events are dark


[12-Jan-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
that was sort of the argument that followed the original 'they were dakr because they were primitive'


[12-Jan-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
it's also not really true


[12-Jan-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
they've found a lot more source


[12-Jan-18 02:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
I like those ages, lot of shit happened. Rise of nations, power struggles etc.


[12-Jan-18 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah exactly


[12-Jan-18 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
not really dark


[12-Jan-18 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
No plus the whole the church stifled thing reeks of the anti-religion movement during the 18th and 19th centuries. Same reason why they changed the story as to why Columbus sailed west


[12-Jan-18 04:03 PM] John Galt#0449
Wasn't it to stop climate change?


[12-Jan-18 04:33 PM] Deleted User#0000

Question: Is there any reported cases of patricians reclassifying themselves as plebians so they could have access to the tribune of plebs role? (before it was weakened)


[22-Jan-18 10:12 AM] Catiline#0267
I remember something relating to that


[22-Jan-18 10:13 AM] Catiline#0267
Afaik patricians just funded plebians which favoured their views


[22-Jan-18 10:13 AM] Catiline#0267
also the period where it was weakened in the republic wasn't that long


[22-Jan-18 10:14 AM] Catiline#0267
Only really from the dictatorship of Sulla to the consulship of Pompey which was like


[22-Jan-18 10:14 AM] Catiline#0267
20ish years?


[22-Jan-18 10:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Interesting. Its just interesting how much power tribunes possessed.


[24-Jan-18 09:44 AM] Catiline#0267
It's always nice when the start of a book has a foreword about the context of a historian


[24-Jan-18 09:44 AM] Catiline#0267
And the context of their writings


[24-Jan-18 09:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
What're you reading?


[24-Jan-18 09:47 AM] Catiline#0267
Like this one mentioned that the author thought that theocratic movements in the English civil war weren't relevant when he wrote it in the 1970s so he barely wrote about them however since then there has been a rise in theocratic states in the middle east


[24-Jan-18 09:47 AM] Catiline#0267
"The world turned upside down: radical ideas during the English revolution"

Oh right cool


[24-Jan-18 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that is good. The one I'm reading has an intro from another historian saying that he didn't used to value this author, but as he grew as an historian he appreciated him more. But that this book isn't that historians best work

Also my Asia studies major can be based around history


[24-Jan-18 09:56 AM] Catiline#0267
It's entirely flexible on how you approach it


[24-Jan-18 09:56 AM] Catiline#0267
You could do an entire major just in sociology units or history ones


[24-Jan-18 09:58 AM] Catiline#0267
So idk, I might change it or just plan my units around Asian history


[24-Jan-18 10:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Could be fun, I haven't done a lot of Asian history

LAST week’s successful test of a North Korean missile raised fresh fears Australia is now potentially within range of one of the rogue nation’s nukes.

May 5th, 1947. Camp Mountain Rail Disaster.

The Camp Mountain rail Disaster is the worst rail accident in Queensland Rail History. 215 passengers were on board, 38 were injured and 16 died.

It was a picnic train for Department of Transport employees, the service was on the now closed Dayboro line, approximately 15 km north west of Brisbane.

The accident was caused due to a driver being unfamiliar with the line, causing the train to pick up speed when going downhill. The line had a speed limit of 40 km/h on straights and 32 km/h on curves. When the train hit the entered the curve, it was estimated to be going at 64 km/h, the train leaned to the right, left the rails and ploughed into the embankment. The first 3 carriages of the 6 carriage train telescoped, the tender upended, the water tank set free.

The Fireman was killed underneath the wheels of the train while the Driver was trapped between the boiler and the cab wall, being scolded by escaping steam, the driver died on the way to the hospital.

@RMSteve what do you think about the Federalist Party?

Adams set a precedent with his Alien and Sedition Acts that has allowed the government to violate the Constitution and civil liberties for history thereafter


[12-May-20 08:49 AM] SocialistAcid#2094
I take it you don't like Adams.
From what I understand, his non-partisan behaviour and constant fighting with Hamilton destroyed the party.

Despite having rejected the APA's petition, Prime Minister Joseph Lyons did agree to meet with the Day of Mourning leaders on 25 January, without any other government officials or media present. However, some media reports at the time attributed this more to Lyons' desire to meet Pastor Doug Nicholls, who was an Australian rules football player for Fitzroy Football Club at the time, than to any desire to constructively negotiate.[2]
