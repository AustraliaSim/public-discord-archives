i abused a hard drive once and it died on me

@Catiline I've tried telling so many people that AMD wouldn't be able to catch up if Intel didn't sit up on their money creating a monopoly but no one listens


[19-Jul-17 03:09 PM] Catiline#0267
yeah


[19-Jul-17 03:09 PM] Catiline#0267
Also, I think Intel thought they'd be able to sit still for longer


[19-Jul-17 03:09 PM] Catiline#0267
Their i9 chips are basically just rebadged xeons


[19-Jul-17 03:10 PM] abiramen#1521
Yep


[19-Jul-17 03:10 PM] abiramen#1521
With a bit of consumer optimisation


[19-Jul-17 03:10 PM] abiramen#1521
Thankfully Intel should be moving to a smaller architecture pretty soon


[19-Jul-17 03:11 PM] abiramen#1521
With Cannonlake


[19-Jul-17 03:13 PM] abiramen#1521
I doubt we'll be getting smaller than 8nm in the near future because manufacturing accuracy has its limits and electrons can be ripped across small distances quite easily @Catiline


[19-Jul-17 03:13 PM] abiramen#1521
I think after that point we'll be waiting on some kind of quantum architecture


[19-Jul-17 03:14 PM] Catiline#0267
Nah. There's a few CPU architectures that could be implemented, it just costs more then simply shrinking the transistor size


[19-Jul-17 03:14 PM] abiramen#1521
Ah yes


[19-Jul-17 03:14 PM] abiramen#1521
Improve the actual computational design

Instead of the actual transistors


[19-Jul-17 03:15 PM] Catiline#0267
My bf's a software engineer, apparently the way CPUs work atm are fairly inefficient compared to other designs

Ooh nice


[19-Jul-17 03:16 PM] abiramen#1521
That being said current designs probably are used for one main reason


[19-Jul-17 03:16 PM] abiramen#1521
Thermal efficiency


[19-Jul-17 03:16 PM] abiramen#1521
I think other designs would cause a thermal overload


[19-Jul-17 03:17 PM] abiramen#1521

[19-Jul-17 03:17 PM] abiramen#1521
@Catiline


[19-Jul-17 03:19 PM] Catiline#0267
If thermal efficiency was a problem, intel would use proper materials in between the processor and the processor lid


[19-Jul-17 03:19 PM] Catiline#0267
The stuff they put in is pretty bad


[19-Jul-17 03:19 PM] abiramen#1521
I think there was a video on the Techquickie YouTube channel regarding thermal efficiency

Elderly lady. Has NBN. No mobile reception. Worried about safety now she can't use land line in emergency. • r/australia
I know an elderly, frail lady. She had her internet changed to NBN. She has since found out that if the power goes out she can't make calls....

"The easy choice was to join the proprietary software world, signing nondisclosure agreements and promising not to help my fellow hacker. Most likely I would also be developing software that was released under nondisclosure agreements, thus adding to the pressure on other people to betray their fellows too. I could have made money this way, and perhaps amused myself writing code. But I knew that at the end of my career, I would look back on years of building walls to divide people, and feel I had spent my life making the world a worse place." - Richard Stallman

Which is the frequency that can reach our house


[02-Aug-17 02:12 PM] Scrub#3915
Yeah, I don't think your repeater is the problem


[02-Aug-17 02:12 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
My aunt has been complaining how she doesn't get the connection


[02-Aug-17 02:12 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I think she actually hates me


[02-Aug-17 02:12 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
And her brother too


[02-Aug-17 02:13 PM] Scrub#3915
So even after turning off the repeater, they still get these connectivity issues?


[02-Aug-17 02:13 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Monetary problem o guess


[02-Aug-17 02:13 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Yeah more or less


[02-Aug-17 02:13 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
The connection has been funny since I got back


[02-Aug-17 02:14 PM] Scrub#3915
How far are they from the router?


[02-Aug-17 02:14 PM] Scrub#3915
And do they connect to the 2.4GHz band?


[02-Aug-17 02:14 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Roughly 10m


[02-Aug-17 02:14 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Yes


[02-Aug-17 02:14 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I'm 20 straight line


[02-Aug-17 02:14 PM] Scrub#3915
Shouldn't be an issue. Have they tried the 5GHz band anyway?


[02-Aug-17 02:15 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Doesn't reach


[02-Aug-17 02:15 PM] Scrub#3915
Wow


[02-Aug-17 02:15 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
The brother set it as dual band


[02-Aug-17 02:15 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
So it reads whichever is best


[02-Aug-17 02:15 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
And it's usually 2.4


[02-Aug-17 02:17 PM] Scrub#3915
Most people in my house use the ~~2.4GHz~~ 5GHz band as they're close and don't have to penetrate as many walls, but I have to use the ~~5GHz~~ 2.4GHz band as I'm a bit away and have 6~ walls to penetrate


[02-Aug-17 02:17 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Wait


[02-Aug-17 02:17 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
What


[02-Aug-17 02:17 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I thought the 5GHz is weaker through walls


[02-Aug-17 02:18 PM] Scrub#3915
I don't even get the 2.4GHz signal at my room...


[02-Aug-17 02:19 PM] Scrub#3915
I think my router's messed as I have two SSIDs, one which says 5GHz, and one which says 2.4GHz


[02-Aug-17 02:20 PM] Scrub#3915
Switch what I said (2.4 and 5) around 😛


[02-Aug-17 02:22 PM] Scrub#3915
Do you think you could invest into long Ethernet cables?


[02-Aug-17 02:22 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
No


[02-Aug-17 02:22 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I don't think they would like that


[02-Aug-17 02:22 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
They wouldn't be too happy about it


[02-Aug-17 02:22 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
They already dislike me


[02-Aug-17 02:23 PM] Scrub#3915
Damn :c


[02-Aug-17 02:23 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Probably complained to my uncle because I don't pay for the internet


[02-Aug-17 02:24 PM] Scrub#3915
Do they get connectivity issues when there's no walls and they're in direct sight to the router?


[02-Aug-17 02:25 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Not that I know of previously


[02-Aug-17 02:28 PM] Scrub#3915
You should try some tests with one of your devices, such as two tests with and w/o your repeater on going from direct sight of the router to 1,2,3+ walls from the router


[02-Aug-17 02:34 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
It doesn't reach my room


[02-Aug-17 02:34 PM] LividMilkTea#7622

[02-Aug-17 06:10 PM] Scrub#3915

They tried to kick you off @LividMilkTea ?


[02-Aug-17 07:52 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Made it hidden


[02-Aug-17 07:53 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Devices don't automatically connect to hidden networks even if it matches the password


[02-Aug-17 07:53 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
For the first time


[02-Aug-17 07:53 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
You do it once and it'll automatically connect afterwards


[02-Aug-17 07:54 PM] Scrub#3915
Do you know why the hid the SSID?


[02-Aug-17 08:18 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Nope

Tired of the LNPs tricks to make FTTN and FTTP seem the same with their CVC prices


[19-Aug-17 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
FTTP has 4 ports on the NTD


[19-Aug-17 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
each port I believe can do 2.5Gbps ?


[19-Aug-17 08:25 PM] Scrub#3915
Same with Sky Muster and Fixed Wireless


[19-Aug-17 08:25 PM] Scrub#3915
Except the speeds 😛


[19-Aug-17 08:25 PM] Scrub#3915
That's a bottleneck for FTTP too

[19-Aug-17 08:28 PM] Scrub#3915
Have you tried using a VPN in Singapore so it uses Singapore's CDNs and not Australia's on Steam?

I can't say how Private Internet Access will perform on gigabit speeds

On my 25Mb/s speeds it's fine, but yeah, those speeds are trash


[19-Aug-17 08:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Whats the point of having 1Gbps internet when the VPN *seems* to be limited to 5Mbps


[19-Aug-17 08:29 PM] Scrub#3915
PIA's faster than 5Mb/s


[19-Aug-17 08:31 PM] Scrub#3915
I hope when Labor wins the next election (maybe I shouldn't get ahead of myself, he media's a powerful thing), they'll go back to FTTP


[19-Aug-17 08:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think they said they couldn't


[19-Aug-17 08:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
at least not the same scale


[19-Aug-17 08:31 PM] Scrub#3915
It'll be cheaper in the long run to immediately end FTTN, HFC and everything else the LNP added


[19-Aug-17 08:31 PM] Scrub#3915
Can't they just override the contracts? Or will that be challenged?

[19-Aug-17 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
If the government lowered the wholesale charges there would be the demand for 1Gbps

Yup


[19-Aug-17 08:33 PM] Scrub#3915
All the more reason to cripple the FTTP and then say it should be removed and replaced with FTTN

Can an Army of Bitcoin "Bounty Hunters" Deter Pirates? - TorrentFreak
Anti-piracy organizations have come up with a wide variety of measures to combat copyright infringement over the years, with varying results. Enlisting the public to track down pirates in exchange for Bitcoin bounties is one of the more exotic ways, but according to eBook publisher Erudition, it's a great way to tackle this growing problem. And they're not alone.

It had a grill on the top below the bezel


[27-Sep-17 07:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
and there was an electrical arch going on every now and then


[27-Sep-17 07:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
eventually my monitor just died, and I assume the flashing had something to do with it

[16-Oct-17 12:23 PM] Scrub#3915
Like in Japan?


[16-Oct-17 12:23 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
For example in Canada and Japan, there are two bird noises representing the direction you're crossing

I'm for it


[16-Oct-17 12:23 PM] LividMilkTea#7622

[16-Oct-17 12:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
the button to activate has feedback


[16-Oct-17 12:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
it makes a noise to tell to cross, and to stop


[16-Oct-17 12:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
and in the city the edges have bumps


[16-Oct-17 12:24 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Currently they don't tell what direction the person is crossing


[16-Oct-17 12:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
they're crossing across the road


[16-Oct-17 12:25 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I'm talking about the ones at intersections


[16-Oct-17 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh, then the button will start beeping


[16-Oct-17 12:25 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
As they have multiple directions


[16-Oct-17 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
so you put your finger on it until it gives you the go signal


[16-Oct-17 12:25 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
N, E, S, W


[16-Oct-17 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
and it has an arrow telling you which way


[16-Oct-17 12:26 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Just where the road is relative to the post


[16-Oct-17 12:26 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Not the actual direction relative to bearins


[16-Oct-17 12:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
but it's irrelevant, as it already  has the necessary signals to tell a blind person when to go


[16-Oct-17 12:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
the extra noise would just be another thing


[16-Oct-17 12:26 PM] Deleted User#0000

[16-Oct-17 12:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm just saying it's already there

When, but not really where


[16-Oct-17 12:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
that's why you touch the button


[16-Oct-17 12:27 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
It's good


[16-Oct-17 12:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
because it tells you where


[16-Oct-17 12:27 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
But it needs to be better


[16-Oct-17 12:27 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I.e. two traffic light tones


[16-Oct-17 12:28 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
So that one can acknowledge they're crossing NS or EW


[16-Oct-17 12:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
It'd be good to supliment


[16-Oct-17 12:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
but obviously it could never replace touch


[16-Oct-17 12:34 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
Yes indeed


[16-Oct-17 12:34 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I just thought about that


[16-Oct-17 12:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ideally making the dots that mark edges of roads provide feedbacl


[16-Oct-17 12:36 PM] LividMilkTea#7622
I was mainly into guiding those in need to the NS/EW direction as we lack the facilities for these at the moment

The informal report from the RFC 1149 event
Finally, rfc 1149 is implemented! On saturday 28th of april 2001, the worlds very first rfc 1149 network was tested. The weather was quite nice, despite being in one of the most rainy places in Norway.
The ping was started approximately at 12:15. We decided to do a 7 1/2 minute interval between the ping packets, that would leave a couple of packets unanswered, given ideal situations. Things didn’t happen quite that way, though.

LPT: If ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for "free", search for "open source" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware • r/LifeProTips
The reasoning being if you type "free", generally you will be advertised to or get the LITE version which will only have some of the functionality...

@abiramen yeah, I haven't implemented preferential voting yet but will definitely do so - have validation already in place for approval voting, will be easy to adapt

I just ported my winforms app to wpf, it was my first time using wpf


[28-Dec-17 12:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
holy fuck it was hard at first, but once you learn all of the tags and memorize the differrent property names, its a lot better


[28-Dec-17 08:46 AM] Scrub#3915
Yeah, Winforms are pretty old


[28-Dec-17 02:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I was faking material design pretty hard with winforms @Scrub

Hmm, when you pass in the currency argument in the methods inside of Prices.cs, you could possibly have an error if the API doesn't know what the currency is


[28-Dec-17 03:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yep, thats true


[28-Dec-17 03:22 PM] Scrub#3915
So, maybe have enums or something?


[28-Dec-17 03:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, I was thinking that


[28-Dec-17 03:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
eventually ill let users input custom currencies


[28-Dec-17 03:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
so ill definitely need some error handling for that


[28-Dec-17 03:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
if they type USDD by accident, Ill make it say "currency not supported"


[28-Dec-17 03:23 PM] Scrub#3915
Indeed

Yeah, validating user input is fun 😛

[28-Dec-17 03:52 PM] Scrub#3915
Right, it's built. I like the look of it, though I'm not sure if it's my VM, but there's some lag when clicking on the radio buttons


[28-Dec-17 03:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
nah, thats not you


[28-Dec-17 03:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
its because it does a web request for the prices when you press it


[28-Dec-17 03:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I should probably put the buttons on a seperate thread or something


[28-Dec-17 03:53 PM] Scrub#3915
Yeah, or maybe have it asynchronous and display a loading loop on the page while it loads?


[28-Dec-17 03:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
that could work


[28-Dec-17 03:55 PM] Scrub#3915
But yeah, your UI's looking very good so far


[28-Dec-17 03:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
ty 😄


[28-Dec-17 03:57 PM] Scrub#3915
You'll need some more error handling for edge cases, such as "The remote server returned an error: (502) Bad Gateway."


[28-Dec-17 03:58 PM] Scrub#3915
That occurs on every line with 'bitcoinPrice = client.DownloadString'

[28-Dec-17 03:58 PM] Scrub#3915
Okay


[28-Dec-17 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
yep, definitely gonna need some handling on that, the app just freezes up when it tries to refresh

You obviously have a lot of experience with these verification issues. In terms of building an Open Democracy Platform which prevents/minimises these problems, our preference is to find the right people with the right combination of skills and build something great together. We have a very good equity sharing model (Slicing Pie), which we'd like to use to build and reward a team

That's a good question. Blockchain is still very new and most activity is around finance / cryptocurrency, but I think there will many more 'social' applications in future, such as buying and selling 'value' such as ideas. It's still very early. I also think that democracy around the world is in trouble in it's current centralised form and blockchain could be a way of decentralising democracy so it's more accessible to the wider population, not just the privileged few connected to lobby groups.

Yes, that's my idea. I'm very interested in Australian politics. Also, what we've done is a very basic Candidate / Voter two-sided platform where Candidates compete for votes based on the popularity of their policies. Then, the top Candidates can propose Referendums. We had always thought that future iterations could include parties , electorates, and both houses of parliament....

hmm it looks like about 10% are dying each generation because I get draws and so the draws dont ever breed. not sure how to handle draws

@droniye✌🏼 do you have any idea of how i can handle draws?


[07-May-19 12:04 PM] Rat#1042
like should i kill both the bots that draw or keep them both alive?


[07-May-19 12:05 PM] Rat#1042
or randomly kill one of them?


[07-May-19 12:05 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
IDK


[07-May-19 12:05 PM] droniye✌🏼#0948
not that experienced yet


[07-May-19 12:06 PM] Rat#1042
hmm


[07-May-19 12:10 PM] Rat#1042
@Napoleon Freeze what do you think would be the optimum choice to make?


[07-May-19 12:17 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
well afaik with noughts and crosses, a draw as player 2 is a win, as your aim is to not lose


[07-May-19 12:18 PM] Rat#1042
oh wait really?


[07-May-19 12:18 PM] Rat#1042
oh okay that makes it a lot easier


[07-May-19 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
two perfect players will tie


[07-May-19 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
so if a bot loses, kill it


[07-May-19 12:18 PM] Rat#1042
that does make sense, alright ill kill playerA if its a draw


[07-May-19 12:18 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
but if a bot dies, thats probs a sign that both bots are ok


[07-May-19 12:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
no if its a tie, kill neither


[07-May-19 12:19 PM] Rat#1042
oh uhh okay, ill just put both back in


[07-May-19 12:19 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
yeah, just treat draw as a 'not lose'


[07-May-19 12:29 PM] Rat#1042
i won this game, but it actually didnt do too bad

> According to a patent picked up by PatentlyApple, Apple has been working on a version of the Apple Pencil that contains new color-sensing hardware. This would enable the user to copy a color from a real-world object and then immediately start drawing with that exact color on the iPad or iPhone.
