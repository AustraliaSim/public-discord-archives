Okay in all seriousness @Parliamentarian if you need any help with legislation and the formation of it, just write in here. It will not matter in any case if you post a bill in here, because it will be posted as part of business and should not be a big secret anyway. I will work on making a more visual guide towards creating legislation for you guys.

Sweet


[15-Aug-22 11:54 AM] High Priest Liam#6655
I'm gonna attempt a bill that makes it so every veteran under an income threshold is given a house.


[15-Aug-22 11:54 AM] High Priest Liam#6655
I've never written a bill that effects the budget before so that's gonna be a mess


[15-Aug-22 11:55 AM] 12MaxWild#6477
A sound bill idea !


[15-Aug-22 11:55 AM] Wanuke#5929
to do something like that you probably have to organize it through a ministry


[15-Aug-22 11:55 AM] Wanuke#5929
hmm


[15-Aug-22 11:55 AM] 12MaxWild#6477
If it affects the budget I think you just need the EM to say something about financial impact


[15-Aug-22 11:55 AM] Wanuke#5929
and, be in government

[15-Aug-22 11:55 AM] 12MaxWild#6477
I learnt that the long way round


[15-Aug-22 01:06 PM] NGSpy#8096
So fun facts: there are two types of appropriations in Australia: Annual Appropriations and Special Appropriations.
Acts with special appropriations (I believe that the *Veterans Entitlements Act 1986* is one of them), the deal is that if you amend it, it will automatically affect the budget without you having to do anything, as the bill appropriates the amount automatically.


[15-Aug-22 01:06 PM] NGSpy#8096
this is the same with the *Social Security (Administration) Act 1999* which is interconnected with the *Social Security Act 1991*


[15-Aug-22 01:06 PM] NGSpy#8096
and some other stuff


[15-Aug-22 01:07 PM] NGSpy#8096
Correct. The EM provides a table which allows you to input 5 years of financial impact, and I suggest you do that.


[15-Aug-22 01:12 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
So I can just alter the veteran entitlements act?


[15-Aug-22 01:20 PM] NGSpy#8096
Exactly!


[15-Aug-22 01:20 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Epic


[15-Aug-22 01:20 PM] NGSpy#8096
ill double check tho üôÇ


[15-Aug-22 01:26 PM] NGSpy#8096
@High Priest Liam yeah, amend away at the Veterans Entitlement Act 1986. The relevant section for appropriations is section 199, so I would double check that your amendments are covered under that section to ensure that it gets automatically appropriated.

what are you trying to do liam

Hello, I will be helping out here.


[15-Aug-22 06:10 PM] NGSpy#8096
He's trying to give Veterans under an income threshold a house


[15-Aug-22 06:18 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
And I mean all veterans. If you don't have proof of service and are homeless then the government will be required to do diligence to find your service history.

**VERY USEFUL LEGISLATION ADVICE NO.1**
Whenever a bill amends another bill, repealing the amending bill does not get rid of the amendments. All it does is get rid of the bill. Once the schedules of an amending bill commences, it gets applied permanently to the bill it amends until it gets amended by another bill.
If you want to repeal amendments to another bill, you have to amend the amendments back to what it was before.
It's simple, stupid!
