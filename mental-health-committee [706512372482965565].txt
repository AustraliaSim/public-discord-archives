Why is the call called the mental health committee thing then?

I dont believe the treasurer will be joining us today so I guess we will begin *shrugs*


[07-May-20 03:39 PM] inactive#6974
Or the Deputy PM?


[07-May-20 03:40 PM] JAYDEN#5487
No I do not think he will join us either


[07-May-20 03:40 PM] JAYDEN#5487
But just want to quickly thank the Government for this position, it means a lot, and thank the SDP for continuing our great relationship, no matter where my political life is.


[07-May-20 03:40 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: I want water, ill be back)


[07-May-20 03:41 PM] inactive#6974
A policy is a policy, no matter who it comes from.


[07-May-20 03:43 PM] NGSpy#8096
Hear hear!


[07-May-20 03:46 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Almost the line but not quite


[07-May-20 03:47 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Anyways, I've gathered you here today to talk about the future of Australia's Mental Health. As we know with this pandemic, it is creating many mental problems and many experts are saying there will be a big spike in suicide rates


[07-May-20 03:47 PM] JAYDEN#5487
as someone who has a background in suicide advocacy, it is important we act now


[07-May-20 03:47 PM] inactive#6974
I concur.


[07-May-20 03:48 PM] NGSpy#8096
I concur as well.


[07-May-20 03:48 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Already this year we saw the Youth Suicide Prevention taskforce created, Mr @Prime Minister, has the Health Department created that taskforce?


[07-May-20 03:49 PM] NGSpy#8096
I feel that during this COVID-19 crisis that it is important for the government to provide more places that can help make it better, and also to acknowledge that many people who have had previous mental health conditions will relapse to the point of needing an appointment with a psychologist or psychiatrist.


[07-May-20 03:52 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I agree


[07-May-20 03:52 PM] inactive#6974
I would also like to contribute by raising the attention regarding domestic violence. There have been reports of partners using the pandemic to abuse their partners, as we are stuck inside. There was a case where one said they had been in contact with a covid-19 infectious person, and forced their partner to isolate with them for 14 days. In Victoria there has been increased police, checking homes that they consider to be at high risk, to ensure that people are safe.


[07-May-20 03:53 PM] inactive#6974
It is important that people suffering from domestic violence have somewhere to reach out, as with the pandemic, it is difficult to.


[07-May-20 03:54 PM] JAYDEN#5487
As someone who has dealt with domestic violence, I 100% agree


[07-May-20 03:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
*connects*


[07-May-20 03:55 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I would also like to see an increase in school programs, expecially with home based learning, it is getting to the youth's mental health ontop of all their social issue


[07-May-20 03:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
If the mental health ambassador were to make a bill to survey the current mental health facilities in Australia and also seek to implement government mental health facilities (the facilities being psychiatric offices or pyschological offices)


[07-May-20 03:55 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Welcome Mr Griffo


[07-May-20 03:55 PM] inactive#6974

[07-May-20 03:56 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Um, I am going to ignore that comment


[07-May-20 03:57 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Okay


[07-May-20 03:57 PM] inactive#6974
Hmm, yes. Disappointing, considering how well behaved and open the PM has been.


[07-May-20 03:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
I am very open to mental health advocacy and it’s an issue of extreme importance


[07-May-20 03:58 PM] JAYDEN#5487
To go onwith the Shadow Ministers comments, I think a directive to consider more police checkups is very useful


[07-May-20 03:59 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I also think having extra safe spaces at places such as courthouses where trained professionals are there to help people with domestic violence may be beneficial


[07-May-20 03:59 PM] inactive#6974
I fully agree.


[07-May-20 04:00 PM] NGSpy#8096
I agree as well.


[07-May-20 04:01 PM] ripauntmay#0083
As long as social distancing and virus prevention measures are followed I am sure something can be arranged.


[07-May-20 04:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Agreed


[07-May-20 04:02 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Of course


[07-May-20 04:03 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Now the bill that was passed last term was passed after the budget came out, Mr Treasurer, can you elaborate on how funding will be spend for the Youth Suicide Prevention Taskforce?


[07-May-20 04:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well funding will need to be appropriated to ensure that the Task Force remains running, with state partnerships to be made


[07-May-20 04:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the draft budget currently, it has been addressed and the funding will be granted in its full capacities, however I am awaiting commentary from the Minister of Health as to a more coherent plan


[07-May-20 04:05 PM] inactive#6974
Understood.


[07-May-20 04:06 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I would have liked the Minister for Health to be here, it is unfortunate that he isn't here


[07-May-20 04:06 PM] NGSpy#8096
Understood. Will you supply a bill for the special appropriation that you will create?


[07-May-20 04:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is that directed to me?


[07-May-20 04:07 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I believe it is


[07-May-20 04:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
The bill has been created, special appropriations will be shown in the new budget to be introduced on budget night in later May


[07-May-20 04:10 PM] NGSpy#8096
Dr. Williamson, since you wrote the bill, could one remind the mental health committee how much the youth task force should be appropriated to properly fund it?


[07-May-20 04:11 PM] NGSpy#8096
(M: oof sorry for misnaming it again 😦 )


[07-May-20 04:11 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: I am Dr. Williamson)


[07-May-20 04:11 PM] NGSpy#8096
(M: i know)


[07-May-20 04:12 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I never included an amount, it is at the discretion of the minister, However I would feel that the best course of action would be to introduce this at a community level, so at a council level. I mean truthfully I don't know how to best do that but I feel like an amount of money to each council would be better than a state level so more action can be completed


[07-May-20 04:12 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Obviously the amount of money per LGA would vary


[07-May-20 04:13 PM] NGSpy#8096
Thank you for that clarification.


[07-May-20 04:14 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Now in terms of this, I think also looking to expand the program to other at risk individuals would be beneficial in due course.


[07-May-20 04:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Mr. Mental Health Man, can I ask how much $100,000 will go in promoting positive mental health on a local level


[07-May-20 04:14 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I think however, a report should be collated by the Health Department regarding Mental Health and Suicide Prevention


[07-May-20 04:15 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: bruh dont ask me)


[07-May-20 04:15 PM] JAYDEN#5487
To Promote Mental Health? A long way


[07-May-20 04:16 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I know in my personal council, a report is getting introduced on Monday night to talk about the Mental Health awareness month in October, RUOkayDay? and World Suicide Prevention Day and what we will do there


[07-May-20 04:17 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: hehe im the one who made them do that)


[07-May-20 04:17 PM] inactive#6974
(M: nice)


[07-May-20 04:17 PM] JAYDEN#5487
so I think 100k is a huge amount of money to invest into councils, and a step in the right direction


[07-May-20 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Excellent


[07-May-20 04:18 PM] JAYDEN#5487
and obviously we also have the 100k invested into the National Suicide Prevention Conference, so both are good money well spent


[07-May-20 04:18 PM] inactive#6974
I agree that 100k would do well. It is important that there are resources in place, so people struggling with mental health have somewhere to seek help.


[07-May-20 04:19 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yes exactly


[07-May-20 04:19 PM] JAYDEN#5487
If we could go onto individual initiatives


[07-May-20 04:19 PM] JAYDEN#5487
As earlier mentioned, I have a initiative to invest into schools


[07-May-20 04:20 PM] inactive#6974
I personally believe that more funding is necessary, to spread this across Australia, and costings would have to be researched.


[07-May-20 04:20 PM] NGSpy#8096
Hear here.


[07-May-20 04:20 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I agree


[07-May-20 04:21 PM] JAYDEN#5487
So in conjunction with the Minister for Health and Education, if we put this initiative in place, it could widely help schools communicate with their students.


[07-May-20 04:22 PM] inactive#6974
I am interested in this proposal.


[07-May-20 04:22 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I would suggest putting a trial into 50 schools in stage 1, and then start slowly adding them to other schools with the States help


[07-May-20 04:23 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: I literally have the website rn slater but its a big doxx bc it has my school and stuff)


[07-May-20 04:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, I have concerns with certain school based programs and must ensure that they have no irrelevant materials in them


[07-May-20 04:24 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Such as?


[07-May-20 04:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would oppose radical programs such as ‘Safe Schools’ from being implemented as they do not focus on improving mental health whatsoever, instead opting to promote various agendas


[07-May-20 04:26 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Agreed


[07-May-20 04:27 PM] JAYDEN#5487
My professional opinion is that Safe Schools increases the welfare for targeted youth


[07-May-20 04:27 PM] JAYDEN#5487
But this program is for all students to increase communication


[07-May-20 04:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
Safe Schools is not as radical as the treasurer might describe.


[07-May-20 04:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
It is a good program that should be fully implemented to assist our youth.


[07-May-20 04:27 PM] ripauntmay#0083
I respectfully disagree


[07-May-20 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
I disagree. It is a program designed to make progress in promoting a Marxist agenda and undermining our children


[07-May-20 04:28 PM] ripauntmay#0083
Hear hear


[07-May-20 04:29 PM] inactive#6974
I fail to see how a program that is focused on increasing LGBT and promotes mental health, teaches about the principles and economics of Marx.


[07-May-20 04:30 PM] inactive#6974
It doesn't mention economics at all. I also fail to see how it undermining our children.


[07-May-20 04:30 PM] JAYDEN#5487
If I may, this meeting is not for a political purpose


[07-May-20 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
In quoting the founder Roz Ward


[07-May-20 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
“Marxism offers both the hope and the strategy needed to create a world where human sexuality, gender and how we can relate to our bodies can blossom in extraordinarily new and amazing ways that we can only imagine today...It is through a revitalised class struggle and revolutionary change that we can hope for the liberation of the LGBTI people.”


[07-May-20 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
““Safe Schools is about supporting gender and sexual diversity, not about stopping bullying”


[07-May-20 04:31 PM] NGSpy#8096
Gentlemen, I feel that labelling programs with political labels won't get us anywhere in this meeting.


[07-May-20 04:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
My point is, there are more stronger programs that can uplift mental help and promote equality such as the Yale developed RULER program


[07-May-20 04:32 PM] inactive#6974
This debate is to be had another time.


[07-May-20 04:33 PM] JAYDEN#5487
going back to my original point


[07-May-20 04:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
There is no debate. We will fully support and fund programs which uplift mental health and promote anti-bullying; not programs which seek to undermine our children and promote a radical agenda


[07-May-20 04:33 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Back to my original point


[07-May-20 04:34 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I am happy to advise the government on how we can better change safe schools to turn it into a program that does mitigate bullying for the LGBT community at another time, but back to my proposal


[07-May-20 04:34 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: Let me get my speech up from last year)


[07-May-20 04:38 PM] JAYDEN#5487
So, with the website, per school there is going to be a committee of about 15 which includes counsellors and a panel of teachers and student leaders that will be in command of the website. They will have the authority to ban, mute and restrict members. To ensure they can use the resources provided correctly, because there are a lot, committee training will be run, and will show how to use all the admin resources. This way the platform is maximising its potential.

On the website there are a bunch of features, but the main 4 are: the forum, the blog, reporting and bookings.


[07-May-20 04:39 PM] JAYDEN#5487
The forum is where like minded students can connect and discuss issues they are facing and find people to help them get through the problem they are facing in their life. You can talk about things going on in your personal life, school life etc. All posts and comments are monitored by the team to ensure is appropriate and responsible.

The blog is essentially a news source. It has updates, announcements and personal testimonies posted by our team. The team will put up articles about things that are needed to know to get through life, for example what to do if you have suicidal thoughts. This is going to take a different approach to these big cases, with a student’s perspective contrary to a professional. The blog will also showcase personal stories and struggles students are facing, to show that you are not alone, there are people out there experiencing the same thing.

The reporting system function is a system where you can talk to the team about issues such as suicidal thoughts, mental health issues, cyber bullying, death threats etc. It sits in the bottom right of the screen and it’s that red chat button right there. When reporting, your name will not be included in the reports. 

And finally, is the booking service. The booking service is a service where you can book sessions with the counselor's, students or teachers. If you are having an upsetting time, there is always someone to help you. Students can be particularly helpful if you want someone that understands you to talk to you.


[07-May-20 04:40 PM] JAYDEN#5487
While creating this proposal, my team had to keep many things in mind because there are a lot of things most students don’t feel comfortable with. Many things happen in todays school. Lets say for instance a person was bullying someone constantly. With this platform, a bystander can report that to the staff so action can be taken. My team understand that sometimes people want to stick up for others but do not want to do it publicly and we kept that in mind when creating this platform.


[07-May-20 04:40 PM] JAYDEN#5487
That is a quick run down, I will put out a comprehensive report soon


[07-May-20 04:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
I do not believe it is healthy for students to publicly discuss these issues with each other online


[07-May-20 04:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
With professionals, yes


[07-May-20 04:42 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I disagree


[07-May-20 04:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
We do not need a chat room for M rated materials to be spread publicly and students to use this ammunition to bully and harass each other


[07-May-20 04:42 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I am not suggesting they ask each other for opinions on what to do, but to talk to peers about what they are going through creates dialogue which is healthy


[07-May-20 04:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
If they wish to discuss what they are going through, I would be open for them to do it face to face, with friends and family that they trust


[07-May-20 04:43 PM] NGSpy#8096
Those who have mental health issues feel comfortable talking to other kids with mental health issues as well. It's like a commonality.


[07-May-20 04:43 PM] JAYDEN#5487
yes


[07-May-20 04:43 PM] JAYDEN#5487
and one extra safeguard i have added in is not making the forum public


[07-May-20 04:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
Sometimes they don't want to talk to their family about it though, because their family is intolerant of mental health issues and plays off depression as a minor thing.


[07-May-20 04:44 PM] JAYDEN#5487
(M: actually i just remembered this feature because ihad the same concern griffo)


[07-May-20 04:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
How do people to talk to each other if there is no chat room


[07-May-20 04:44 PM] JAYDEN#5487
So when my team designed the platform, I saw a problem with making it public for everyone in the world to see


[07-May-20 04:45 PM] JAYDEN#5487
What my team has now created as a workaround are groups


[07-May-20 04:45 PM] JAYDEN#5487
The groups can be stuff like people with Anxiety, Depression, LGBTQIA+ or even a youth reference group. Government organisations like Headspace advocate for these types of groups to start dialogue


[07-May-20 04:46 PM] JAYDEN#5487
to see these groups, you would have to request for that group and a approved staff member will have to accept that child in


[07-May-20 04:46 PM] inactive#6974
You can have one on one confidential meetings too?


[07-May-20 04:47 PM] JAYDEN#5487
You can have whatever you like


[07-May-20 04:47 PM] JAYDEN#5487
They can be set to public, private or password protected


[07-May-20 04:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Is there a vetting system for the students


[07-May-20 04:48 PM] inactive#6974
Yes, the Treasurer raises a good point.


[07-May-20 04:49 PM] JAYDEN#5487
As I said, an approved staff member would have to accept the user if it is set to private


[07-May-20 04:50 PM] JAYDEN#5487
depending on school policies, they could have to speak to the welfare team to see if they fit into the group or whatever the schools policies are

Would it not be discrimination if we deny a child from the gay, anxiety or depression chats, especially if they are known to be provocative and hateful


[07-May-20 04:50 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Elaborate?


[07-May-20 04:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Let’s say I am a bully


[07-May-20 04:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I am to seek a new target


[07-May-20 04:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
What measures would be taken to prevent me from claiming to be gay or have depression to be accepted into a discussion or forum, grab some of the mature comments made by children at risk and use them to harass and bully kids


[07-May-20 04:53 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Well as I previously stated, if they are not diagnosed with depression then there is no place for them in the depression chat


[07-May-20 04:53 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Additionally, if they have been a bully, they would get reported through this system by a child of the school


[07-May-20 04:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Many children are not diagnosed with depression yet suffer from it


[07-May-20 04:54 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Furthermore, as I previously stated, the people running the website includes students, and the reason for this is because the children know the bullies more than the teachers and can greatly assist from the students help


[07-May-20 04:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well if students are running these pages, would there be institutionalised discrimination amongst groups to deny certain people?


[07-May-20 04:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
How can we prevent that?


[07-May-20 05:00 PM] inactive#6974
You raise good points.


[07-May-20 05:01 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Again, it varies on the school and the policies they wish to adopt, and I will bring these points up with my team but to explain futher


[07-May-20 05:02 PM] JAYDEN#5487
The committee is of 15 people, most of which would be the principal, deputy principal, welfare team, counsellors and other teachers, *as well as* Students, preferably leaders or other trusted pupils, to assist the staff with problems such as what is accurate or not


[07-May-20 05:03 PM] JAYDEN#5487
To use an example, if someone is making an allegation that someone has bullied every student for a year, but very clearly isnt true, then the report can be turned away


[07-May-20 05:04 PM] JAYDEN#5487
and many schools are already on this path, interviewing the victim and the reporter and the suspect, but this model also incorperates a students understanding as well


[07-May-20 05:04 PM] JAYDEN#5487
additionally, I know that Headspace run these type of programs as a third party, and is already a wide range of solutions regarding these types of things


[07-May-20 05:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmmm, I am not confident in a program with easily nameable flaws


[07-May-20 05:05 PM] NGSpy#8096
What do you feel should be done to counter those said flaws?


[07-May-20 05:06 PM] NGSpy#8096
And also what flaws do you feel is extremely present?


[07-May-20 05:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I wish to see a more concrete plan as to how the system works


[07-May-20 05:08 PM] JAYDEN#5487
As I already expressed, a report will come out shortly (M: probably in a month when im done school stuff), but as I have previously expressed, it isnt as simple to get into the forum as you express


[07-May-20 05:08 PM] JAYDEN#5487
School Staff aren't stupid, they know whats going on


[07-May-20 05:08 PM] JAYDEN#5487
and I would never say that they would intentionally let a troublesome teenager into a safe space


[07-May-20 05:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will be awaiting a full report


[07-May-20 05:24 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The government will be waiting for a full report before making any decisions regarding this


[07-May-20 05:37 PM] JAYDEN#5487

[07-May-20 05:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
For starters how about change Safe Schools to be about all bullying and not just one group? Let's make schools safe for everyone

I can forsee your website idea leading to bullying and exclusion in some sections


[07-May-20 05:53 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Please elaborate


[07-May-20 05:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well putting students in charge of deciding who can be in certain groups and what they can do will allow those students to then pick and choose and may not be for the best. It is why many schools removed the ability for prefects (trusted students) from giving out punishments.


[07-May-20 05:58 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Again, the students would not at all be in charge of it


[07-May-20 05:58 PM] JAYDEN#5487
They merely give advice to the staff

Hello Mr. Prime Minister, no need to be snappy!


[06-Jun-20 06:04 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I'm just asking why you decided to cut the Minister for Mental Health?


[06-Jun-20 06:05 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Whilst I understand it comes under health, as I've discussed with you before, I believe its important to have a minister directly for mental health.


[06-Jun-20 06:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Mental Health comes under the health portfolio.


[06-Jun-20 06:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
I am not aware of such discussions


[06-Jun-20 06:12 PM] JAYDEN#5487
As I just said Mr Pime Minister, I am aware it comes under health but it is important that there is a dedicated minister to deal with mental health


[06-Jun-20 06:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well the Minister would be the Health Minister anyway as it would create to much bureaucracy and prevent substantial work in dealing with Mental Health from occurring


[06-Jun-20 06:17 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Mr Prime Minister, I disagree. There are many realms of health, and Mental Health needs a dedicated Member of Parliament. My Professional advice to the cabinet is to appoint a minister for mental health

We have a person appointed in dealing with mental health, that is you, our ambassador. If you do not want the job, just say so and the cabinet will arrange for someone more committed to the role.

[06-Jun-20 06:20 PM] JAYDEN#5487
If you wanted someone who was going to agree with you on everything and not give their advice you've found the wrong person


[06-Jun-20 06:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I don’t think political positions have anything to do with mental health


[06-Jun-20 06:21 PM] inactive#6974
I remind the Prime Minister that, in any given year, 1 in 5 Aussies, 4 million people, suffer from a mental illness, and during their lifetimes, almost half the population suffer from a mental illness. I find it shameful there is not a Minister for Mental Health, because it is an issue that cannot be shoved away under health, putting too much responsibility on the Health Minister.


[06-Jun-20 06:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hence why we have an Ambassador for Mental Health


[06-Jun-20 06:23 PM] JAYDEN#5487
But Mr Prime Minister, I have no power in your cabinet room. I advise you, that is all. I do not consult on any options and I was not even consulted on the Blue Balls initiative. Mr Prime Minister I do not have any power in parliament merely a voice. We need a minister that has that power to deliver initiatives in parliament


[06-Jun-20 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
I asked for you recommendations, you made them. We as a cabinet went one step further to our mental health commitments and are doing the job. Please stop complaining about preserving Australia’s mental health as it completely contradicts your role as ambassador


[06-Jun-20 06:28 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Mr Pirme Minister, this is my point. I was never consulted on what policies were getting implemented. We need a minister that will actually have power in your cabinet room.


[06-Jun-20 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
That’s because the Minister of Health did it, voiding your argument that they don’t have time


[06-Jun-20 06:33 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Mr Prime Minister, my point is that you never consulted a Mental Health Professional for your other proposals. My job is to advise you on your policies, to date, you have not done that. My official recommentations to the government is to either utilise my expertise more or appoint a Member to be the minister.


[06-Jun-20 06:34 PM] JAYDEN#5487
However I must now leave to have another meeting, thank you for your time.
