The hard-nosed, cynical population of 1.523 billion New Worshipians are kept under strict control by the oppressive government, which measures its success by the nation's GDP and refers to individual citizens as "human resources.""

In response, the site‚Äôs owners suspended the accounts of all those who were not members of the Order. Bachelors, bachelorettes and believers from across Ilhain have interrupted you while you are at dinner with family, demanding an immediate solution to their dating woes.

[18-Apr-21 02:48 PM] Zak#6496
FPTP is the system NationStates has relied upon for 10 years


[18-Apr-21 02:48 PM] Pav#1147
Aye


[18-Apr-21 02:49 PM] Ascari#4541
FPTP is the default voting system as NationStates is the original authority for NationStates occurrences


[18-Apr-21 02:49 PM] Ascari#4541
if the system were to change it would have to be changed through FPTP

ANyway if i win i will set up a new poll to decide vice leader


[18-Apr-21 02:50 PM] Ascari#4541
furthermore it only makes sense that an entirely different thing to AusSim be outside of the jurisdiction of AusSim for the sake of conflict of interest


[18-Apr-21 02:50 PM] Zak#6496
And then give that winner certian powers as a regional officer

its just a fake thing really

the WA is basically the UN with power


[18-Apr-21 02:51 PM] doctor#0002
Lol


[18-Apr-21 02:51 PM] Zak#6496
if they pass a law ur nation "technicallY" complies


[18-Apr-21 02:51 PM] Zak#6496
but NS doesnt have a system to measure that


[18-Apr-21 02:51 PM] inactive#6974
Lol


[18-Apr-21 02:52 PM] Ascari#4541
so basically if we pass a law saying "you can not shoot people who are your political opponents" then it would be applied to my nation, but I could just quietly shoot people anyway and all the WA can do is issue a motion saying that it condemns me


[18-Apr-21 02:52 PM] Zak#6496
yes


[18-Apr-21 02:52 PM] BHjr132#2979
WA delegate election in game is technically approval voting since you can endorse however many people you want and the person with the most endorsements becomes delegate


[18-Apr-21 02:52 PM] Ascari#4541
I approve of this


[18-Apr-21 02:53 PM] Zak#6496
I do understand this


[18-Apr-21 02:53 PM] Zak#6496
In the founder regions they have set up endorsement caps and decided Delegate thru elections of other means


[18-Apr-21 02:53 PM] Zak#6496
but we need a constituion first before that can happen
