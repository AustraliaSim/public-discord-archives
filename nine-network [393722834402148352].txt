We have obained an **exclusive** statement from newly appointed (pending Parliamentary vote) Justice @Deleted User 512350472


[22-Dec-17 09:58 PM] djello#5901
"I am very happy to share with the national review my excitement of being appointed to this position. 

I have tremendous respect for our legal system and am honouredd to serve Australiasim in this way."


[22-Dec-17 09:58 PM] djello#5901
"I wish the best for the other applicants. It's not a matter of who would be best for the position, but who would be less of a loss to the sim from what they were currently doing.


[22-Dec-17 09:59 PM] djello#5901
"If you do a ?whois on Dicky_Knee you will see I hold join position #1. I think this speaks for itself. I hope to use my experience in this new role of Justice.

I thank the people of Brisbane and my NSW Senate voters who have put their faith in me every term of this sim. I am really keen to serve you in the High Court. God bless you all."

Im actually hearing from an annonymous source that only 2 people havent voted in Whitlam so we'll be hearing those results hopefully soon


[26-Jan-18 05:15 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
as it stands, it'll be a Greens gain, but not everyone in Whitlam has voted, and if there was a full turnout I wouldn't be surprised by a Soc Dem gain


[26-Jan-18 05:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, lets move on to Lyne where we see @Catiline @One Nation to Rule them All  and @Deleted User  Running


[26-Jan-18 05:17 PM] Ash#8178

I too think Maiq will keep it


[26-Jan-18 05:18 PM] djello#5901
I agree, Lyne is a safe left-wing seat and there's just no other left-leaning challengers


[26-Jan-18 05:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
But I do think @One Nation to Rule them All  Will prove a slight challenge with 2 Australia party members in the electorate but It will stick with Maiq


[26-Jan-18 05:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
The next Electorate is Greenway where we see the only candidates are long time speaker @General_Rommel  and @Ben Walke


[26-Jan-18 05:21 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
Greenway is an interesting seat insofar as there is a decent right-leaning presence in the electorate, but no right-leaning candidate. I think General_Rommel will win this seat easily.


[26-Jan-18 05:21 PM] Ash#8178
Definitely GR


[26-Jan-18 05:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
GR Will keep it I agree


[26-Jan-18 05:22 PM] djello#5901

[26-Jan-18 05:25 PM] djello#5901
Greens, Dems, AP, Liberty and an independent


[26-Jan-18 05:25 PM] djello#5901
yes I agree that @Perekai will be a favourite for the seat

[26-Jan-18 05:27 PM] djello#5901

I think preferences will allow the Democrats to retain the seat.

If the SocDems go with Liberty it could be a draw with the socialists


[26-Jan-18 05:37 PM] Ash#8178
Chisholm might be a liberty gain or a tie


[26-Jan-18 05:38 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I think Melbourne will come down to Liberty v Greens. I suspect that if there's a full turnout the seat will tie.


[26-Jan-18 05:39 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
Same in Chisholm except replace the word Greens with Socialists.


[26-Jan-18 05:39 PM] Ash#8178

[26-Jan-18 05:39 PM] djello#5901
Where it comes down to the SocDems, it's very hard to tell considering they appear to be a left-wing party, but have been rumoured to have made a deal with Liberty.


[26-Jan-18 05:40 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
"rumoured"


[26-Jan-18 05:40 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

Liberty and SocDems do have similar positions socially and some economically.


[26-Jan-18 05:42 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
Owing to the SocDems being social democratic in name only.

I think the Greens will win Gorton, and I'm puzzled why Liberty are bothering to run there at all.

Only Liberty and the Greens will get more than one first preference, and I think the preferences will go to the Greens.

I will call it for Kingethan15

I just don't think the Greens have the votes to make much impact there

[26-Jan-18 06:00 PM] abiramen#1521
Oh, it'd be close


[26-Jan-18 06:00 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
If there's a complete turnout this seat will tie 4-4.

2 socialists, 1 green and one left-leaning independent? I call that 4 votes for the Greens.


[26-Jan-18 06:02 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

In some ways, key case being gun laws, the Libs and Socs are closer to each other than center


[26-Jan-18 06:09 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

Greens leader NKG is much more centrist than the other senior greens, and if NKG wasn't re-elected the Greens may be more open to working with the socialists than NKG would allow.

Are you satisfied with the current government?


[17-Feb-18 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Many in the opposition have accused the populous of being  heavily anti Government while the Government claims to be the popular choice

[17-Feb-18 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do you support the passing of the Election simulation (Referendum) Bill 2018?


[17-Feb-18 05:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now this bill is effectively the governments only agenda so the Prime minister would hope it at least has popular support

Good evening, AustraliaSim.
Recently, with the publishing of the National Review's previous article, Socialist Leader and Prime Minister Bsharri, has come out and officially said he will be writing a response. 
He had politely declined an interview with us here on the National Review, so we are waiting eagerly to hear what he has to say in the near future.

This has been a quick update from the National Review,
Good night AustraliaSim.

Good evening Australia, this is National Review.

Your results are in, and the poll details are now ready to be shown.

You gave us a ballot paper indicating who *you* would be voting for, and from that, we’ve generated a profile for each party and what their data tells us!

[01-Jun-18 05:58 PM] Perekai#6805
We had received a total of twenty-eight responses. With that, lets move onto the analysis of each party.


[01-Jun-18 05:58 PM] Perekai#6805
**The Socialist Party**
The Socialist Party, the previous major coalition leader in our government, has come back with perhaps the most polarising results from any other party. While leading a *somewhat* strong eight votes shared between first and second preference, they had reached an astronomical *thirteen* last preference votes – out of twenty-eight responses, just under half would prefer any other party. That being said, The Socialist Party has been shown to defy predictions, so we will move on.


[01-Jun-18 05:59 PM] Perekai#6805
**The Liberal Party**
The Liberal Party, our last governments opposition, and spiritual successors of the Liberty Party, who had held government prior to our last one. The Liberal Party in this survey has brought out the largest number of first-preference votes with ten. However, they seem to lag in their second-to-sixth preference votes, which implies most people other than its main voters have lost faith in the party. Predictions have been made that the Liberal Party will lose the contested seats simply due to the lack of sympathetic second preference votes. Though with the seats they have already secured, this could hardly be considered a defeat for The Liberal Party this election cycle.


[01-Jun-18 05:59 PM] Perekai#6805
**Australian Labor Party**
The Australian Labor Party is unfortunately lagging in first and second preference votes. Holding a very strong third-to-fifth preference votes and zero seventh preference votes indicates that they are not particularly loved, nor hated by the constituency. This happy medium should allow Labor to coast rather comfortably this term, and with the securing of the seat of Canberra, Labor should happily fulfil their niche this cycle.


[01-Jun-18 05:59 PM] Perekai#6805
**The Centre Alliance**
The Centre Alliance has come forward with a robust reply. With a rather regular four first preference votes followed by an astounding eleven votes in second preference shows that the Centre Alliance is the constituents favourite cross-bench party. However, the Centre Alliance is predicted to win very few seats – due to a lack of a strong support base and low candidates – though will still remain the position as perhaps the most consistently reputable party.


[01-Jun-18 06:00 PM] Perekai#6805
**The Pirate Party**
The Pirate Party is quite the oddity. With the change of leadership – and perhaps change of ideology – has led the Pirate Party to be left off to the side. The low first-to-third preference votes indicates that most of its voters have left for other left-wing parties, and that the majority of its fourth-to-sixth preference votes are simply a result of a preferable alternative over the other contentious parties.


[01-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Perekai#6805
**The Viking Party**
The Viking Party is the newest party to enter the political sphere, though it seems to be polling quite poorly. Formed from former Socialist Party members, and following a similar ideology, has left it alienated with most non-Soc voters, and a very comfortable second preference vote for Socialist Party voters. It’s measly one first preference vote yet strong five second preference vote implies perhaps that the Viking Party’s strongest voter base are simply Socialist Party voters.


[01-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Perekai#6805
**Independents**
The Independent candidates this election cycle have polled incredibly well – in fact, in a simulated election of a seat, the Independent polling would win with the strongest majority – beating the Liberal Party. While this ignores the reality of the election, it shows that many people prefer independent candidates over most parties. The reasoning behind this could be varied, though with two failed governments succeeding each other, there is no doubt that a desire for non-partisan politics is rising.

If Brisbane goes to the :CA:, there will be **no chance** of a left coalifion led government.

If the UDP is struggling to win in Greenway (i:e, a small margin), something has gone very wrong for them.


[23-Dec-18 08:46 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The winner of the election will probably be clear by the time Sydney is declared. If the SDP does not win Whitlam, they won’t win government.


[23-Dec-18 08:47 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
However, a victory for independent CircleSongIsDank in Wright does not mean a loss for the left. CircleSongIsDank has said he prefers Youmaton as Prime Minister, and that he calls himself leftist.

Let’s review our predictions with what happened, and of course, what will happen next.


[24-Dec-18 05:47 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We did predict Batman correctly.


[24-Dec-18 05:48 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Bradfield was, however, a surprise upset, going to TheOWOTriangle of the SDP.


[24-Dec-18 05:48 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We did predict Brisbane, Canberra and Chisholm correctly.


[24-Dec-18 05:49 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Denison, however, went to the UDP, and that was a mistake- we had predicted a SDP seat.


[24-Dec-18 05:50 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Apart from that, our only other incorrect prediction was Melbourne- again, another surprise upset.


[24-Dec-18 05:50 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

To the government!


[24-Dec-18 05:54 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
It seems almost certain we’ll see a left coalition government, with perhaps the Centre Alliance in confidence and supply, with Youmaton of the Social Democrats having been sworn in as Prime Minister, with ChairmanMeeseeks, the Member for Sydney, as the deputy.


[24-Dec-18 05:56 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
There were initally some mutters of a half-senate election to ensure the government’s majority in the senate, however that now seems to be unnecessary, as the possibility of the left coalition working with the Centre Alliance increases.


[24-Dec-18 05:57 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Yesterday saw an unexpectedly large number of SDP MPs, including an upset loss for AussieConservative in Bradfield.


[24-Dec-18 07:46 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
He was replaced by TheOWOTriangle, who holds the seat on a 6-point margin.


[24-Dec-18 07:46 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
He’s here with us now.


[24-Dec-18 07:46 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Welcome!


[24-Dec-18 07:46 AM] TheTriangle#4346
Hello there


[24-Dec-18 07:47 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
So, were you expecting to be elected on Sunday?


[24-Dec-18 07:48 AM] TheTriangle#4346
No, not at all. I was preparing a speech for my defeat but you should never do anything too early I guess.


[24-Dec-18 07:50 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Wow! So, you stood for Greenway back in April- this is only your second election contested and first one you’ve actually won- could you tell us about your policies and what you hope to achieve for your electorate?


[24-Dec-18 07:52 AM] TheTriangle#4346
I hope to represent my parties values towards my electorate as well as push for local issues. I'm hoping that I can retain my seat next election and be able to stop a flip from any blue wave.


[24-Dec-18 07:53 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Could you tell us more about your idelogy and beliefs?


[24-Dec-18 07:54 AM] TheTriangle#4346
I stand for the social democratic principles of the party. Such as higher taxes on big business and a more progressive stance on LGBT rights.


[24-Dec-18 07:55 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, can you tell us anything about the government? Who’ll be involved? Who’ll be in cabinet?


[24-Dec-18 07:57 AM] TheTriangle#4346
We've only just had the election, nothing seems final apart from a Radical-Labour-SDP deal with CA in C&S making Youma PM.


[24-Dec-18 07:57 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What do you think of the possibility of a republic?


[24-Dec-18 08:00 AM] TheTriangle#4346
This is where I may slightly differ from my peers. I personally think that the monarchy isn't harming us but instead increasing our relations with the commonwealth and therefore increasing our diplomatic reach.

[24-Dec-18 08:02 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And why?


[24-Dec-18 08:04 AM] TheTriangle#4346
I would pick the Ministry of Arts, Culture and Sport. I believe I have more knowledge in Arts, Culture and Sport then others, it also interests me a lot.


[24-Dec-18 08:10 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
@TheTriangle What do you think of your predecessor, AussieConservative?


[24-Dec-18 08:12 AM] TheTriangle#4346
To be honest I've don't know much about him however the amount of times he asked for a recount he seems like another Liberal too egotistic for politics since he couldn't bear losing his seat.


[24-Dec-18 08:13 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What do you think you’d like to do in government?


[24-Dec-18 08:14 AM] TheTriangle#4346
I'd not want to take a heavy role just yet since I don't have the experience however if I could actively debate and help out I'd be happy.


[24-Dec-18 08:15 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Any bills you’d like to pass?


[24-Dec-18 08:15 AM] TheTriangle#4346
Nothing comes to mind straight away however there would probably be a few


[24-Dec-18 08:16 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Despite being projected to have as many as 7 seats, they only held their numbers, having barely enough MPs to fill a Toyota Corolla.


[24-Dec-18 09:37 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
This also meant that one incumbent Liberal MP lost his seat. The former MP for Chisholm attempted and failed to win Bradfield, losing to Social Democrat TheOWOTriangle.

No I wasn’t. I put up a strong campaign throughout the election, unlike TheOWOTriangle and I just don’t see how I managed to lose it.

I reckon there was some dodgy counting methods in place.

I have conceded the election, but I’d like to see a change to the voting process in future, to prevent cases like this from happening again.

Former MP maiqtheliar42 has been confirmed as a Justice of the High Court in a close call for the government, with the Centre Alliance refusing to vote aye on the confirmation.


[10-Jan-19 07:11 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The vote was-
12 :aye: 
11 :NO: 
1 :Abstain: 
2 🍃 (on leave)


[10-Jan-19 07:12 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The sole abstention was the Member for Lingiari, silicon_based_life, in the joint parliamentary sitting of the House and the Senate.


[10-Jan-19 07:13 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Every MP and Senator, excluding the MPs on leave, all showed up to vote on this.


[10-Jan-19 07:14 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Indeed, it seemed as if the government might lose this vote, with only 12 out of 24 votes at the very most.


[10-Jan-19 07:14 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
But with the Member for Lingiari’s abstention and expert whipping from both sides, maiqtheliar42 is now sitting on the Supreme Court.

The Government argued that maiqtheliar42’s political experience made them a fitting pick for the High Court (not the Supreme Court, excuse my mistake), while the Opposition decried the pick as opportunistic.


[10-Jan-19 07:19 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
If the government had lost this crucial vote, no doubt the opposition would view this as weakness.


[10-Jan-19 07:20 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
But the government may now seem emboldened.


[10-Jan-19 07:21 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Under misinformation that was got from somewhere, someone said he was a law student. This was later adjusted to "his girlfriend is a law student".

At the time, I didn't really know who this person was. They were a mystery.


[10-Jan-19 07:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thinking further about it, I decided to vote no for the following reasons:


[10-Jan-19 07:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
This would mean the bench is biased with two socialists on because of Bellman being the sole person outside of that bubble.


[10-Jan-19 07:34 AM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Jan-19 07:38 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
When you say that Maiqtheliar42 was a socialist, do you think that the government in this case was trying to sway the court towards them?

I'm not prepared to make a definite call on that but I felt as if the chance of that was too high.

Welcome to FourFourtyNine's rolling vote of the vote on tbyrn21 to be voted onto the High Court with a vote in parliament.


[11-Jan-19 06:42 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
There are currently 26 MPs and Senators, minus 2 on leave.


[11-Jan-19 06:42 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The number most likely needed to confirm tbyrn21 will be 13.


[11-Jan-19 06:44 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Currently, the vote is 7 ayes, and 1 no.


[11-Jan-19 06:44 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
tbyrn21's confirmation looks to have recieved bipartisan support, with Liberal MPs and Senators voting in favour of the confirmation.


[11-Jan-19 06:44 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The only vote against tbyrn21 is from the Member for Batman- the Liberal Party leader, n4ziporridge.


[11-Jan-19 06:44 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Currently about a third of MPs have shown up.


[11-Jan-19 06:45 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
MPs and Senators, however, have not yet been notified of the vote via the proper system, and so the vote will likely be extended, as the Prime Minister pointed out earlier.

[12-Jan-19 08:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
There was talk from people involved about this group about how appointing maiq, and experienced former minister with great knowledge of the law, undermined faith in the court. Folks. If that's undermining faith in the court, what is planning to dissolve it?


[12-Jan-19 08:10 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Do you plan to appoint a replacement?


[12-Jan-19 08:12 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well, it would unbalance the court, but also take us back to three members. So there's merits to appointing a replacement, and merits to not. But this has taught us that vetting will have to be done very, very carefully. Even more so than currently


[12-Jan-19 08:13 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

We have recieved advice from a legal excrement that the referrals are likely ‘invalid’, and with umatbru, DirtySaiyan, Youmaton and TheOWOTriangle debating in the parliamentary sessions after the bill, they would appear to be protected if any referral came up, with onlyTheWhiteFerret, Dicky_Knee and Bsharri still at risk.

First up, in world news, a second woman has accused Virginia's Lieutenant Governor of assault.


[09-Feb-19 04:36 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Meredith Watson alleges that Lieutenant Governor Wilson raped her while they were both students at a university in North Carolina.


[09-Feb-19 04:37 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
This comes after calls for his superior, Ralph Northam, to resign over revelations he had done blackface, in high school.


[09-Feb-19 04:38 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Mr Wilson rejects the allegations, saying that "It is obvious that a vicious and co-ordinated smear campaign is being orchestrated against me", and refused to resign.

Following the referral of seven MPs to the High Court by the Speaker of the House, the Parliamentary Participation (Overhaul) Act 2019 has been brought to the Senate by leader of the Centre Alliance, lieselta.


[09-Feb-19 04:41 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
It aims to loosen requirements on parliamentary debating. Lieselta stated in her second reading speech on the bill that 'a Member of Parliament will be required to be referred if they do not attend at least 8 consecutive votes or debates, or fail to vote on at least 33.3% of a consecutive grouping consisting of 12 pieces of business. This also applies to debates but at 25% required attendance.'


[09-Feb-19 04:41 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
With the High Court likely to accept the referrals soon based on statements from PM-ME-SPRINKLES, we will be watching this situation closely.

In Finland, the results of a trial for a universal basic income, in which participants were given a lump sum of money with no conditions, revealed an increase in happiness among the participants, but no discernible increase in employment.


[09-Feb-19 04:43 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Fifty-five percent of basic income participants and 46 percent of the control group surveyed at the end of last year perceived their health as good or very good. Meanwhile 17 percent of basic income recipients and 25 percent of the control group said they experienced quite a high degree or very high degree of stress over the past two years. The response rate for the survey was 23 percent.


[09-Feb-19 04:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The experimented ended late last year, which had been launched by the government of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, which is up for re-election again this year on April 14. Polls in the country show his government stagnating in polls with Sipilä's Centre Party on 15.6% in polls, compared to the leading Social Democratic Party of Finland, on 20.2%.

6 arrests have been made in the case of a murder of an anti-corruption Ghanaian journalist who exposed a high-ranking FIFA official as corrupt. Ahmed Hussein-Suale was shot dead by 2 gunmen in Accra on January 16, which rocked Ghana, which is widely considered one of the most advanced democracies in Africa, rated a 6.63 on the democracy scale, above Serbia, Hungary and Mexico, being ranked in the group of 'flawed democracies', to which prosperous countries like the USA, France and South Africa sit in.


[09-Feb-19 04:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Hussein-Suale worked for Tiger Eye PI media, and worked on a sting exposing now-banned FIFA official Kwesi Nyantakyi accepting $65,000 from reporters posing as unethical businessmen and promising to use his position as the head of Ghanaian soccer to secure favorable deals for them.

Concern has, however, been raised over this, especially with President Trump's penchant of praising dictators. The country's human rights record is oft-criticised, with civil liberties non-existent, freedom of movement practically abolished, and giant death camps across the country. Freedom House states that "North Korea is a one-party state led by a dynastic totalitarian dictatorship. Surveillance is pervasive, arbitrary arrests and detention are common, and punishments for political offenses are severe."

Welcome back to Getaway! We're here on the Addu Atoll on the island of Vili...Vili...Vore...We're here on the Addu Atoll at the Shangri-La Maldives!


[09-Feb-19 07:18 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
But before we check in to our Deluxe Pool Villa with views of the sea overlooking lush gardens, my guide, who's name I don't know, is going to take me to the tallest point in the Maldives! Be prepared for something large!


[09-Feb-19 07:19 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
*The guide walks Natalie a few meters to a small hill about as tall as her, and stands on top of it, telling her this is the tallest point in the Maldives.*


[09-Feb-19 07:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What..what the fuck?


[09-Feb-19 07:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Is this really the tallest point?


[09-Feb-19 07:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I've dated guys with dicks larger than this!


[09-Feb-19 07:20 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

[09-Feb-19 07:21 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
*The Getaway theme song plays again, transitioning to show Natalie at her Deluxe Pool Villa.*


[09-Feb-19 07:23 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Wow, look at how beautiful this is!


[09-Feb-19 07:23 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Nestled in rich vegetation, Deluxe Pool Villa guests can enjoy stunning views of the turquoise ocean from their own infinity pool and a separate living room providing extra space and comfort.


[09-Feb-19 07:23 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The bedroom and bathroom look out to the sea, while the patio features outdoor furniture designed for dining under the stars on a balmy evening.


[09-Feb-19 07:23 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And I get to enjoy this, all thanks to HelloWorld!


[09-Feb-19 07:25 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Before we wrap up tonight, I have one last thing to show you.


[09-Feb-19 07:26 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
As the sun sets, you're hard pressed to find a bad place to sit back with a drink in this beautiful country.


[09-Feb-19 07:27 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Unless you're a Muslim.


[09-Feb-19 07:27 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
In which case, do not drink.


[09-Feb-19 07:27 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Like, it's banned.


[09-Feb-19 07:29 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
But, if you're not a Muslim, then I know the perfect place in this beautiful resort to sit down with an alcoholic drink.


[09-Feb-19 07:30 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The beautiful Manzuru..sorry, Manzaru lounge offers a sophisticated tropical escape with an elegant setting and smooth music to watch the sun go down as I have a drink and get heroin injected in my arm.


[09-Feb-19 07:30 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Sorry, just the first one.


[09-Feb-19 07:30 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
I do not do heroin, as far as you know.


[09-Feb-19 07:32 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Before we go tonight, I'd like to give a big thank you to HelloWorld for funding my vacation here. If you want a beautiful vacation with small mountains, lovely food, and a great sunset, speak to your local HelloWorld agent. This is Natalie Bronze, from Shangri-La Maldives, signing off.

Welcome to Nine Morning News. I'm Natalie Bronze.
First in today's news, Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, who has previously been involved in scandals over her so-called Native American ancestry, which most recently erupted when she took a DNA test proving she had around 1% of Native American ancestry, which numerous tribes described as 'disrespectful', is now formally running for President.


[10-Feb-19 07:01 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The Senator, who had previously formed an explanatory committee, announced last night that she would be seeking the Democratic nomination in 2020. She refuses to take money from political action committees and lobbyists.

In the United Kingdom, a Conservative MP under fire for blocking a bill banning upskirting has recieved further criticism for again blocking a bill to give courts power to issue protection order for women at risk of genital mutilation.


[10-Feb-19 07:02 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Fellow MPs within the party have criticised him, including Zac Goldsmith and Sajid David. The MP in question who blocked the bill, Sir Christopher Chope, is well-known to reject private members' bills to make sure all legislation is properly debated.


[10-Feb-19 07:03 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
A survivor of female genital mutilation, or FGM, reportedly 'begged' Sir Chope not to block the bill, which culminated in her calling him "an embarrassment to your party and humanity".

Meanwhile, a miracle in Mexico yesterday as Eva Ramon Gallegos managed to eradicate the human papilloma virus in 29 patients, accomplished via photodynamic therapy, a non-invasive technique that has been used to now prevent the second-leading cause of death among Mexican women.


[10-Feb-19 07:07 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
An Adelaide brickie spoke to ABC this morning about his experience in taking down the Berlin Wall. When he was just 19, John Curtin helped take down the wall. His wife from West Germany, Heike, described 'pure hate' for the wall, stating that after the wall was built by the murderous communist regime that 'A lot of people tried to get out after the wall was built, and a lot of people died. In the area I lived there was a special grave for people that died … it was disgusting.'


[10-Feb-19 07:08 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Curtin's father was a soldier stationed in Berlin, and Curtin describes the day that Germany reunifies- 'You'd be walking down the road and you'd see a Trabant, beeping its horn, the people waving and you'd wave back. They were so happy, the East German people. Everyone was delighted that Germany was going to be a whole country again. The euphoria was amazing.'

To local news, last Friday in New South Wales, a judge handed down a landmark ruling, rejecting plans for a coal mine on the grounds it would worsen climate change. Judge Brian Paterson ruled that the proposed Gloucester Coal Mine would be in 'the wrong place at the wrong time'.


[10-Feb-19 07:14 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Gloucester Resources has previously stated this coal mine would create hundreds of jobs and be in place for a mere 2 decades.


[10-Feb-19 07:16 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Meanwhile in Paris, thousands of French yellow vest protestors marched last night, with a demonstrator's hand being injured by an explosive. The 'yellow vest' demonstrators, named for high-visibility car jackets, began in mid-November over fuel taxes then broadened into a more general revolt against a political class they view as out of touch with common people.

We're here live at Parliament House during Question Time, we can see MPs coming in behind me.


[10-Feb-19 04:31 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Australia Tonight reported yesterday that the BloodyChrome government's budget is invalid, based on their failure to successfully fulfil the parameters laid out in Section 56 of the Constitution.


[10-Feb-19 04:32 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
We have recieved word that AnswerMeNow1, MP for Gorton, has made a submission to the High Court of Australia in regards to this.


[10-Feb-19 04:34 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Meanwhile, in New Zealand, a fire has broken up in the north of the South Island, with thousands of residents in the district of Tasman and the city of Nelson evacuating.


[10-Feb-19 04:35 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
New Zealand media has been describing it as the worst fire the area has seen in a half-century.


[10-Feb-19 04:36 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Both local MP Nick Smith and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have stated messages of sympathy to the region.

Reuters reports that the United States is in direct talks with the Venezuelan military, encouraging them to defect from the regime of dictator Nicolas Maduro.


[10-Feb-19 04:37 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
In addition, according to a senior official in the White House, President Trump is planning increased sanctions on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.


[10-Feb-19 04:38 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
However, only a few officers have done so since the United States and other nations recognised Juan Guaido as the legitimate President of Venezuela.


[10-Feb-19 04:40 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Meanwhile, as ice melts rapidly in Russia, nasty effects are ensuing for some parts of the largest nation on Earth, with polar bears attacking local residents on the Novaya Zemlya islands. The deputy head of the region reports that "People are scared, afraid to leave their homes, their daily routines are being broken, and parents are unwilling to let their children go to school or kindergarten".


[10-Feb-19 04:40 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
In 2016, scientists in the islands were besieged by polar bears for weeks on end at a remote weather station.


[10-Feb-19 04:43 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
In the United States, President Trump's deadline in the Senate to report on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi Arabia has expired, with the White House refusing to report on if it believed Mohammad bin-Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia, ordered the killing.


[10-Feb-19 04:45 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, was known for criticising the Saudi government, and was murdered and dismembered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.


[10-Feb-19 04:46 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
A report from the CIA had found that Mohammad bin-Salman had ordered the murder, which he denies. Republican and Democrat senators triggered the Global Magnitsky Act on October 10, 2018, which required the president to investigate and determine if a foreign person is responsible for Khashoggi's death within 120 days. The White House had until Saturday to submit their report.


[10-Feb-19 04:48 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Mohammed bin-Salman reportedly also threatened to kill Mr. Khashoggi before his murder in the Istanbul consulate.


[10-Feb-19 04:48 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The CIA had also reported that  the Saudi leader said he would use "a bullet" against the Washington Post columnist if he did not stop publishing unflattering reports about the regime, The New York Times reported.


[10-Feb-19 04:50 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, inside Question Time, Senator BloodyChrome has derided the "rubbish, grubby reporting" of Australia Tonight in response to their reports that the budget his government submitted was invalid.


[10-Feb-19 04:50 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The Senator was warned not to rant in a sedentary position, then stood and asked if he could rant while standing up.


[10-Feb-19 04:53 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Aside from this, however, Question Time has been rather lackluster, with the main questions coming from the Member for Pearce. The only opposition members in attendance are himself, Senator TheAudibleAsh, and the Member for Gorton, who is on the crossbench.


[10-Feb-19 04:55 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Anyway, first on the agenda today.


[05-Mar-19 07:00 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
One. Dicky Goes Hissy.


[05-Mar-19 07:00 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
So, earlier today, we got some explosive news.


[05-Mar-19 07:00 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Richard Knee of the Liberals is apparently trying to spill Porridge. Crazy, right?


[05-Mar-19 07:01 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Apparently, the Liberals voted to merge with the United Australia Party.


[05-Mar-19 07:01 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The Liberals are scheduled to rename to either Liberty or Liberal Democrats.


[05-Mar-19 07:01 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Ooh, Liberty.


[05-Mar-19 07:01 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And, I mean, come on.


[05-Mar-19 07:01 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
This is the worst possible time.


[05-Mar-19 07:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
If you were going to have a shitstorm, don't have it while the other side's lost their majority. I mean, come on. That's like Politics 101. Apart from, y'know, pay off your mistresses.


[05-Mar-19 07:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
So, next.


[05-Mar-19 07:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Two. Flip Flop Flips And Flops.


[05-Mar-19 07:03 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Today, AnswerMeNow1, after dissolving the Regional Victoria Alliance, joined the Socialist Party.


[05-Mar-19 07:05 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
This gives the government- plus the Centre Alliance of course- with a majority.

A Social Democrat and a UAP candidate.

sdp uap 

[05-Mar-19 07:12 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
So if the Social Democrat wins, we have the Social Democrats and the Socialists with a majority in the lower house- again.


[05-Mar-19 07:12 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
But if the UAP wins- well, buckle up. Just like you need to do later, Natalie. *Natalie Bronze winks at Natalie Wynn, who giggles. Natalie Bronze walks off.*

Manly_Kitten has won the seat of Brisbane, leaving the Left Coalition without a majority and the UAP with 2 seats.


[06-Mar-19 12:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
With AnswerMeNow1 being referred to the High Court, the government is threatened, and may call a snap election.


[06-Mar-19 12:22 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The latest an election may be called is 22 March 2019.

Ugh, this tastes bitter and sour, like it’s gone off past its due date.


[07-Mar-19 06:05 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Just like the Youmaton government.


[07-Mar-19 06:05 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Ooh, snake wine! I love me some snake wine.


[07-Mar-19 06:06 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Unfortunately, it doesn’t go too well with the Youmaton government, like Horror-HQ, who defected to the Australian Conservatives- then the Liberals? I don’t know.


[07-Mar-19 06:07 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
But what does this all have to do with news?


[07-Mar-19 06:07 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
*Natalie Bronze walks onto the stage.*


[07-Mar-19 06:10 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Anyway, last night, *begins Natalie Bronze*, the Youmaton government lost their majority because MP for Wright defected, stating that they hated communists.


[07-Mar-19 06:11 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
This left the Youmaton government with no majority.


[07-Mar-19 06:12 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And then even less of a majority when the Centre Alliance left the government, although they remain apprehensive on how they may vote on a vote of no confidence brought towards the house.

First up tonight, a court case from AnswerMeNow1 against the Commonwealth of Australia has commenced, arguing that the budget of the BloodyChrome government is invalid.

[09-Mar-19 04:36 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
As we can see, the poll shows the Social Democratic and Socialist Party on track to have a majority. The Centre Alliance would be out of Parliament on these polls, and the Australian Conservatives are the largest right-wing party.


[09-Mar-19 04:37 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
A stark contrast from a recent Sky News poll, showing the Centre Alliance as the *largest parliamentary party.*

President Donald Trump will host Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at the White House on March 19, to discuss a range of topics surrounding defence cooperation, trade policies, transnational crime, and of course, Venezuela, where both countries currently back Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan Speaker of the House, who claims the Presidency.


[09-Mar-19 04:39 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
A motion in Australia to recognise Mr. Guaido failed, as the Australian government called for new elections to be called, continuing to recognise Nicolas Maduro.

In the United States, actor and star of Empire, Jussie Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts after making false claims to a police officer and a detective over racially charged and homophobic slurs.

Smollett has been accused of faking an attack over anger surrounding his wage on the show, and is now facing jail time.

Activists in Tasmania during the state's duck-hunting period have claimed that they are being intimidated by the placing of a dead wallaby and amounts of human urine were placed near their campsite.


[09-Mar-19 04:50 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
The activists in question were anti-duck hunting activists, warding ducks away and speaking with shooters. They claim that their actions are "completely legal", and that they're abiding by directives and rules. Duck hunting season opened today, and will conclude on 10 June.


[09-Mar-19 04:52 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
President Donald Trump's former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, has been sentenced to almost 4 years in jail on counts of cheating banks and the government out of millions of dollars. Manafort will serve 47 months in prison, and has been ordered to pay in excess of $24 million in restitution.


[09-Mar-19 04:54 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
A Virginian jury convicted the 69-year old of 8 charges, which include bank fraud and tax fraud, however, none have to do with collusion with the Russian government.

Explosive abuse allegations have surfaced against deceased pop star Michael Jackson, with a movie at Sundance telling the story of two men who claim they were molested by Jackson as children. They reportedly came forward after Jackson's death, but their cases were dismissed for "technical reasons".

A SpaceX capsule today splashed into the coast in the Atlantic Ocean, after a SpaceX rocket launched the capsule from the Kennedy Space Centre last weekend.


[09-Mar-19 04:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Just before the capsule splashed down, the capsule deployed its two parachutes for a smooth landing. SpaceX's first manned flight is scheduled to launch in July, with two astronauts.

The Korean Meteorological Association believes that the tremor was the result of an explosion, near the mining town of Pyonggang- not to be confused with the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang.

So there are 4 seats uncontested, which leave Parliament from the start looking like this- 
:socialist: 2
:sdp: 1
:conservatives: 1


[14-Mar-19 05:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Our first seat.


[14-Mar-19 05:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Canberra**

Candidates-
:sdp: TheOWOTriangle
:socialist: Stalin1953


[14-Mar-19 05:59 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Now, this race is a little odd, since it seems like a majority right-wing seat, but there’s no right-winger candidate here.


[14-Mar-19 06:00 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
But we’re calling it for the :sdp:.


[14-Mar-19 06:01 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463

Candidates-
:sdp: hk-laichar
:uap: Manly_Kitten
:conservatives: MalooFury


[14-Mar-19 06:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
This race has a substantial UDP and UAP block, with the rest being assorted people. A :uap: seat.


[14-Mar-19 06:18 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
**Cunningham**

Candidates-
:sdp: Youmaton
:uap: BellmanTGM
:conservatives: AussieConservative

Three party leaders face off in this high-contention seat.

[22-Mar-19 06:59 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
And secondly, and perhaps in larger news, there's been more information surfacing about the proposed merger between the Liberals and the United Australia Party.


[22-Mar-19 07:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Suggesting that the merger is being finalised, TheGreatSenator, the sole UAP Senator, has defected from the party to sit as an independent, claiming that he couldn't stomach the libertarian UAP merging with what he called the neo-nazi and fascist affiliated Liberals.


[22-Mar-19 07:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
He states that he will always be a UAP member at heart.


[22-Mar-19 07:02 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
However, it's not just in the UAP that this is controversial.


[22-Mar-19 07:04 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Dicky_Knee, deputy of the Liberals, according to Australia Tonight reports, is planning a leadership spill, but will not do so until he can verify the party elections' security, claiming previous elections have been rigged.

[24-Mar-19 07:13 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Anyway, firstly, although you didn't win Capricornia, 30% of the vote is still great for an independent and largely unknown candidate. How'd you do it?


[24-Mar-19 07:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well I think I launched a strong campaign even if it came out a little off-the-cuff. My campaign did quite a lot of voter outreach and put together a compelling, concise document of my goals. Unfortunately though, it just didn't catch on..


[24-Mar-19 07:16 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, now after the election you joined the Centre Alliance, after being in the SDP. Why did you do this?


[24-Mar-19 07:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
After the election I was a bit lost in the wilderness. I had abandoned the SDP and had nowhere to go. It seemed like they were going to sell out to the centre-right, which is exactly what they ended up doing. So, I joined a party which seemed open, democratic, and willing to take up many of my causes.


[24-Mar-19 07:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
The Centre Alliance didn't contest elections but I really do think it has a good future ahead.


[24-Mar-19 07:19 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Back onto the SDP, what do you think of their alliance with the UDP? Their last place position in the Senate compared to their vote nationwide suggests some deal was done previously, as well.


[24-Mar-19 07:20 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
M: @RunasSudo I'd also really like the full Senate results


[24-Mar-19 07:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think the deal with the UDP was really the only option available for our country unless another election was to immediately follow this last one. The SDP just didn't play its cards right and the left coalition flopped in the Senate.


[24-Mar-19 07:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
This said, it does not mean the choices these two parties make should be without scrutiny. Even if there is one functional option, it cannot go on without watch.


[24-Mar-19 07:23 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What do you think of your party's decision to ally with the Socialists?


[24-Mar-19 07:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well, let me be clear. This isn't exactly a party initiative. Giving credit to the old guard in the Centre Alliance is too generous.

Senator imnofox pushed for this alliance and I am 100% behind him on this. Like I said earlier, it's necessary to scrutinise the government's activities. In the Official Opposition, we can present a better agenda for Australia as well as a look at what attentive, awake governance would be like.


[24-Mar-19 07:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think some sceptics are not sold on this partnership, but the Socialists and the Centre Alliance have a common cause on human rights in particular, which is a lot more than can be said for the SDP's choice for a coalition partner.


[24-Mar-19 07:28 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
What do you think of the Minister for Finance's decision to defect to the Socialists over transphobia?


[24-Mar-19 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
I support the Minister for Finance; the reasons are just. He'll be of greater service to the country bringing down this dull administration than being a cog in it.


[24-Mar-19 07:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
The allegations that the UDP is taking advantage of the situation are to be expected, I am unsurprised by this conduct.


[24-Mar-19 07:31 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Finally, do you have any thoughts on the merger of the Liberals and the UAP?


[24-Mar-19 07:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don't know that it will last. At start it will probably alienate some of the more conservative ex-Liberals and in the long run I reckon the old UAP members will splinter off eventually. There might be a facade of unity but who knows where it will end up in a few months.


[24-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Perhaps it will improve the politics of the country but it's yet to be seen. They've not even been registered of course.


[24-Mar-19 07:35 AM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
Alright, any final words, FinePorpoise?


[24-Mar-19 07:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, I will say that the Centre Alliance is still present and that it is still a vital force for progress in Australia. Senator imnofox will provide a model of what centrism ought to be, and hopefully we can prove ourselves in upcoming contests.

I mean, ground-penetrating radar technology is being used to discover unmarked graves.


[11-May-19 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
A team from the Flinders University was invited by the traditional owners of the land at the Lake Condah Mission cemetery (which is still in use) to investigate and scan the area.


[11-May-19 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
Back in 2012, the scanning was performed, but only now has the results for the scans been peer-reviewed and published.


[11-May-19 03:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
The results showed that 14 likely unmarked graves as well as 49 other areas may contain one or more unmarked burial.


[11-May-19 03:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
However, since the Condah project wrapped up, the team from Vic has been bombarded with requests from other regional communities.


[11-May-19 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Dr Ian Moffat from the university told ABC News that "This issue of unmarked graves particularly in cemeteries in regional areas is a huge problem...I would go out on a limb and say that nearly every rural community in Australia has got some sort of issue involving unmarked grave."

A *very* disappointing night for Labor, who came in fourth in a seat they formerly held- and with a relatively high profile candidate too. Perhaps the rename effected them, or simply a lack of campaigning?

However, there is cause for celebration for the government- MP for Nicholls AnswerMeNow1 was cleared of inactivity, and two LDP MPs have been referred to the High Court.

Australia heads to the polls today as voters are set to vote in a referendum on a republic just under 20 years before the previous one failed.


[01-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Polls have shown the Yes vote, which is supported by much of the government and some opposition members, holding a lead nationwide and in many state polls.


[01-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
However, the type of vote being held requires a double majority, meaning a majority not only on the national level but in every state and territory.


[01-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
All states have been polled, but no territories have as of yet, mainly due to minimal campaigning there.


[01-Jun-19 11:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
While there has not yet been any poll which shows the No campaign leading anywhere, all it would ultimately take is one state.

Let me rephrase.


[01-Jun-19 11:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
The double majoirty actually means the Yes campaign would need a majority of states, not all states as previously said. Territories also don't matter in terms of the double majority.


[01-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Polling has shown that the No campaign will have a difficult time, needing to win at least 3 states or a nationwide majority, both of which seem unlikely at this stage.


[01-Jun-19 11:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
The closest state according to polling is South Australia, where the Yes campaign only won 52.3% of the vote in the most recent poll.


[01-Jun-19 11:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
However, since that poll, Yes campaigners have travelled to the state to spruik a Yes vote, with Prime Minister Drunk_King_Robert putting up posters in the state, and MattMonti and Horror-HQ campaigning in the state.


[01-Jun-19 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
Outside of South Australia, Queensland is also somewhat of a state that may prove crucial for the No campaign.


[01-Jun-19 11:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
Polling shows an average of around 54.7% for the Yes campaign.


[01-Jun-19 11:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
But overall, the figures here will make it very difficult for the no campaign to pull off a majority.

Robert Menzies famously called getting a referendum to pass in Australia 'one of the labours of Hercules'.

Take his campaigning with Zhukov, a former opponent, in the republic referendum. Even if he did harbour anti-Socialist beliefs at some point I think he's proven himself more than willing to at least work well with Socialists on a variety of issues today. And that's what matters to us."

Well, I'd say that I'm not surprised by these responses. You can see that they're not on the same page with this issue. Whilst FinePorpoise acknowledged that Jayden was Deputy Leader of this alliance and tried to say he no longer held anti-socialist views, Imnofox went straight on the attack with their response. They tried to call out the "culture" within the Labor Party. They also tried to say Jayden bore no responsibility for his actions. So I'm disappointed, but not surprised.

So I decided I'd do my part to bring about the result he wanted. So I was very happy with the result and now I'm focused on my husband. He's now in a stable condition but we're not sure when he'll regain consciousness.


[02-Jun-19 03:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do you think you see yourself going into politics?


[02-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Not unless Matt needs me. If something were to happen and Matt needed some help on the trail or he was unable to continue in politics, I'd obviously do what I could for him. I'm not ruling it out, but it's not something I'm pursuing.

Liberal Senator TheMontyJohnson and Socialist MP Zhukov236 were referred to the High Court last night and this morning.


[03-Jun-19 11:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
TheMontyJohnson was elected at the May 2019 election as a Senator to serve two terms.


[03-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Zhukov236 was also elected at the May 2019 election amidst a close competition against then-Social Democratic candidate JaydenDaGamer15, who has been embroiled in controversies of their own, and has now reportedly been kidnapped.


[03-Jun-19 11:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Both are likely to be expelled.


[03-Jun-19 11:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
If TheMontyJohnson is expelled, a casual vacancy will be created, which would be filled by a Liberal candidate.


[03-Jun-19 11:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Perhaps Viado_Celtru, number 2 on the Liberal Democratic senate ticket.


[03-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
But if Zhukov236 is expelled- which seems likely- a Robertson by-election would be triggered, which may put the government's majority at risk.


[03-Jun-19 11:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
The government only has 8 out of 15 seats currently.


[03-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
If they manage to win either Sydney or Moncrieff- by no means an easy task but achievable- Robertson wouldn't be important to the government's majority.


[03-Jun-19 11:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Any Robertson by-election would occur after Sydney and Moncrieff, as by the time the court case was over, campaigning for the by-elections would be either close or in progress.

Finance Minister and MP for Capricornia FinePorpoise, in a move requiring unprecedented small Nine News ticker text, has issued two orders to nationalise the big four banks- NAB, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Westpac, which will be bought out by the RBA today.

Campaigning for the Moncrieff and Sydney by-elections began today.


[08-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
The ABC reports that 3 candidates for each seat have declared, including previously expelled MP PineappleCrusher_ in his seat of Moncrieff and former MP Horror-HQ in Sydney running as a Socialist in Sydney.


[08-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Sydney, Horror-HQ has already attracted controversy by branding his campaigners 'red shirts', which Whig candidate for Sydney and party leader Plupsnup claimed "allures to the term brown shirts during the Nazi Era. Sounds very fash to me", fash of course being shorthand for fascist.


[08-Jun-19 02:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Horror-HQ hit back, claiming the move was a Star Trek reference, saying that "In Star Trek, red shirts often play a vital, but forgotten role. I want to bring the role of my supporters to the front of the stage. Politics is a team, no one person can rule alone, nor even be elected. It’s time to recognize the value and commitment of volunteers!"


[08-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Matt Monti, who was thankfully discharged from hospital last night, also attacked the claims, saying that "I might not support this government, but I don't support calling people Nazi's for cheap political points."

In Sydney, the Liberal candidate for Sydney, JohnVolser, is the ex-SDP MP for the northern Sydney seat of Shortland.


[08-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
JohnVolser unsuccessfully challenged Liberal MP Manly-Kitten in Cowper last election, but failed.


[08-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
JohnVolser recently, however, left the party, and spends time on Twitter attacking the government, which they branded as the "failed socialist experiment".


[08-Jun-19 02:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
JohnVolser has called for stopping the republic, and has claimed that "The Socialists want to nationalise channels, 7, 9, 10, Prime7, NBN, Southern Cross, Sky and Foxtel! Then they want to privitise the ABC and SBS to just then renationalise them!", to which Socialist Minister AnswerMeNow1 asked "Who's asshole did you pull that from?" in response to the last statement.


[08-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
gavingrotegut, Socialist candidate for Moncrieff, has an odd social media history, branding Greens co-leader FinePorpoise "a child murderer" and saying he "[deprived] children of their sweet hummus", this of course being back in the days of his independent candidacy for Capricornia, where FinePorpoise ran an anti-MMP campaign.

Any elimination of Whig preferences would likely flow to the Liberals, although it should be noted a rather significant amount of preferences would be required. In Moncrieff, the Liberals would need around 70% of Whig preferences.


[14-Jun-19 07:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Sydney, they would need around 85%.

It should be noted that if the government also only picks up one of these seats and then loses Mayo before the Robertson by-election, they will lose their majority.

And so, let's review the races in Sydney in Moncrieff.


[15-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sorry, Sydney and Moncrieff.


[15-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Sydney, the race is largely between 3 candidates, with Green candidate bagolyalakuak only speaking in a last minute speech on the last day of campaigning and woof223, independent, dropping out.


[15-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Socialists are standing ex-Social Democratic MP for Wright, Horror-HQ, who has attracted controversy by labeling his supporters as 'red shits'.


[15-Jun-19 02:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberals, on the other hand, are also standing an ex-Social Democratic MP, JohnVolser, who has been branding himself in the campaign as a modern Liberal.


[15-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Whig party, however, are one of the real interesting pieces of this race. Although the Whigs did stand in Sydney at the previous election, garnering only 4.9% of the vote amidst a lackluster campaign, this time, they're running a stronger campaign, standing leader Plupsnup.


[15-Jun-19 02:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Recent polls show a tight race between JohnVolser and Plupsnup, with the Socialists on 41.3%, the Liberals on 27.9%, the Whigs on 27.6% and the since-dropped out independent on 3.3%.


[15-Jun-19 02:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
And just a slight correction- Socialist for Sydney Horror-HQ did not call his supporters 'red shits', but rather 'red shirts'.

[15-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Whigs and the Liberals are both preferencing each other, however the Liberals would need around 85% of the Whig preferences to win against the Socialists, which seems a tad unlikely, but definitely not impossible, especially if both parties have gained since the polls.


[15-Jun-19 02:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
There is also the distinct possibility that the Whigs may even *overtake* the Liberals, being up against the Socialists in the two-candidate-preferred, especially considering the small gap between the parties in recent polling.


[15-Jun-19 02:34 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The Whigs leader Plupsnup has been a big candidate in this by-election making his positions very well know on the campaign trail and twitter. It was Plupsnup who caused Horror-HQ problems by pointing out the use of 'Red-Shirts' was scarcely close to the Nazi 'Brown Shirts'.


[15-Jun-19 02:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Horror later clarified that the reference was to the TV show "Star Trek" and not the German Nazi Party of WW2


[15-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Moncrieff, the Socialists would likely be a tad more confident about their chances. Previous MP PineappleCrusher_ attempted to recontest, but diverted after it was revealed he would be ineligible and was replaced by former Liberal leader and Senator TheAudibleAsh.


[15-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Whig campaign here is also not as strong as in Sydney, where the party is standing Nothedarkweb.


[15-Jun-19 02:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Polling shows a closer race, with the Socialists on 41.5%, the Liberals on 36.6% and the Whigs on 21.9%.

An independent candidate, KernowRydh- who Channel Nine could not find any record of campaigning, is also standing.

The Greens also are standing their candidate for Cowper at the federal election, antier, who did not register in the polls.


[15-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Moncrieff, the Liberals would require 70% of Whig preferences for victory, and this is around the number that you would expect with the Whigs' how to vote cards suggesting the Liberals.


[15-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
However, the Whig vote since the polling may have declined and the Socialist vote may have increased- but there is also a factor in the Liberal candidate's favour here.


[15-Jun-19 02:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
On Thursday, after the polls were conducted in Moncrieff, the United Democratic Party endorsed TheAudibleAsh, implying he was a "committed, local candidate".


[15-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
While it's likely that a significant portion of UDP voters were probably already planning to vote Liberal, this will help TheAudibleAsh close the gap, especially considering the UDP is currently polling on 21.3%.


[15-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Both races will be very interesting, and will help show the nation's opinion on the Socialist government and more importantly, whether it will stay in power after tonight.

Anyway, you left the- well, I'm not really sure about the semantics, but, the Liberal Party, a few days ago over their name change. Were you informed of this name change? Was it voted on in any way by the party?


[15-Jun-19 03:26 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I was not informed, and it isn't just that I wasn't around either. I looked through the minutes of the meetings I didn't attend and it wasn't recorded anywhere. The party did not vote on it despite the party constitution CLEARLY stating that all matters concerning the party needed to be voted on by the party's executive council before being realised.


[15-Jun-19 03:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
The excuse I was given was that the name change occurred prior to the constitution coming into effect, but that makes no sense as it occurred after the vote on it happened.


[15-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
So from your knowledge, n4ziporriidge renamed the party unilaterally?


[15-Jun-19 03:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
ALSO, the constitution clearly is titled, "CONSTITUTION OF THE LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY"


[15-Jun-19 03:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So either the constitution is invalid or the name is. But they weren't having a bar of it.


[15-Jun-19 03:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
It seemed like he had some supporters, particularly PineappleCrusher_.


[15-Jun-19 03:29 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But the name was a very clear part of the deal which saw my former United Australia Party merge with his Liberals, which brought them to the position they are today. And to have it changed BACK, not just to any other name, but clearly to his old party's name, without consulting me, showed no regard for me, my values or the people that have supported me and did support my former party.


[15-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now that you're an independent, can you tell us about anything you're planning next?


[15-Jun-19 03:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well at the moment I plan on sitting out the rest of my term as an independent. I have no interest in any of the current parties, and do not have the time for starting another party right now. As such I have no intention of doing much else than what you see me doing now, that is being a vocal member of the Senate. Debating bills, voting for freedom, protecting Australia from this disturbing socialist government.


[15-Jun-19 03:31 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I may introduce a bill or two, I've been meaning to reintroduce my abortion bill but I can't seem to find the old draft...

Anyway, onto the Moncrieff and Sydney by-elections- there's the very real possibility that the Socialist government may lose its majority- in such an event, would you be willing to work with the Liberals against the Socialists?


[15-Jun-19 03:36 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Absolutely. Despite parting ways with the Liberals, I still support much of their agenda. I don't wish them any harm, I just felt it would be best if I left that place. Didn't want to be involved in any internal party dramas. I'm here to support liberty, I don't have the time to bother with drama that affects nothing other than personal pride.


[15-Jun-19 03:36 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But I don't imagine I'd be in a Liberal government, they wouldn't need me as I'm a Senator. However, if approached, I'd likely say yes.

[15-Jun-19 03:45 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
There was a vote on a constitution, I'm fairly certain. Perhaps I misinterpreted the vote, maybe it was like, 'that we have a constitution.' If I am misremembering even to that extent... why is there a constitution, even now, that was never voted on by anyone? That in itself is pretty... yeah pretty crazy.


[15-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
We're being told that Mr. Crusher is saying 'there was a vote on that after the name change'.


[15-Jun-19 03:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Pings are a courtesy? Ok, I mean, sure, but by your own standards, at the very least you showed me a major discourtesy by failing to do so. I don't really think anyone can blame a guy for leaving a place that's actively discourteous towards them... But even if it isn't absolutely required, surely, *surely* you want the input of each member of the executive council? if not, what are they for? Either they don't want my input or don't care for it. Another totally reasonable thing to leave for.


[15-Jun-19 03:47 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
There was no vote on the name change, to my knowledge.


[15-Jun-19 03:49 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
But yeah, nt being pinged for it is pretty poor form. I'd argue that the question even being put was disrespectful to myself and the former members of the UAP. The Liberal Democrat name was a very clear term of the merge. Much time was spent negotiating a name. And then it was just thrown out the window, to revert to *their old name*. It's a respect thing. I was shown none. So I got out.


[15-Jun-19 03:49 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Even still, i wish the Liberal party no ill fare. I just don't believe it was a place I was welcome.


[15-Jun-19 03:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Also, there is no getting around the fact that the party constitution has LIBERAL DEMOCRAT in bold across the top of it.


[15-Jun-19 03:50 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Surely the constitution is invalid. It's for a non-existent party.

The government has picked up the seat of Sydney amidst a close election battle with the Whigs and Liberals.


[17-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sydney is now the most marginal seat in the country, on a 0.7% margin.


[17-Jun-19 12:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
In Question Time, the government attempted to paint it as a disaster for the opposition, with the Treasurer stating that 'The Liberals lost 32% of the vote in Moncrieff and more than 55% in Sydney.'

What was very notable was the performance of the Whigs. The Whigs won nearly 30% in Sydney and came close to a victory.

What do you think this means for your party's future?


[17-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Plupsnup#9685
I think it means that people have only just started to wake up. I only lost the election by 16k votes and my party has jumped by 1% in the polls. I think the Socs are in an inflation bubble, support will just keep increasing, but there will be a recession, mark my words. 

My party is the the same predicament as Labor, neither of us have a person in Parliament, but i feel like the support for Labor is dying, while Whig Fever is increasing

I am hopeful for the future for me and my party

I am also glad to have made Sydney a marginal seat


[17-Jun-19 12:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Do you think that the decline of Liberal votes in what was once two safe seats for them bodes well for you?

Glad to be on here, Jayden


[17-Jun-19 01:05 PM] stu#5524
Ah, my apologies Lilo.


[17-Jun-19 01:07 PM] stu#5524
Let's start off with the good. I think they have a common-sense social policy that balances the interests of all peoples within our multicultural country while still preventing discrimination.


[17-Jun-19 01:07 PM] stu#5524
Now, the bad:


[17-Jun-19 01:07 PM] stu#5524
They have attempted to nationalise the banks, an act that I have demonstrably been opposed to as I have taken legal action against the acquisition with my team of lawyers.


[17-Jun-19 01:08 PM] stu#5524
They tore up the ANZUS alliance which places Australia into a precarious position in the Pacific geopolitical region, especially with China.


[17-Jun-19 01:09 PM] stu#5524
Finally, their continued encroachment on the economic freedoms of business owners big and small in our country will no doubt create a slippery slope down the road of governmental tyranny. That is something I simply cannot stand.

Good Answer. Do you have a specific plan to achieve this goal?


[17-Jun-19 01:16 PM] stu#5524
Well I have multiple plans.


[17-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Do you have a preferred plan?


[17-Jun-19 01:20 PM] stu#5524
Allow me to begin with one. We first need to consider where the current imbalances in our society are. We see them in the streets of urban cities whereby homelessness has remained prevalent meanwhile affluent white families live in gated confines of suburbia with a blissful ignorance. We see them in soaring costs of housing and standards of living in our cities while nothing remains to be done about it, as our next generation of Australians become increasingly worried.

We are becoming a society that favours the luxurious and extravagant excess of the wealthy few. We must seek to incentive our housing market to produce more affordable housing through high-density urban development. Further, we must seek to disincentivize the white-flight phenomenon that has created the suburban divide between the rich and poor of our country. This, I say, can be done through reforming zoning regulations to allow the market to build more housing for all Australians, and not merely the wealthy few.


[17-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Thank you for the answer. You seem to have a well thought out and solid plan of how to acheive one of your goals which is always appreciated

It began with a sense of just feeling like I was dissatisfied with how the country was going and I wanted to make change.  But the more and more I got involved the more and more I realised how difficult it was, and that was shown today with the dismissal of South Gippsland Shire and how local councils like this too often fly under the radar and are not held to account.

Alright so, my first question is about question time. This term, a well known criticism about the government is it's lack of presence during question time, usually only having a member or two present, not counting the speaker. As deputy leader do you, or the governemnt in general have a plan to improve presence? For example, i remember changing the time of question time, is something like that in the works?


[19-Jun-19 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
I definitely do think the time should be changed, and it sometime can be a bit difficult for members to consistently make the current time and I recognise that. It's not really occuring at the moment but we will be making progress.

[21-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
The center of any argument around abortion is how one defines the beginning of life. So how do you define the start of life?


[21-Jun-19 03:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Well I think the most convincing and safest guess, and I say guess deliberately, as really, outside of being God Himself, we cannot truly define life in any absolute sense, is conception.

{Reactions}
hearhear 

[21-Jun-19 03:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I want to first acknowledge and thank you for understanding that the centre of the abortion argument is how we define the beginning of human life.


[21-Jun-19 03:05 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So often it becomes about women's rights, but it really has nothing to do with it at all, at least for any sensible person.


[21-Jun-19 03:06 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Claims that pro-lifers are anti-women or that we hat a woman's right to choose is strictly nonsense, attack speech, and shows a real lack of taking the actual issue seriously and a lack of willingness to confront what the true core of the matter is which, as you say, is how to define the beginning of human life.


[21-Jun-19 03:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
For a bit more of that, some viewers might be interested to look at some discussion Lucifer and I had on twitter earlier this morning, with a few other parties involved, but yeah. Check our feeds if you care to.


[21-Jun-19 03:07 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
.


[21-Jun-19 03:10 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I'd first like to thank you for the well worded and thought out answer. As for your first answer, of course i agree that we can not truly ever absolutely define when life begins. I also agree that anyone who makes this argument about women's rights just isn't paying attention, or isn't willing to argue the actual question, the definition of the start of life. I would also like to admit a fault in my earlier arguments which is that as much as we can't tell if life begins at conception, we can't tell when conscious thought begins


[21-Jun-19 03:11 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
*nods approvingly*


[21-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I have to ask however, I don't know if you've clarified this or not, if so i've missed it and that's my fault, Do you believe abortion should still be an option in cases such as rape or threat to the mother?


[21-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
And as an add on, if not in the case of rape, how do you plan to support the mothers?


[21-Jun-19 03:19 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I would say no to cases of rape.


[21-Jun-19 03:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Absolutely in cases where carrying through with the pregnancy is a threat to the mother's life.


[21-Jun-19 03:20 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
This INCLUDES PSYCHOLOGICAL threats.


[21-Jun-19 03:22 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
So the concerns that people have with positions that support abortions in the case of rape as an exception are addressed, in that mothers who might consider suicidality as a result of going the full term can still have the option of an abortion. The pro-life position is exactly that: pro-life. That includes the mother's own life. Religious organisations also share this value, for those interested. The Catholic church most notably holds this position.


[21-Jun-19 03:24 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
In terms of supporting the mothers, well, I think whether it results in pregnancy or not, rape victims ought to receive psychological care. There are innumerous charitable organisations which seek to assist women particularly, although men as well, with such issues, even some which are specifically for women who are struggling with whether or not they want to abort. There are people trained just for these scenarios.


[21-Jun-19 03:27 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I think Australia needs an EXTREMELY more streamlined adoption network as well. Abortions, and this is the vast majority of cases, unfortunately, are undertaken due to a lack of desire to care for a child, whether due to economic constraints, career concerns, and a whole slew of other, generally speaking, excuses. If criminalised, these issues and concerns do not go away. Of course not. So alternatives, such as adoption, should be highly promoted by the government, but at the moment it's a very long, arduous and expensive process to adopt, and I think that needs to be addressed asap.


[21-Jun-19 03:29 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Even families that do choose to adopt often look overseas first, simply because its cheaper. They have the desire to make a difference in a child's life but not the funds. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this, of course. International children deserve the care of a family as much as our own children do, of course. But our government is obviously in a much better position to care for our own children than we are for other countries', and yet... Yeah, it's disappointing, to put it lightly.


[21-Jun-19 03:29 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[21-Jun-19 03:30 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969

[21-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I appreciate the amount of thought you put into the care and mental health of the mother


[21-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I also appreciate your consideration for the possibility of a mother not being willing, or simply not wishing to raise the child


[21-Jun-19 03:32 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

[21-Jun-19 03:33 PM] BellmanTGM#3331

Yes, many, but I suppose since I now have my own network I can save it for that hahaha. Also, I expect to introduce, or rather, re-introduce, my bill to criminalise abortion to parliament in the near future, so no doubt this topic will be brought up again in no time at all.

Can I just say, I was watching some of that new show by my colleague Senator Bellman and I have to say; Plupsnups is a complete idiot. I mean, he did just say he was economically illiterate.

Of course you can, what exactly about Cardinal Pell do you wish to ask about


[21-Jun-19 04:54 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Specifically, You and the liberal party have been accused of being pedophile apologists due to some comments made. Do you have any comments or statements to make about that?


[21-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I also hate to interrupt, but i'd like to introduce our second guest today, The leader of the opposition @GenericCereal everybody


[21-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
the question also goes out to him as well


[21-Jun-19 04:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well those comments are simply not true. It was the Liberal Party who pressured the Prime Minister into repealing his titles temporarily. The law is the law and I will respect the results of the appeal, however I believe he is innocent on several grounds and it is those grounds on which he is appealing the case. I do not condone pedophilia and I have said such on several occasions and so have my colleagues.


[21-Jun-19 05:00 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Of course. So, given that you had to remind the government to revoke his honors after they had torn into you and your party over this matter do you feel that they are simply reacting for political purposes rather then reacting legitimately?


[21-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
It’s for political purposes, absolutely.


[21-Jun-19 05:01 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Absolutely. If that is truly what is happening, then it is disgusting

Another big issue facing us currently, is abortion. Do the two of you mind sharing personal and party positions on it? Given the controversy surrounding the issue i understand if you wish not to comment


[21-Jun-19 05:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well if you heard my recent speech on abortion; I believe my position is quite clear. Abortion is murder and if the left wants to mirror the policies of Europe, then why not adopt further restrictions to abortion as done in Germany, Scandinavia and several other European Nations.


[21-Jun-19 05:05 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969

One more question before we start wrapping up, do you have any bills or initiatives or anything of the sort coming up you wish to take a moment to mention or talk about?


[21-Jun-19 05:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
I always like to keep my bill proposals a secret, but I have made it my duty to propose at least 1 new piece of legislation weekly. Last week I missed, but you’ll see two excellent bills much like the GST-Free Electricity Bill which has passed the senate and will reduce the average Australian family’s power bill by 10%.

BREAKING NEWS:


[12-Jul-19 08:08 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Liberal Senator AussieConservative also known as Griffo has admitted to lying to the Australian people during his time as leader of the Australian Conservatives.


[12-Jul-19 08:09 PM] Matt Monti#4771
During a debate with Independent Senator Bellman, Griffo said "I described myself as a fascist for political points."


[12-Jul-19 08:09 PM] Matt Monti#4771
How can the Australian People have confidence in a man who has admitted he is willing to lie to the nation in order to gain political points.


[12-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I will note that Griffo apologised for these lies, however an apology does not negate the actions he took and would still presumably take now.


[12-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The debate in question is currently taking place on #the-independent. If you wish to watch Bellman destroy Griffo please tune in now.


[12-Jul-19 08:12 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Any other developments from this debate will be reported on later tonight in "Canberra Bubble" with me, Alex Monti. I hope you will join me later tonight.

**BREAKING NEWS**


[20-Jul-19 04:32 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Hello I'm Alex Monti welcome to Channel 9's afternoon bulletin


[20-Jul-19 04:33 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Our top story, a new scandal in the race for the seat of Mayo as Gawlergate becomes a major issue for Liberal Candidate Riley8583


[20-Jul-19 04:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Today when campaign in the Northern Adelaide Suburb the Liberal candidate made several references to the area being part of "rural SA". SA-BEST MP MattMonti was quick to point out that Gawler is in fact part of the great metropolitan area of Adelaide and therefore not rural.


[20-Jul-19 04:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
This mishap has lead to renewed claims of "Carpetbagging" against Riley.


[20-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Matt Monti#4771
In other news, MattMonti made direct attacks at his Liberal opponent at a campaign rally in Port Augusta.


[20-Jul-19 04:37 PM] Matt Monti#4771
(M: somewhere that is actually fucking rural.)


[20-Jul-19 04:38 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The incumbent MP responded to Riley's claims of Matt pushing a "Left-Wing agenda" and being an "Inner-city green".


[20-Jul-19 04:41 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The member took harshly to what these attacks, calling his opponent an "idiot" and claiming it is *he* who does not understand regional SA because he comes from Queensland and only moved to South Australia in preparation for his run in the recent Mayo By-Election.


[20-Jul-19 04:41 PM] Matt Monti#4771
In the early days of this general election campaign, Mayo seems to be one of the most hotly contested seats.


[20-Jul-19 04:42 PM] Matt Monti#4771
We'll have more for you later. For now, I'm Alex Monti. Thank you for watching Australia.

We are hearing from an anonymous source that soon to be released polls show a huge Liberal surge in the TPP count.


[21-Jul-19 03:47 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The source claims polling shows the Liberal Party on 53% to the Socialist party's 47%!

This seems to indicate the Liberal Party may on their may to Government next week. However with a large amount of independent and minor party candidates, this information may be useless.

Ok I know I just signed off but now we are back to discuss the official polling that was just released on #twitter


[21-Jul-19 03:52 PM] Matt Monti#4771
it seems that the TPP figure we got was for Lib v UDP, and the Lib v Soc is even worse, sitting at 53/46


[21-Jul-19 03:53 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Another big finding is the Labor party sitting on 1%


[21-Jul-19 03:54 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Regional Parties SGN and SAB are both up 1%, with other minor parties doing well in this as well.


[21-Jul-19 03:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
PTV and RSP both sitting on 4%, and the soon to be merged Greens and AGP are sitting on a combined 11%.


[21-Jul-19 03:56 PM] Matt Monti#4771
this poll shows no party has a clear mandate, with the soc down 9% and every minor party either up or stagnant.


[21-Jul-19 03:57 PM] Matt Monti#4771
For now that is all we have. I'm Alex Monti. Thank you for watching.

So, let's review the polls and see where that would put Parliament.


[26-Jul-19 10:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
4 seats out of the 7 being contested were polled.


[26-Jul-19 10:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Mayo showed a dead heat between the Liberal and SA-BEST candidate, Cunningham a slight Agrarian lead, Nicholls an 11-point South Gippsland lead, and Canberra a UDP lead.


[26-Jul-19 10:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
The remaining 3 seats are Pearce, Melbourne and Cowper, all likely rather easy to predict.


[26-Jul-19 10:39 AM] Deleted User#0000

(this is a thought experiment and not a prediction)


[26-Jul-19 10:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
On these numbers, with Mayo's results being highly questionable, Parliament would look like this-


[26-Jul-19 10:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
:liberal: 6
:udp: 5
:sgn: 1
:agrarian: 1
✊ 1


[26-Jul-19 10:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Of course, this only adds up to 14 as Sydney is vacant.


[26-Jul-19 10:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
There are a few possibilities here, some of which hinge on Sydney and Mayo.


[26-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberals could form government with the UDP, the UDP could attempt to form government with minor parties.


[26-Jul-19 10:44 AM] Deleted User#0000

The quota for election is 26%.


[26-Jul-19 10:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberals are on 46%, the UDP on 33% and independent Bellman on 21%.


[26-Jul-19 10:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
Immediately, the following are elected-
#1 :liberal: tobycool2001_1
#2 :udp: advancedgaming12
BellmanTGM 21%
Liberal 20%
UDP 7%


[26-Jul-19 10:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, this would all ultimately depend on UDP preferences.


[26-Jul-19 10:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Bellman would need at least 5%, and the Liberals would need 6%.


[26-Jul-19 10:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
More likely, however, neither reach the quota, with the first placed one just being elected.


[26-Jul-19 10:49 AM] Deleted User#0000

**ELECTION AFTERMATH**


[28-Jul-19 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Australia, in the wake of yesterday's election, seemingly has a hung Parliament.


[28-Jul-19 11:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
The UDP and Liberals, on election night, both had 5 seats, with minor parties holding 4 seats, with Sydney vacant, creating this Parliament-

[30-Jul-19 12:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
The UDP would need 3 more votes. It seems unlikely that a grand coalition between the UDP and the LIberals has been formed, so let's crack open the crossbench.

However, in confidence and supply, it could be doable.


[30-Jul-19 01:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Agrarians, however, may not want to be in government, as they have been looking to form a new Labor Party, which would leave the final coalition as the most likely.


[30-Jul-19 01:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
However, that has lots of problems too.


[30-Jul-19 01:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Namely the fact that you're expecting Bsharri the Revolutionary Socialist to work with BloodyChrome.

First this morning, Liberal Senator tobycool2001_1 has proposed a vote of no confidence in the government.


[01-Aug-19 10:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
This is likely to pass the Senate, although it has been noted that this is not binding.


[01-Aug-19 10:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberals are naturally likely to support this, especially considering it was moved by a Liberal and 2 out of 3 Liberal Senators are openly supporting it in debate.

Independent BellmanTGM has also led his support to the motion.

Newly elected Senator DavidSwifty has resigned, claiming to be "a illegal immigrant named Juan", being chased down.

This means that the Liberals, if they do not appoint a candidate to this casual vacancy in time, may not muster a majority in the Senate, which would be an embarrassment.


[01-Aug-19 10:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Sydney votes on Saturday, and there are 4 candidates in the running.


[01-Aug-19 11:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
Liberal candidate Riley8583, United Democratic candidate PaulKeating13, Agrarian candidate stalintwo, and independent gavingrotegut.


[01-Aug-19 11:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Riley8583 previously contested Mayo at the federal election, and polled 70% in the recent poll.


[01-Aug-19 11:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
PaulKeating13 declared their candidacy last night, and was not in the most recent poll.


[01-Aug-19 11:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
stalintwo is a former MP for Sydney for the Liberal Democrats, who is now seeking the seat as an Agrarian candidate.


[01-Aug-19 11:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
stalintwo is polling on 25%.


[01-Aug-19 11:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
And finally, perhaps the most curious candidate is gavingrotegut. Former Socialist MP for Fairfax, he contested the Moncrieff by-election, but failed to win against TheAudibleAsh.


[01-Aug-19 11:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
gavingrotegut is seeking the Transport Matters nominating, running on a campaign for a bullet train.


[01-Aug-19 11:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
However, Transport Matters did not let him into the party, and he will contest as an independent.

The Liberal Senator had moved a motion to condemn the Government for working with the "Radical RSP" member Bsharri.


[01-Aug-19 09:34 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Unfortunately for the Liberal Party these motions are essentially meaningless and serve no purpose other than political point scoring.

After United Democratic candidate PaulKeating13, a change was indeed expected in polling, and it has shown.


[02-Aug-19 12:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Liberals have fallen 20 points, although they are still on 51%.


[02-Aug-19 12:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
The UDP is on 25%, with the Agrarians down 6 to 17% and the independent up 1 to 7%.


[02-Aug-19 12:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
There have been a slew of endorsements in the race, mainly directed to PaulKeating13.


[02-Aug-19 12:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
MattMonti's SA-BEST, the Revolutionary Socialists, The Australian Whigs, the South Gippsland Network and perhaps most interestingly, the Australian Labor Party, have all endorsed PaulKeating13.


[02-Aug-19 12:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Australian Greens have also endorsed the Agrarian candidate stalintwo- unsurprising, considering their merger, and independent Senator BellmanTGM has endorsed Riley8583.


[02-Aug-19 12:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
But the Labor endorsement may have surprised a fair few people.


[02-Aug-19 12:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
After all, after the party failed to stand candidates in the most recent federal election and with the review of eligibility, most people presumed the party was done for.


[02-Aug-19 12:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed, certainly the Agrarians and Greens did, who have applied for registration under the new name of the Australian Labor Party.


[02-Aug-19 12:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
The man who endorsed PaulKeating13, fartoomuchpressure, has previously contested various elections in the seat of Pearce, and we contacted him to ask about the endorsement.

If this new endorsement from Labor is indicative of anything, we may well see them successfully hold onto registration.

Magnificent transition from Brisbane City. Their defenders were able to get the ball out quickly and their forwards got a shot on goal as a result. Excellent finish as well and now Brisbane City are up.


[02-Aug-19 06:05 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So not much happening now Brisbane Lions have the ball but they can't seem to make anything on this possession.


[02-Aug-19 06:06 PM] Matt Monti#4771
And it's Half Time here in Brisbane with City on top early with the single goal. So going into Half Time it's City 1, Lions 0

Riley8583, MP for Sydney.


[03-Aug-19 09:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
The people have voted, and the ballots have been tallied.


[03-Aug-19 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ultimately, UDP candidate PaulKeating13 put up a harsh fight, coming a close second with a 0.8% margin, but just narrowly missed out.


[03-Aug-19 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
But a lot of controversy has been involved surrounding the Agrarian Party, who put PaulKeating13 last. AnswerMeNow1, South Gippsland Network MP for Nicholls, called the decision "unprincipled", with Mad_Bear_O_Melbourne stating that "We just put in a candidate who wasn't really as focused as we hoped. Stalin was fresh out of Liberals and had a lot of stuff to work out behind the scenes. He wasn't prepared for it yet and it showed."


[03-Aug-19 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
He went on to state that "I didn't think it mattered to the voters of Sydney as much as it did," and pondering resignation before deciding against that.


[03-Aug-19 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
The results for Sydney have not been formally confirmed, as the writs for election have not yet been returned. Once that occurs, a few things are likely to occur.


[03-Aug-19 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
First of all, Riley8583 will be sworn in by the Speaker as MP for Sydney.


[03-Aug-19 09:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
And secondly, the AEC is likely to handle new party registrations, of which there has been a backlog of since the general election.


[03-Aug-19 09:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Australian Labor Party and the Public Transport Party Victoria are both extremely likely to be deregistered, with the merger between the Australian Greens and the Agrarians likely to be confirmed.


[03-Aug-19 09:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
The Socialist Party will also be undergoing a review of eligibility, although the conclusion of that has not yet lapsed. The Socialist Party still maintains an MP in the Senate, rhaums, and so if the Socialists became deregistered, she may wish to reregister the party- or simply join a new one.

After the writs were returned for the Sydney supplementary election, the AEC was finally capable to act on a backlog of party registration.


[04-Aug-19 06:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
The AEC has deregistered Public Transport Party Victoria and the Labor Party after they failed to submit applications for reviews of eligibility.

[05-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Hello and welcome to A-League Recap this Monday evening,


[05-Aug-19 05:10 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I'm Alex Monti and let's look through our A-League games this weekend.


[05-Aug-19 05:10 PM] Matt Monti#4771
We start with the Friday night Brisbane Derby, where Brisbane City took down the Brisbane Lions 1-0


[05-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Next we have a commanding win for the Shepparton Fruit Pickers against Canberra United. The final score there was 3-1.

Sharks on top followed by the Furit Pickers, Mariners and stars, with the Falcons, Brisbane City, Hong Kong and the Hustlers rounding out our top 8.


[05-Aug-19 05:30 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So that's all for A-League recap tonight. We hope you'll join us on Friday night when Brisbane Lions host Port Adelaide.

Welcome to A Biography of the MP for Cowper, with your host, Natalie Bronze.


[14-Aug-19 05:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Manly-Kitten, the honourable member for Cowper- and I mean that politely, and not necessarily sincerely, has a long political history.


[14-Aug-19 05:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
And  the first part of it is that he's actually Manly_Kitten and not Manly-Kitten you GORMLESS RUBES.


[14-Aug-19 05:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Actually no, he's actually Manly-Kitten, according to a helpful intern.


[14-Aug-19 05:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not that that's relevant, STEVE.

Anyway, back to Manly-Kitten.


[14-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Manly first joined the United Australia Party and stood in the Brisbane by-election against Social Democratic candidate neogenesis_W.


[14-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Except the Social Democratic candidate was actually neogenesis_Q. I FOOLED YOU AGAIN.


[14-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I've recieved a letter from a smart-arse intern who says that I should get on with the show.

You know what, why don't I get on with my foot up your arse? HUH?!


[14-Aug-19 05:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Anyway, Manly-Kitten won the seat off retiring SDP candidate BHjr132, triggering a general election as the government lost their majority.


[14-Aug-19 05:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
The government remained unstable, and was weakened even more after Horror-HQ defected and the Centre Alliance withdrew confidence.


[14-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
But at the next election, the Social Democrats absolutely obliterated their competition, winning 9 of the 19 seats.


[14-Aug-19 05:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
The resulting landslide meant that Cowper was won by the SDP on a 4.6% margin, against the UAP candidate Manly_Kitten.

[14-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
At the next election, however, following the merger of the Liberals and the UAP, Manly_Kitten recontested Cowper as a Liberal Democrat.


[14-Aug-19 05:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
He won the seat resoundingly, winning 65% of the primary vote.


[14-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
At the next federal election, despite the LDP becoming the Liberals, Manly_Kitten won a record 90% of the primary vote against token opposition from the Agrarians, and then, on election night, joined the Agrarians.

Welcome to Australia's Next Top Senator! I'm Natalie Bronze.


[15-Aug-19 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Following the expulsion of Socialist-turned-independent Senator rhaums for inactivity, a vacancy has arisen in the Senate.


[15-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
So, let's review the seat up for grabs.


[15-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Socialist Senator NGSpy was first elected at the May 2019 election.


[15-Aug-19 05:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
When he resigned, he was replaced by Eehee333, who was unfortunately hit by a train during their tenure.


[15-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is where rhaums comes in, who filled in for Eehee.


[15-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
But, now that the Socialists have gone the same way as my faith in society, the seat can't go to a casual vacancy as it previously has done.


[15-Aug-19 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
So, it's time for a countback.


[15-Aug-19 05:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, there are a few people who could get it.


[15-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
The most likely choice is the number 2 on the Socialist ticket, bongznbeerz.


[15-Aug-19 05:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
However, their last activity in Australian politics was handing out this leaflet...

[15-Aug-19 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
As we can see, the Australian Greens are next in line.


[15-Aug-19 06:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
So the seat, in that case, would go to Number 1 on the Greens senate ticket, former MP for Cowper, hk-laichar, who is now a member of the Labor Party.


[15-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, it would probably stop here since if hk-laichar accepted, they would take the Senate seat, and if they didn't, it would go to Labor.


[15-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not because hk-laichar is in Labor, but because the Greens merged into Labor.


[15-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
But for fun and because I need a hobby, let's keep going into this godforsaken hellhole.


[15-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Next is the Social Democrats, who have, as number one on their ticket, MattMonti.


[15-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
So MattMonti, MP for Mayo, could choose to go into the Senate or not.


[15-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
But if she didn't, then we go to number 2 on the SDP ticket, StratorDE.


[15-Aug-19 06:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
StratorDE is the former MP for Perth.


[15-Aug-19 06:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
And that's about all the information we have on them.


[15-Aug-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
We'd talk about SmartFreak and ARichTeaBiscuit, but all we know about them is that they're called SmartFreak and ARichTeaBiscuit.


[15-Aug-19 06:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Next up, we'd have...

Bongznbeerz has 48 hours to accept the seat, which may not occur, and if it does not, a second recount shall take place.

As we touched on earlier, the people likely to take that seat are hk-laichar, the Australian Labor Party, MattMonti, StratorDE, ARichTeaBiscuit or even fucking Plupsnup.

hk-laichar, the former MP for Cowper, is now seemingly a Senator, which may break this chain finally.

At least until LeChevalierMal-Fait, a Liberal Senator with a 28.6% voting turnout is expelled.

[24-Aug-19 05:04 PM] Matt Monti#4771

So, upcoming is the Lingiari by-election, but it isn't really a by-election.


[27-Aug-19 06:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
A by-election is defined, according to Google as "an election held in a single political constituency to fill a vacancy arising during a government's term of office."


[27-Aug-19 06:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, this rather upsets the point I was going to make.


[27-Aug-19 06:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
But let's make it anyway!


[27-Aug-19 06:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Imagine the definition was 'to fill a vacancy of a seat at a general election'.


[27-Aug-19 06:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now, that wouldn't quite work, since DirtySaiyan wasn't elected.


[27-Aug-19 06:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
So, this by-election is more of a supplementary election, but Google doesn't define that.


[27-Aug-19 06:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
But I think it's more like a suppository election.

An elected MP will be shoved up the rectum of the people of Lingiari, and they don't really get a say in it, they just have haemorrhoids, which in this case, is a metaphor for when your local MP resigns to sit on the High Court.

Thank you very much for coming.


[02-Sep-19 04:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I'm here to announce that Change Australia is officially disbanded. Under the powers given to me in the CA constitution I used executive action to call a vote. Which then passed. I am sorry to all of our supporters, but I couldn't be the leader you needed. I'm sorry.


[02-Sep-19 04:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I will finish my term as the MP for Mayo as an Independent. I will then decide my future at a later date.  Until that time I'd like to thank you all for your support and hope you find a leader someday.

Lyin’ Liberals! Cries former Lingiari candidate Woof after the Liberal Party announces their candidate for Lingiari!


[03-Sep-19 05:29 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Former Change Australia Candidate for Lingiari, Woof, has cried foul after the he was reportedly given a guarantee from Liberal Deputy Leader and Senate President Tobycool.


[03-Sep-19 05:32 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Well it looks like that was all in vain, as Woof was back stabbed by the Liberal Party and forced to drop out of the race. Not a good look for a party that wants to be a credible option for government.


[03-Sep-19 05:34 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Seems like more chaos on the right, as they try to crush anyone who stands in their way with lies and dirty tricks.

Honestly its more just to prove a point. I'm one of the people who is the most passionate about this sim. But it doesn't really matter. Its a popularity contest.

*'Weed, Wine & Politics intro plays'*


[27-Nov-19 06:30 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Hello and welcome to the relaunch party for Channel Nine here on ‘Weed, Wine & Politics’ with me, Alex Monti.


[27-Nov-19 06:30 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Tonight we’re getting back into the grove with a classic episode of WWP with some new guests to have a chat with.


[27-Nov-19 06:33 PM] Matt Monti#4771
We’re gonna start with a segment I’m calling “Let’s talk about it”.


[27-Nov-19 06:33 PM] Matt Monti#4771
First up, LGBT Sex-Ed, let’s talk about it.


[27-Nov-19 06:34 PM] Matt Monti#4771
There has been a fierce debate over the issue this week pitting conservatives like Riley8583, Griffo and Prime Minister Porage against more progressive thinkers like LOTO Dyljam, Youmaton and MattMonti. The heart of the argument is at what age children should be made aware of LGBT people and the idea of being something other than heterosexual or cisgender. Well the answer is simple, as soon as possible.


[27-Nov-19 06:34 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The only thing that a lack of education on LGBT issues does to a child is give them a negative outlook on LGBT people or the idea that they may be LGBT. If children aren’t LGBT then they become aware that these people exist and learn to accept their differences. If they *are* LGBT then it shows these children it’s ok to be different and gives them the ability to learn more about themselves and others like them.


[27-Nov-19 06:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
My final thought, just teach kids about LGBT people, there is literally no downside to this idea, other than it may mean these Children don’t inherit the prejudice their parents have.


[27-Nov-19 06:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Next up, Public Transport in SA, let’s talk about it.


[27-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The Marshall Liberal Government in South Australia plans to privatize the Train and Tram network of Adelaide, making every service offered by Adelaide Metro privatized in some form. This is a real shame. MP for Mayo MattMonti has been campaigning for federal investment in an expansion of the public transport network in SA to link regional communities to Adelaide and each other.


[27-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Unfortunately if this privatization goes ahead this task will become harder as the project will need to work with private companies managing the Train and Tram networks in order to implement it’s planned expansions to these networks.


[27-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
My final thought, stop the privatization, we’ve seen from Victoria that when you privatizes these services it only brings costs up and quality down. Mr Marshall, stop this foolish privatization and instead support the Member for Mayo’s plan to invest more in SA transport and make the State a better place to live and invest.


[27-Nov-19 06:37 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Well now that I’ve got that off my chest let’s welcome my guests for this evening, the Member for Canberra and Leader of SDP, @Youmaton , and UDP Senator for Queensland, @Lucifer Morningstar .


[27-Nov-19 06:37 PM] Youmaton#1190

[27-Nov-19 06:38 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Now at the request of Youmaton we will be holding off on the Weed until later in the show.


[27-Nov-19 06:38 PM] Matt Monti#4771
BUT WE'VE STILL GOT WINE!


[27-Nov-19 06:38 PM] Matt Monti#4771
*audience cheers and as Matt pours three glasses of wine*


[27-Nov-19 06:39 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So Youmaton, how've you been since your return to politics?


[27-Nov-19 06:42 PM] Youmaton#1190
Rather well, though busy as always with parliamentary life as you two know so well. I truly missed being a representative of any kind whilst I had to leave my duties for those short few months, however I am glad I am back and serving not only the people of Canberra, but Australia as a whole.


[27-Nov-19 06:44 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Wonderful to hear. Now you returned to politics in a big way by reforming the SDP and winning the seat of Canberra. Were you a bit rusty on the campaign trail at first, or was it like second nature to come back into campaign life?


[27-Nov-19 06:48 PM] Matt Monti#4771
It seems we may have lost Youma so we'll move on. Senator Morningstar, night I star by congratulating you on your election to the Senate after a brief stint as Clerk. Was it hard to suddenly become Apolitical after becoming Clerk?


[27-Nov-19 06:50 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Thank you. It was difficult, I never realized how strong the temptation was to argue views and right and wrong with people


[27-Nov-19 06:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I think we know that feeling, especially in these times. Now you started as the Senator for South Australia before becoming Clerk, then after your time as Clerk you moved to Queensland and have become the Senator for that state. Why the move out of SA?


[27-Nov-19 06:54 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Mostly a change in where i spend my time, but SA is also currently being represented by a very capable senator and i wouldn't want to change that


[27-Nov-19 06:56 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Of course referring to Horror-HQ. Now be honest with me here, is it hard to be in Queensland without FUIC? Or do you have a stash with you now?


[27-Nov-19 06:57 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I have secured a secret stash, yes


[27-Nov-19 06:58 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Excellent, well please don't share it around because we can't have Queenslanders raiding SA's FUIC supplies.


[27-Nov-19 06:59 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Now on a more serious note, as I mentioned in my opening segment we're having a national debate currently about LGBT Sex-Ed in Schools. What are your thoughts on this?


[27-Nov-19 07:02 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
I believe that Sex-Ed as it relates to LGBT should not be any different, and should be provided fully and as much as the equivalent for straight sex ed


[27-Nov-19 07:03 PM] Matt Monti#4771
What about the argument that exposure to LGBT Sex-Ed could negatively impact on non-LGBT students? Is there any merit to this argument?


[27-Nov-19 07:05 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
None. Frankly, if children are so sensitive they can't handle the subject, they're already going to struggle in life anyway


[27-Nov-19 07:06 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Excellent, well thank you for your time, I think I'll let you go now enjoy your evening. I hope to have you back sometime soon.


[27-Nov-19 07:11 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
Glad to be here

[29-Jan-20 09:06 PM] Anacornda#0630
I think it was a bit of surprise when Dyljam and Porridge resigned, but I think these by-elections will be interesting, with Denison going to the SDP or ALP and Brisbane I think it might remain Lib or flip to the Nats, what about you?


[29-Jan-20 09:06 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Look, I was shocked to hear two former PM's resign from Parliament


[29-Jan-20 09:07 PM] Matt Monti#4771
But, it's gonna be exciting so... I don't really mind.

Now before we ask your opinion Prime Minister, any song requests?

Icehouse - Great Southern Land
When "Great Southern Land" was released as the first single from the Primitive Man album in 1982, a video for it was filmed in a disused sandstone quarry in the Kuringai National Park near Sydney. Then, in 1989, when the song met its first release as a single in North America...

*returns to the couches*


[29-Jan-20 09:09 PM] NGSpy#8096
Also, I'd just like to say that personally I am saddened by the resignations of the former deputy pm dyljam as he was a good colleague and also the former leader of the opposition porridge. They were great parliamentarians and will be missed.


[29-Jan-20 09:10 PM] Anacornda#0630
I have to ask you Mr. Prime Minister, if there is a new SDP or ALP member taking either of the seats, will they be put into a Cabinet position at all?


[29-Jan-20 09:11 PM] NGSpy#8096
Absolutely! I encourage a bigger cabinet to help me make important decisions for the future of Australia. It helps spread out the roles and encourages more diverse views in the cabinet.

So recently, Riley was named as the Leader of the Opposition, with the National Party now seemingly the main right leaning party of Australia at this moment. What are our takes on that?

[29-Jan-20 09:26 PM] Anacornda#0630
Riley as Leader of the Opposition is interesting, but I don't think that they will be able to defeat the Social Democratic Government will how it is going currently, but he'll have to prove himself in Question Time on Sunday, see if he's as good as people claim


[29-Jan-20 09:26 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Indeed.


[29-Jan-20 09:26 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Prime Minister?


[29-Jan-20 09:26 PM] NGSpy#8096
I personally feel that the chambers of parliament are going to get way more heated with Riley as the leader of the opposition, and there will be way less potential bi-partisan bills. I feel as though our cabinet can pull through and combat the Opposition well in sight of the next General Election. It is a while, but worth thinking about.


[29-Jan-20 09:27 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I remember when the Nationals were just a 2 person party, and now they have taken over the liberals, which was very unpredicted, so who knows what will happen.


[29-Jan-20 09:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
*drinks from glass of noot whisky*


[29-Jan-20 09:27 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Yes it's quite interesting isn't it? Personally I'm quite sad to see the more moderate and cooperative Liberal Party take a step back from leading the right in Australia. I just hope the Nationals will step up now and tone down their rhetoric to actually be a constructive opposition.


[29-Jan-20 09:27 PM] NGSpy#8096

[29-Jan-20 09:27 PM] JAYDEN#5487

[29-Jan-20 09:30 PM] Matt Monti#4771
First one... 
"Claiming that the National Party denies climate change is factually incorrect"


[29-Jan-20 09:30 PM] Anacornda#0630
Okay that does sound like something the he would say


[29-Jan-20 09:31 PM] NGSpy#8096
It's pretty real to me. That's very Riley.


[29-Jan-20 09:31 PM] JAYDEN#5487
True! We have seen this in the house currently with the nationals voting no to a climate emergency declaration


[29-Jan-20 09:31 PM] Matt Monti#4771

I don't think he has said that


[29-Jan-20 09:32 PM] NGSpy#8096
If that is in relation to the dairy regulation bill that is extremely false.


[29-Jan-20 09:32 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I feel like this is true, and my guess is the debate on the dairy regulation bill


[29-Jan-20 09:32 PM] NGSpy#8096
Conclusion: It is fake.


[29-Jan-20 09:33 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yes I think it is fake on second thoughts


[29-Jan-20 09:33 PM] JAYDEN#5487

Would it go to the house or the senate?


[29-Jan-20 09:44 PM] Anacornda#0630
I'd expect Senate, considering the Minister for LGBTQIA affairs is there


[29-Jan-20 09:45 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I believe, the PM would deliver it on behalf of the whole Parliament


[29-Jan-20 09:45 PM] Matt Monti#4771
At Least in my opinion


[29-Jan-20 09:45 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Because Senator Slater is in the senate but the house of representatives would allow for more debate. Either way I hope that I recieve an appologeee

Prime Minister, can you tell us, will there be an apology from your government this term?


[29-Jan-20 09:48 PM] NGSpy#8096
This government will issue an apology to all LGBTQIA+ Australian people who have been oppressed by previous governments or by society in general. In order for Australia to be great we need everyone to feel appreciated by society instead of oppressed like the LGBTQIA+ community has before!


[29-Jan-20 09:48 PM] Matt Monti#4771

[29-Jan-20 09:49 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Will you introduce it or Senator Slater?


[29-Jan-20 09:49 PM] NGSpy#8096
It would make sense for Senator Slater to do it because he is the minister for LGBTQIA+ Affairs.


[29-Jan-20 09:50 PM] NGSpy#8096
But if my cabinet decides otherwise, we can introduce it in the house of representatives instead.


[29-Jan-20 09:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Well I guess you'll have to keep us posted Prime Minister


[29-Jan-20 09:51 PM] NGSpy#8096

After several days of complaints from members of the community and even with an almost week long break from the sim, Tobycool has still drummed up enough anger in some corners of the community to get himself in hot water.

The Motion requires 7 seconders to go to a Meta referendum and currently has 3 seconders at the time of broadcast.


[03-Feb-20 08:57 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The Community will likely get a bit toxic if this motion does make it to a referendum, and members may want to avoid the discord if it does get toxic, for their own personal wellbeing.


[03-Feb-20 08:58 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I'll keep you updated on any developments as they come.

Welcome to **Channel Nine's Election Night special**


[08-Feb-20 10:42 PM] Matt Monti#4771
In a somewhat unprecedented situation, the AEC has said official results will not be published for today's by-elections in Denison and Brisbane until tomorrow.


[08-Feb-20 10:42 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So we here at Nine decided we'd let you see the results of our exit poll tonight, to give you some sort of indication of how tomorrow could turn out.


[08-Feb-20 10:43 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Of course please take these results with a grain of salt as they are only what we could get a number of polling places around both electorates.


[08-Feb-20 10:43 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Let's Start with Brisbane.


[08-Feb-20 10:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
**MattMonti (SDP):** 33.15%
**RMSteve (LIB):** 18.91%
**Plupsnup (LRP):** 7.39%
**Winston_Wilhelmus (NAT):** 21.24%
**My13InchDuck (IND):** 6.14%
**FZVIC (LAB):** 3.09%
BabyYodaVevo (IND): 10.06%


[08-Feb-20 10:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So on a TPP we get a result looking like this: 
**MattMonti (SDP):** 54.59%
**Winston_Wilhelmus (NAT):** 45.41%


[08-Feb-20 10:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So from our exit poll in Brisbane Channel Nine Predicts:
**BRISBANE: SDP GAIN** :sdp:

[08-Feb-20 10:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Next up, Denison


[08-Feb-20 10:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Our Exit poll of booths around the electorate gave us the following first preference count:
**dyljam (IND):** 35.51%
**jgm0228 (SDP):** 17.97%
**Superpacman04 (NAT):** 40.38%
**TheNorthernMarshall (LAB):** 3.56%
**ComanderCody2002 (LIB):** 2.67


[08-Feb-20 10:59 PM] Matt Monti#4771
That gives us a TPP of:
**Dyljam (IND):** 53.27%
**Superpacman04 (NAT):** 46.73%

[08-Feb-20 11:00 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So from our exit poll in Denison Channel Nine Predicts: 
**DENISON: INDEPENDENT GAIN***


[08-Feb-20 11:00 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The asterisk indicates that it's a party change, but same MP


[08-Feb-20 11:01 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So that's all tonight from Channel Nine's election centre: Our predictions are **Brisbane: SDP** and **Denison: Independent**


[08-Feb-20 11:06 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Before we go, if those results pan out the state of the House will be:
:sdp: 7
🇮  3
:National: 3
:liberal: 2


[08-Feb-20 11:06 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The Senate would remain the same at:
:sdp: 3
:Labor: 1
:liberal: 2
:National: 1

Labor Candidate for Mayo @Explosivo2002 attacks former Mayo MP and SDP Chair @Matt Monti over his record on film during his time in office.


[13-Feb-20 05:57 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The Candidate was quick to attack Mr Monti for delivering the movie Cats, however the MP for Mayo from the 13th of July to 20th of December 2019, was quick to point out his excellent record


[13-Feb-20 05:57 PM] Matt Monti#4771
with films like Avengers Endgame, Parasite, Joker, and Toy Story 4 all coming out under during his time as MP.


[13-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The scuffle has left the Labor Candidate red-faced, having lost his first public argument with the current Mayo front-runner.


[13-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Matt Monti#4771
It seems however film may be the only attack point between the candidates, as they agree on almost everything else.

**BREAKING NEWS:**


[19-Feb-20 08:35 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Liberty Reform Candidate for Mayo, Plupsnup, has just released his How to Vote Card for the by-election and it has huge ramifications for the result.


[19-Feb-20 08:37 AM] Matt Monti#4771
You may remember their campaign in both Mayo and Brisbane against Fascism, being proudly anti-fascist. The fascists they claimed to be against were the Nationals, and their HTV in Brisbane backed that up, placing the Nationals and their supporters in the Liberal Party towards to bottom of the ballot.


[19-Feb-20 08:37 AM] Matt Monti#4771
However, in this election the LRP seem to have abandoned their anti-fascist pride and given second preference the Liberal Candidate BloodyChrome, who, if elected, would enter into coalition with the very fascists the LRP claim to be against.


[19-Feb-20 08:40 AM] Matt Monti#4771
These preferences could end up being the deciding factor, with the ALP likely to preference the SDP, and the Libs and Nats likely to 2nd preference each other


[19-Feb-20 08:41 AM] Matt Monti#4771
The only true question seems to be who the 2 Party Preferred will be.


[19-Feb-20 08:41 AM] Matt Monti#4771
In Brisbane it was expected to be an SDP v NAT contest, however LRP preferences gave BabyYodaVevo an edge and ended up swaying the election to the independent candidate.


[19-Feb-20 08:42 AM] Matt Monti#4771
This election seems to be an SDP v LIB contest. However, with the collapse of the Liberals National vote, the rise of the Nationals Party, and the LRP preferences, the candidate to go up against the SDP in a TPP is no done deal.


[19-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Matt Monti#4771
It would seem the Nationals have no chance of winning, given they are below the SDP on the LRP HTV, but if the Liberals manage to top the Nats and make it to the TPP there is a real chance that BC, a former UDP Leader and staunch opponent to the Liberal Party, may just win Mayo for the very party he fought so long against.


[19-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Matt Monti#4771
One can't help but see a pattern beginning to emerge, of MattMonti getting the most 1st Preference votes, and Plupsnup being there to ensure someone else wins the contest. The LRP say they are anti-fascist and want to work with the Government if possible, but their actions seems to show a different side of this opportunistic party.


[19-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Matt Monti#4771

So... last time we brought you an election prediction we... uh...


[20-Feb-20 09:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
let's just say it wasn't great.


[20-Feb-20 09:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
We got both of the results wrong. One was quite close. The other one our predicted winner didn't even make the TPP


[20-Feb-20 09:48 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So this time, please take our predictions with a grain, or two thousand, of salt.


[20-Feb-20 09:48 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So tomorrow we will finally get results from the Mayo By-Election.


[20-Feb-20 09:48 PM] Matt Monti#4771
For now, let's make some predictions!


[20-Feb-20 09:48 PM] Matt Monti#4771
.


[20-Feb-20 09:48 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So,


[20-Feb-20 09:48 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The Candidates in the race are:


[20-Feb-20 09:49 PM] Matt Monti#4771
:sdp: **The Hon. MattMonti AO:** Former MP for Mayo, Senator for SA and SDP Leader.


[20-Feb-20 09:49 PM] Matt Monti#4771
:liberal: **The Hon. Bloodychrome AC:** Former MP for Lingiari and UDP Leader.


[20-Feb-20 09:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
:National: **My13InchDuck:** Former Nationals Candidate for Brisbane.


[20-Feb-20 09:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
:Labor: **Explosivo2002:** New Labor Candidate.


[20-Feb-20 09:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
:libref: **Plupsnup:** Former MP for Moncrieff and Libref Leader.


[20-Feb-20 09:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
.


[20-Feb-20 09:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Now, our predictions for the first preferences are:


[20-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Matt Monti#4771
**1: The Hon. MattMonti AO :sdp: **
**2: My13InchDuck :National: **
**3: Explosivo2002 :Labor: **
**4: The Hon. Bloodychrome AC :liberal: **
**5: Plupsnup :libref: **


[20-Feb-20 09:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
That would give us two party preferred between:
**The Hon. MattMonti AO :sdp: ** and **My13InchDuck :National: **


[20-Feb-20 09:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
And based on that our prediction is 
**MAYO: SDP gain :sdp: **

So Matt, you recently defected from the Social Democratic Party and are seeking to form the Socialists again. What made you come to that decision?


[26-Feb-20 08:39 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Look I've served the SDP for a long time.


[26-Feb-20 08:40 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I was in the original SDP and even became the Deputy Leader to Youmaton before we rebranded to Labor, which I then lead.


[26-Feb-20 08:40 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I lead our party into the most recent election, and lead us to victory.


[26-Feb-20 08:40 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Under my leadership the SDP were a strong voice for progressive politics.


[26-Feb-20 08:41 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Unfortunately, since I stepped down as leader the SDP have been dragged further and further to the centre.

I think their bowing to the ALP has really dragged them to the centre.

[26-Feb-20 08:44 PM] NGSpy#8096
Do you feel that the ideas that the Prime Minister have said about 'accountability in the cabinet' is simply avoiding the statement you have talked about and is just a weak justification?


[26-Feb-20 08:45 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I don't think so. I think the Prime Minister and cabinet had the intentions of being a strong leftist government when they formed. You saw that for the brief time Dyljam was Deputy Prime Minister.


[26-Feb-20 08:45 PM] Matt Monti#4771
However,


[26-Feb-20 08:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Unfortunately the new Deputy Prime Minister has failed to provide that same leadership from the left, and has instead failed to show up to parliament most days, and given a pass to the Nationals when they go absolutely bonkers.


[26-Feb-20 08:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So personally, I think it's time the SDP end's their coalition with Labor and fight for the true values of the left.


[26-Feb-20 08:47 PM] NGSpy#8096
Thank you for answering those questions Matt.

Anyways, Griffo, there has also been some statments made by the MP for Nicholls showstealer regarding a potential NatSpill. Could you put some light into what those claims are and the truth of it all?


[26-Feb-20 08:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
The rumours of a National Party Room spill have been circulating since Jesus walker the earth and in a surprise move to the member for Nicholls, I have not called a spill. Why? Because I have confidence in my party leader and I know that as a united leadership team, the both of us with the rest of the executive; GHagrid, Pacman, Thomas and My13InchDuck we will fight a strong battle at the next election and hopefully win, with the assistance of our tremendous coalition partners in the Liberal Party.


[26-Feb-20 08:57 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Look Alan, I personally think Griffo is just waiting till I'm the Parliamentary Leader of the Left, so then we can both lead our respective sides of politics and fight like an old married couple.

So, our top story today actually concerns the Liberty Reform Party. They've recently released an edited form of their previous manifesto. So to present unbiased information, the new manifesto promotes "Nationalised-Land-Value-Rent", a death duty for any inheritance above $1 million Australian Dollars and reforming the Goods and Service Tax. Tell us first Plupsnup, what is this "Nationalised-Land-Value-Rent" and how does it differ from the previous Land Value Tax?

Wrong, we want to abolish the GST and the inheritance policy will apply to all income inheritance. The difference between the NLVR and a LVT is in name only because the sorry room had come to realise that the way in which both work produces no deadweight loss, same with a death duty, unlike all other taxes that do. Because of this, the party room thought it was best that the LVY and the death duty should not be considered taxes, but a different kind a revenue collections scheme

No I don't, rent in economic terms is anything that is unearned. Inheritance is unearned, so is the practice of someone making rent only because of the community around him. Taxes on the other hand are money earned by those who pay them, such as wages and profit

@Deleted User you have no idea of  what the neo-classical movement had done to the modern economic arena. Tax cuts aren't enough. We must turn back to the economic teachings of Marx and George who's policies we dicredited by "voodoo economics". You are apart of a movement that has ruined this world since the 1980s. Read any heterodox book such as "Kapital' and "Progress and Poverty", please

By using fancy words it doesn’t make you look any better. If you actually got your head out of the textbooks and into the real world, you would see how bad your policies really are the dangerous ramifications they would have on our economy.

But more than that, they think they have some sort of right to be considered a major political player in Australian Politics now, despite coming 4th in Mayo, and somewhere around 6th in Brisbane.

@Deleted User your final thoughts.


[26-Feb-20 09:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Australia, I’d like to thank channel 9 for letting me on tonight for such a crucial discussion regarding tax policy. In the eyes of many Australians, I am the most qualified person to manage our economy and guide us to success through fiscally responsible means and whilst some may dispute how popular I am in this regard, it is undeniable that I have a very important influence with regards to our economy and when I can point out that the policies of the LRP are inevitably bad and will result in the crumbling of society when the government cannot fund itself or invest in the people, and when the SDP can agree with me on such an issue; we know there is a problem that we must nip in the bud quickly. 

Plupsnup, being the karma sutra of politicians and not actually knowing where he sits on the political spectrum, is a dangerous man to have in politics and to manage the economy because he is unstable. I can easily identify that his policies are not sensible left wing and they’re not sensible right wing either; they’re quite clearly communist and I only have to point to nations such as China, Soviet Russia, North Korea and Cuba to prove how that ends up. I could continue delving into the criticisms of Plupsnup but we don’t have much time tonight, so I’ll finish off there. If you or any of your loved ones are concerned about the topics discussed tonight in terms of the economy, my office is always open to answer your questions and I loom forward to working with the government in opposition to see a strong Australian economy once again! 

Goodnight Australia!


[26-Feb-20 09:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Thank you Griffo. Matt, your final thoughts.


[26-Feb-20 09:54 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Matt: Well look, I think when both Griffo and I agree your policy is stupid, you might want to rethink it. The vast majority of people support either the Nationals/Liberal Coalition, or the SDP. Both of these voting blocks absolutely oppose this plan to abolish all taxes and introduce a Land Value Tax. With their 9.08% of the vote, now think they are the party of the people. and the party that has policies everyone supports. However, 90.92% of voters support someone other than the LRP.

I get the personal history there, but as someone who considers myself a good colleague with all three of these people, I don't like the idea that Showstealer is getting away with behavior that if coming from myself, or griffo, or DKR or anyone else with a perceived personality, would be at least a warning.

Riley is currently the leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives, and has introduced countless motions which never seem to be more than one page in actual different content. Maybe he thought there was a 1 page word limit? Who fucking knows.


[04-Mar-20 07:57 PM] NGSpy#8096
He has recently introduced a motion for a 'pledge of allegiance' which has been extremely controversial with everyone, with the Social Democratic Party the answer to 'who's the UDP again?', the Australian Labor Party: the reason why the SDP is the UDP and the recently made Socialist Party which may I reminded you crashed heavily when they were in government previously.

The party as a whole is right-wing and extremely conservative, as you could probably tell from those tweets, and their 69 no wait 75 point manifesto highlights that enormously, with awful things like not allowing people to burn the Australian flag, banning abortion in Australia except for cases of rape, incest and health + safety, and worst of all **actively advocating for the death penalty**.

[04-Mar-20 08:24 PM] NGSpy#8096
Lets first start with the Australian flag thing. It might seem minor, but burning a country usually indicates there is something extremely wrong with that country in the first place. You don't just put it on the barbie to keep the flames fuelled, you use it as an active symbol against the government, and the Australian government knows this by allowing freedom of demonstration, which the National Party wants to actively get rid of. Sounding familiar to Hong Kong?

[04-Mar-20 08:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
The abortion ban is not only should just be an offence to women everywhere in Australia, with the simple fact that the Nationals, which may I add is all male in parliament, thinks they know how to handle pregnancies better then the people who actually do them, which is fucking crazy! They also never responded to the Prime Minister NGSpy on the campaign trail, actively reminding them that abortion could be a key factor in reducing crime in the United States:

[04-Mar-20 08:29 PM] NGSpy#8096
The National Party also advocate for the death penalty, when the statistics and facts line up to show that the death penalty does not reduce crime **at all** and is simply more expensive than life imprisonment.

[04-Mar-20 08:31 PM] NGSpy#8096
So there we go: A Nationalist Party that has a puppet, inconsistent facts, barely knows how to write more than one page and is willing to risk people's lives and dampen then liberties for the sake of Nationalism. I warn you, that if you **are** voting for them next election, this is what you are voting for. That's our story for tonight, thank you so much for watching! This is Alan Ayckbourne with a Late Aussie Night with Alan Ayckbourne signing off!

And I am Lachlan O'Brien!


[15-Mar-20 09:20 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Hello Lachlan! Big news tonight.


[15-Mar-20 09:20 PM] inactive#6974
Indeed!


[15-Mar-20 09:22 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Firstly tonight former justice GeneralRommel has entered back into the political sphere over the last few days and he is coming for the Nationals MP for Sydney and Leader of the Opposition Riley. Big target to go for when you just came back from months of silence don't you think Lachlan?


[15-Mar-20 09:23 PM] inactive#6974
Absolutely. GeneralRommel must have seen that Sydney is in need of an independent candidate, and to go after the most senior member of the opposition is a big task!


[15-Mar-20 09:24 PM] inactive#6974
He has been quite active since he got back, making up for lost time, will be an interesting story to follow.


[15-Mar-20 09:24 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yes it will

Now, another eventful Question Time today!


[15-Mar-20 09:27 PM] inactive#6974
The member for Cowper, Griffo, was 94a'd for the

[15-Mar-20 09:28 PM] inactive#6974
8th consecutive time


[15-Mar-20 09:28 PM] inactive#6974
Bringing the count to 19


[15-Mar-20 09:29 PM] JAYDEN#5487
wow!


[15-Mar-20 09:29 PM] inactive#6974
After his co-leader told him to come back with some more respect a couple of weeks ago, it's surprising that Griffo hasn't changed his behaviour.


[15-Mar-20 09:30 PM] inactive#6974
Though, I think we can all agree that the standout from QT was BabyYodaVevo.


[15-Mar-20 09:30 PM] inactive#6974
She asked 4 questions about Triple J's Hottest 100 of the decade.


[15-Mar-20 09:31 PM] inactive#6974
Not something the parliament should be focusing on, wouldn't you agree Jayden?


[15-Mar-20 09:31 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I'm sure Jayden, the member for Robertson would agree, and so do I, Daniel Hill


[15-Mar-20 09:32 PM] inactive#6974
Oops, sorry, you look very similar!


[15-Mar-20 09:32 PM] JAYDEN#5487
But yes, the majority of Question time was taken up by the topic, something that's not as important as the current COVID19 or the budget. Although budget questions were not allowed under standing order 100(e).


[15-Mar-20 09:36 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Talking about Jayden though, some very silly questions were asked to him today in Question Time.


[15-Mar-20 09:36 PM] inactive#6974
Yes.


[15-Mar-20 09:37 PM] JAYDEN#5487

Quite some interesting remarks.


[15-Mar-20 09:38 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Just look at these questions! Wowee! I have had word from a reliable source that the member has since apologised to all Government members with a handwritten letter and free hugs


[15-Mar-20 09:38 PM] JAYDEN#5487
But still, a very weird question time.

But, I think it is time to move onto the big news, don't you think?


[15-Mar-20 09:41 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Of course no question time could be over without some Cowper Shenanigans, with the member giving a speech in the same format as the 1st Female Prime Minister's misogyny speech when asked about his opinion on Fascism and the UN, the UN beign something he has been very against.


[15-Mar-20 09:41 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yes Lachlan I think we shall.


[15-Mar-20 09:41 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Labor Leader Explosivo2002 has released a press statement in the last hour regarding a merge with the SDP, Lachlan has more.


[15-Mar-20 09:43 PM] inactive#6974
Uhhh yes!


[15-Mar-20 09:45 PM] inactive#6974
After advancedgaming12 resigned as Senator for Queensland, Explosivo2002 took his position, and became leader of the Labor Party. Talks then began between the Labor Party and the Social Democratic Party, with leaders discussing a merge.

[15-Mar-20 09:47 PM] inactive#6974
After votes in both parties with a overwhelming majority for a merge, terms started to be set down.


[15-Mar-20 09:47 PM] inactive#6974
From what I have heard some key terms in this merger are
-Changes to the SDP Constitution to allow for free expression of person ideas
-A position for Explosivo2002 on the SDP National Executive
- A change to SDP Constitution to add a part about protection or workers rights


[15-Mar-20 09:48 PM] inactive#6974
I'll hand it over to Daniel to continue!


[15-Mar-20 09:49 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Thank you Lachlan


[15-Mar-20 09:50 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Labor leader says "the Left needs to united against the Nationals, and as Abraham Lincoln once said ‘a house divided against itself cannot stand’: if we are to defeat the Nationals, we need to make sure the house of the Left is not divided."


[15-Mar-20 09:51 PM] JAYDEN#5487
He goes on to say "For the time being, all members of the Labor Party will remain in the party until the application that will be filed in the coming days is finalised. However, any party member who wishes to resign their membership and not join with the SDP are free to do so, as I waive all fees associated with cancellation between now and the end of the merger period. As for our position in government, I will remain in the parliament as the Senator for Queensland and, pending finalisation, inherent the former positions of my predecessor as per the current Coalition agreement."


[15-Mar-20 09:52 PM] JAYDEN#5487
In terms of the actual merger deal, the Labor Leader has agreed to unite the parties without any special treatments being afforded to the Labor Party. He has also spoken with the Prime Minister and representatives of the SDP over changes to the SDP constitution to ensure the right of members of this united party to express their own personal beliefs that may be carried over from the slight ideological difference between our two parties.


[15-Mar-20 09:52 PM] inactive#6974
Daniel, just one thing to add.


[15-Mar-20 09:53 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yes Lachlan


[15-Mar-20 09:53 PM] inactive#6974
To make sure there is stable, strong leadership, there has been an Agreement that Explosivo won't seek leadership until 2021 at earliest.


[15-Mar-20 09:53 PM] inactive#6974
Quite interesting.


[15-Mar-20 09:54 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Yes I have heard that too, that means that Jayden will remain as Deputy Leader and NGSpy as leader for the next 9 months unless contested by a current SDP member, very interesting indeed


[15-Mar-20 09:56 PM] inactive#6974
As a centre - left and a left wing party merge, could this provide a stronger, united left, one that will be able to stand up to parties like the Nationals?


[15-Mar-20 09:57 PM] inactive#6974
Well, it looks like there is something I have to do, somewhere other than here, so I'll leave you to finish it off Daniel!


[15-Mar-20 09:57 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Thank you Lachlan.


[15-Mar-20 09:58 PM] inactive#6974
*runs off, farting*


[15-Mar-20 09:58 PM] JAYDEN#5487
In terms as what you just said, I feel like it will create a united left, Labor being not that far off of the SDP's values, if the Socs merge with the SDP that could create trouble and division in the party.


[15-Mar-20 09:59 PM] JAYDEN#5487
As far as the Labor Press Release, Explosivo says "In the end, this is a decision that will strengthen, not destroy, the Labor values and ideas. We will be able to elect more people dedicated to the causes of the working class as a united party then divided, and this unity will allow those of us in Labor right now to win more elections, hold more offices, and fight for our ideas from stronger positions then if we remained as two separate parties"


[15-Mar-20 10:00 PM] JAYDEN#5487
An SDP spokesperson is yet to provide comment but we will soon see if a statement is released, something to watch out for over the next coming days.


[15-Mar-20 10:01 PM] JAYDEN#5487
And finally tonight, the Budget is in the House of Representatives currently, and the opposition have been quick to point out numbers, but the Prime Minister says that these numbers are inaccurate and you cannot use the italic numbers as references because of the special accounts. I think they need to get some glasses!


[15-Mar-20 10:02 PM] JAYDEN#5487
here is a meme that the channel 9 news team created (M: some aussim person, idk who)


[15-Mar-20 10:03 PM] JAYDEN#5487
The meme has been lost!


[15-Mar-20 10:03 PM] JAYDEN#5487
And finally tonight, a change.org petition has over 30,000 signatures for Parliament to move this bill:

[16-Mar-20 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
They've got 3 senate seats up for election, right? 1 SDP, 1 Labor, 1 Liberal. If they want government, they need to hold 2 senate seats. It becomes a lot more difficult for the SDP to win 2 out of 3 seats, because essentially what they would need is a hell of a swing.

{Reactions}

[16-Mar-20 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
If they lose the Senate, they're in trouble.

{Reactions}

[16-Mar-20 08:16 PM] NGSpy#8096
Yeah that is a good point BabyYodaVevo. The Senate is extremely tricky but vital for the left wing to keep a hold of to avoid double dissolutions.

Not as if there's any centrist party around to help them either.

Yeah. But only having one senator and and only about two votes meaning a majority in the Australian Labor Party would be a grave oversight to miss on their part.

[16-Mar-20 08:39 PM] Explosivo2002#5778
Well, in short, AusToWork is a program designed to help the unemployed get back into the workforce, by partly subsidising wages of new workers that companies hire from the unemployment registry

I have a mixed response to the budget, I welcome the targeted approach to COVID-19 but I do feel that it should be accompanied by macroeconomic tax relief to take the edge off for Australian families.  Also on the assertion that I am right-wing, I feel you may be surprised, I like to find common ground for the greater good

There are so many things that I would like done with the fund.

That is not to say that I am against renewables, they too will play a key part of our future energy makeup

Yes, it is interesting. I believe that the Government is taking a strong stance, and has displayed strong leadership throughout this crisis. My heart goes out to all people who have lost jobs, friends or family members during this crisis. This Government is doing all we can, and this is shown through our in-depth, carefully planned Budget Paper No.2.

[01-Apr-20 07:16 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Nationals Co-Leader Griffo and Moncrieff Candidate My13InchDuck received criticism for referring to the COVID-19 virus "The Chinese Virus". What do say to those who see this as racist and xenophobic.


[01-Apr-20 07:21 PM] Hagrid#3801
This issue is less important than the national crisis that we are facing.   It is true that the Coronavirus originated in China in a wet market.  Calling it the Chinese Virus is not objectively racist but I am not sure if it is the best way to describe the virus as it is now a global pandemic.  As shadow minister for health I believe our main attention and efforts should be directed to dealing with COVID-19

Yes Mr Triangle


[01-Apr-20 07:26 PM] TheTriangle#4346
Calling COVID-19, the Chinese Virus is racist. Unfortunately as we have seen around the world including Australia, there has been abuse towards Chinese members of our community, even if they weren't born there. Calling COVID-19 Chinese, is only associating this virus with a race, promoting hatred. A virus cannot have a race, a virus cannot have a nationality. So we must stop people who call it the "Chinese Virus" and correct them. Can Mr Hagrid please say if when he will see his party colleagues, he will tell them not to refer to COVID-19 as the Chinese Virus?

[01-Apr-20 07:29 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Mr Greggor, your response to this


[01-Apr-20 07:31 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Much of my sentiments are similar to those of my friend Triangle over there and I'd like to commend him for his standpoint.

I have had the privilege to defend the Asian-Australian community and communities of migrants all across this country. It is simply abhorrent that we have a party in our Parliament who would use language which appeals to racists and appeals to anti-Asian sentiments. It is a dogwhistle, nothing more and nothing less which is fuelling beatings of Asians on our streets and abuse. Just this week, I've had a concerned member of the Sydney community come to me and say they felt stigmatized for being Chinese. The National Party is fueling that type of rhetoric despite their pleas that they merely wish to label the country of origin. 

To think that the representative of the National Party would call the beatings of Chinese-Australians and the active threats being made to people's *lives* across the world because of this as a non-issue is tantamount to ignoring racism when it hits them in the face and ignoring the very real abuse that is being subjected to these communities. Most especially has the Leader of the National Party been guilty of that and there has been no attempt at an apology from him to our Asian-Australian communities who make up 10.8% of the very city he represents! Absolutely shameful!

The SDP have passed multiple bills aimed at ending discrimination towards LGBTQIA+ Australians, including the Blood Donation amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act.


[01-Apr-20 07:33 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Mr Hagrid, many have suggested the Nationals would repeal some of these LGTQIA+ protections. Do the Nationals have any plans to do so?


[01-Apr-20 07:37 PM] Hagrid#3801
We will absolutely repeal this legislation.  As shadow minister for health I opposed that legislation as it put the blood supply of Australia in danger.  The SDP characterise opposition to the legislation as transphobic but this is just not the case.  The bill reduces the blood donation supply, putting at risk the many Australians that require blood transfusions in their life.  Furthermore, the legislation is borderline unconstitutional as it falls out of the scope of exclusive or concurrent powers granted to the Commonwealth under the Constitution


[01-Apr-20 07:38 PM] Matt Monti#4771
What would you say to experts at the Red Cross who actually went further than the legislation mandated, lower deferral periods to 3 months?


[01-Apr-20 07:40 PM] Hagrid#3801
The Red Cross often has to act in extreme circumstances in situations of great instability.  But that is beside the point, what the issue is, is the legislation that was put before parliament and has since been enacted into law


[01-Apr-20 07:40 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Mr Greggor, would you support the Nationals plan to repeal this legislation?


[01-Apr-20 07:43 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I would not and I've outlined why in my opening speech to the people of Sydney. 

This again is an issue which I fear the National Party has used dogwhistling to achieve anti-LGBTQ+ sentiments and voters. While the representative of National likes to claim it put the blood supply at risk, there's little to no evidence to suggest that the blood supply was going to become instantly tainted with STI's like some of their rhetoric suggests. There is a process which allows for blood donations to be given and LGBTQ+ Australians should be perfectly entitled to their liberty to donate blood to help their fellow Australians. This is another issue where there is lives at stake and the National Party has chosen to ignore that completely. 

I trust the experts at the Red Cross and I trust the experts worldwide who say that this type of policy will help liberalize our blood donation laws and will help address the crucial supply issues we face in Australia.


[01-Apr-20 07:44 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Mr Triangle, your response?


[01-Apr-20 07:45 PM] TheTriangle#4346
No, I would not support Nationals' plan to repeal this legislation. We are a pro-LGBTQ+ Party, and I will fight for my right to donate blood.

Senator Slater, will the SDP be taking their Pro-LGBTQIA+ agenda further if given a second term in Government?


[01-Apr-20 07:48 PM] inactive#6974
Alex, we certainly will. We have a plan to develop a national LGBTQIA+ health plan to ensure that health standards for LGBTQIA+ members of the Australian community are met. We are also planning to replace the LGBTQIA+ specific amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act with a full Sexuality and Gender Diverse Discrimination Bill, an idea proposed by MattMonti and the Socialists.


[01-Apr-20 07:49 PM] inactive#6974
If I could respond to you Hagrid, you called it risky, yet countries around the world are doing this. England, Canada, France, all countires that have repealed the discriminatory law, in favour of a 3 or 4 month deferral period. England did it following recommendations from the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs. Can you really just throw away the science, as many of you party members do? The bill submitted by me, and written by the fabulous MattMonti was a bill of common sense. Australia is in desperate need of more blood. Many in the medical field have identified the need of an increase to blood supply, and this government is delivering.

[01-Apr-20 07:53 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Despite most of the worlds focus being on the COVID-19 Crisis, we are still facing the possibility of an uninhabitable planet for future generations. Mr Greggor, as an Independent what do you hope to bring to the Climate Change debate in Canberra?


[01-Apr-20 07:57 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Well Alex, I hope to bring a perspective born from the struggles I already see in communities of my birth nation of Fiji. 

As an Independent, I hope to bring the ideas and vision motivated by seeing the people of the island of Ono-i-Lau struggle as their traditional fishing lands are engulfed by the sea. I have seen the people of Kiribati struggle as their very homes are swallowed. I have been to the sugar cane farms of Vanua Levu and seen the tides come up slowly and slowly. 

When I first ran for Member of Parliament for Robertson, many of my relatives told me to take a definitive stand on climate action. They told me that they could not tolerate the rhetoric of those who think it's not man made or those who try and wave it off as a non-issue. It is real and it is swallowing my people and I've had enough. 

If the people of Sydney and the people of Australia want a voice which has seen and struggled through the *real* effects of the Climate crisis rather than those who claim to be experts, then they'd support me and support my viewpoints and vision for what Australia can do.

I thank Gregor for his concerns. This government, unlike the previous government, acknowledges the importance of climate action. We declared a climate emergency, we then dedicated 30 billion dollars to funding renewable infrastructure, to ensure a smooth transition to renewable energy. We also are providing a retraining program for coal workers to ensure they aren't left jobless, because the SDP care about Australia and we care about Australia's workers.

The co-leaders of the Nationals deny that humans have an impact on climate change. They continue to ignore the science. They are putting this country at risk. The SDP has one of the best climate policies of any party, if not the best.


[01-Apr-20 08:05 PM] inactive#6974
We will continue to commit to honouring the Paris Agreement, something that the Nationals want to pull out off.


[01-Apr-20 08:06 PM] inactive#6974
Investing in a renewable, carbon future for Australia might come at a cost, but I ask you, what is the cost of inaction?


[01-Apr-20 08:09 PM] inactive#6974
The cost of inaction is loss of land for pacific nations, the economic impacts on farmers as droughts intensify, the loss of life from bushfires, as we saw this summer. The bushfires were accelerated by climate change, and for the Nationals to deny this, is plainly wrong.

[01-Apr-20 08:11 PM] inactive#6974
( @TheTriangle )


[01-Apr-20 08:17 PM] TheTriangle#4346
This summer, Australia had its biggest ever bushfire season on record. Millions of animals died, thousands of people lost their homes, and dozens died. The Amazon, and California have also had larger fires than usually expected in the last couple years. This trend is not normal, it doesn't usually happen. Climate Change is causing this, the world is clearly warming. Why? Well it is simple, it isn't from natural occurrences, if that were the case, the warming would be way slower than it is now, the planet has never warmed this fast in history. So why is it warming? Simple, because humans are doing it, Carbon Dioxide and Methane Emissions are gases which trap heat into our atmosphere and in return warm are planet up. So we need to act, and reduce emissions.


[01-Apr-20 08:17 PM] inactive#6974

[01-Apr-20 08:23 PM] TheTriangle#4346
So what are the Greens doing to stop emissions. Firstly, we'll declare an emergency, not just for Australia, but call on the whole world to act. We will reach carbon neutrality by 2030. We will partially fund the purchase of electric cars, the working class cannot afford to buy cars which reduce emissions. We must help our poor in this fight, so they can afford a green future. The Greens will help invest in carbon capture technology, which will help reduce our Carbon Dioxide levels. However, it is certain now that we will face the consequences of climate change so we must prepare for them. We will build sea walls to stop our cities flooding. We will invest more in our fire services to reduce the impact of bushfires. We must fight an impending disaster, and we will end in chaos if a climate denying Nationals government is in power for just 1 term.


[01-Apr-20 08:24 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Right, we'll go to Mr Hagrid on this issue and then to final statements. Mr Hagrid?


[01-Apr-20 08:31 PM] Hagrid#3801
The Nationals are the party that represents Australia on the issue of climate change.  There are a broad array of opinions on climate change in this nation and there are a broad array in the National Party.  The SDP claims it is the best party to combat climate change, this is completely wrong.  The Nationals have plans to prepare Australia for the effects of climate change.  We have an emergency  fund for national disasters.  We will drought proof the interior of Australia beginning with the Bradfield scheme.  We will make the interior of Australia liveable to allow Australians to move away from the rising seas.  Renewables must form a part of our future energy grid, there is no dispute about this.  But the SDP will leave us with no baseload power as they have completely ruled out allowing nuclear energy to form part of our energy make up.  Only the Nationals support clean baseload power for Australia.  Only the Nationals will lead Australia into a future where we have hope against climate change


[01-Apr-20 08:32 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Alright we'll go to closing statements now starting with @Gregor The Beggar


[01-Apr-20 08:34 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
This election is an important one and there is a clear pattern in polling that the people want an SDP Government, a decision I deeply respect.

However, in a regional race for one of the most important cities in all of Australia, the people of the community have a clear choice. Do they side with a candidate who needed to be called out to even mention a word about Sydney on National TV during a panel or someone who has put Sydney first the entire time? 

This debate was about primarily social issues and I have made myself known as someone who stands different to Riley on these issues at every step. I come to these issues with experiences, with stories and with concerns. All of which I have either lived or been told by Sydney groups who have felt underrepresented by their current MP. We live in one of the most diverse and liberal cities in all of Australia and it is wrong they have been represented so poorly. 

I will take a stand to present my unique viewpoints on solving our economy and protecting our jobs to any Government I work with. I will take a stand to liberalize our migration laws and bring the untapped economic potential from them. I will take a stand for disabled caregivers who have to struggle being ignored. I will take a stand for LGBTQ+ Australians and their unique issues.

Above all, I will take a stand for Sydney and be motivated by the views which will bring us Forwards to the Future. Thank you

When I look at Australia, there are many problems. Obviously the COVID-19 pandemic, but also LGBTQ+ discrimination, poverty, racial division, and the effects of climate change. When I look again at what the parties are proposing as a solution, Nationals only want to increase the problem, Liberals won't comment on any problem, and the SDP are giving only small solutions. The Greens have a vision for change, implement a UBI, that'll solve poverty, teach LGBTQ+ education, that'll reduce discrimination, I could go on. Just look at our manifesto, it is filled with solutions. The Greens will give Australia the solutions it needs, not talk about the problems it's having. Vote Greens for real change that Australia needs!

Australia, we have had enough of the SDP, they are a party that doesn’t know how to govern for a nation.  They know how to govern for tiny sections of the population but that is not their task, they are a government and they haven’t acted like one.  Soon they will not even be able to say they are the best party for these tiny groups as we have the Green Party.  They will take the mantle of being the climate change and social justice party, where will this leave the SDP?
They have increased our taxes burdening us, with no structural spending reforms to point to as justifying these increases.  Australia hear me, for we are in crisis, the SDP will not reduce our taxes, providing desperately needed relief, the Nationals will!
The SDP will not reform our economy to make it work for all Australians, the Nationals will.
The Nationals will lead Australia into a bright future for all Australians!

Well Australia, we have seen strong governance this term. 12 bills were assented to, compared to only 4 last term, under the Liberals. There has been strong consistent leadership, action on climate change, and a passed budget, something that hadn't been done since the 11th parliament. Not one Government MP or Senator has been ejected. This term has been one of great success. This SDP Government has done so much, and will continue to act. More climate action, better transport, better education, improved healthcare. We have responded to the bushfires and have responded to COVID-19. This election you have 2 choices, you can risk the instability, the infighting, the lack of action from a Liberal-National Government, or you can continue to see the benefits of being under a SDP Government. We have a strong dedicated campaign team, and you have seen that, in the early days of this campaign. You have seen no performance from the Liberals at all. What does that say? Do they care for Australia, for Australians, because apparently not. We can't risk the chance of the Nationals being in government. They have policies that are not for all Australians. The SDP will fight for you, because we believe in anyone no matter who they are. The SDP will fight for workers rights, we will fight for LGBT Rights, we will fight for basic humans rights. Let's re-elect this government, to ensure we can continue providing for all Australians.

So Youma, as the long time serving member for Canberra, what do you feel is the most rewarding thing about being the federal member for Canberra?


[02-Apr-20 09:07 PM] Youmaton#1190
Easily the most rewarding thing about being the MP for Canberra is the feedback and support Ive recieved from the people of the ACT. It is with the support of one's electorate that an MP can best deliver for where they are elected to, and I am blessed to have so many people writing to me, telling their stories, and giving suggestions upon how we can improve Canberra and the nation.


[02-Apr-20 09:08 PM] NGSpy#8096
That's a really nice thing, and I can imagine that it must be rewarding to represent the people.

[02-Apr-20 09:19 PM] ARichTeaBiscuit#7865
I have been talking to people across Capricornia throughout this election and what they've been telling me is that they want a government to invest in our future, for example by committing to building the public housing that we so desperately need. I understand these concerns and if elected I will fight to ensure these needs are met.


[02-Apr-20 09:19 PM] NGSpy#8096

[02-Apr-20 09:25 PM] Hagrid#3801
My approach to dealing with the Coronavirus is a combination of what the government is implementing with the stimulus package alongside serious tax cuts to GST.  This combination would mitigate the inflationary aspects of the stimulus.  Australia needs to economy to be in a position where it can restart when it is safe to do so.


[02-Apr-20 09:26 PM] NGSpy#8096
That is an extremely interesting idea. @ARichTeaBiscuit what do you make of it?


[02-Apr-20 09:29 PM] ARichTeaBiscuit#7865
I think that the approach that we've seen from the government now in regards to COVID-19 is benefiting the people of my electorate right now, but what we need is something to kickstart the economy once this is over. If we invest in our infrastructure and our public services then we'll see jobs return to certain sectors of the economy and that will flow across multiple sectors, an example would be construction workers for a highspeed rail line visiting a local cafe and helping that business out. It is a positive chain reaction that we need to create and I plan to be part of that effort alongside the rest of my colleagues in the SDP


[02-Apr-20 09:30 PM] NGSpy#8096
Any thoughts on ARichTeaBiscuit's idea @Hagrid ?


[02-Apr-20 09:32 PM] Hagrid#3801
I absolutely agree that infrastructure spending is crucial to keep this nation running and unified.  I like the sound of the idea of moving certain affected workers around to the economy, where they are needed.


[02-Apr-20 09:33 PM] NGSpy#8096
Well at least we agree on something here ladies and gentlemen! Bi-partisanship still exists!


[02-Apr-20 09:33 PM] NGSpy#8096
Now, after the COVID-19 crisis is over, what do both of you plan to try and implement in parliament to benefit the Australian people? starting with @ARichTeaBiscuit .


[02-Apr-20 09:37 PM] ARichTeaBiscuit#7865
I have spoken before about the importance of improving Australia's transport infrastructure through the implementation of high-speed rail and appearing online streams has really led me to the importance of establishing highspeed internet but I think one of the things I am looking to implementing most is creating safe cycling and pedestrian infrastructure for our children, as I think we should all strive to ensure that they are kept as safe as possible while travelling to school.


[02-Apr-20 09:39 PM] NGSpy#8096
What does @Hagrid think about this?


[02-Apr-20 09:39 PM] NGSpy#8096
and does he have additional policies to bring to the table?


[02-Apr-20 09:44 PM] Hagrid#3801
The safety of children is of upmost importance.   I think policy should be made to encourage children to use public transport to get to school when available, reducing congestion on our roads.
 My goals are a reformation of the tax system that will promote employment and wage growth.  The GST is a bad tax for both workers and businesses, driving up prices of goods and services, making them harder to afford for consumers and harder to sell for businesses.


[02-Apr-20 09:46 PM] NGSpy#8096
Very interesting ideas which I look forward to researching and possibly talking about in my show.


[02-Apr-20 09:47 PM] NGSpy#8096
For both of you, what has been your favourite campaign event/poster that a candidate has used this election so far?

[02-Apr-20 09:49 PM] Hagrid#3801

[02-Apr-20 09:51 PM] ARichTeaBiscuit#7865
I am personally a big fan of Youma's taking of the political compass test. I liked the way that they worked through the questions, how they impacted the lives of everyday Australians and what the SDP would do to make things better.

Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to 9 News election, I am your host, Daniel Hill


[03-Apr-20 03:36 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Today the official candidate list for this upcoming election was announced by the AEC, with a shock change in seats from Incumbent Mayo MP BloodyChrome changing where he contests to his former superior, Youmaton


[03-Apr-20 03:37 PM] JAYDEN#5487

[03-Apr-20 03:37 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Please note, these are very early predictions, and no current polling, so this may radically change (just like Nats Senate Candidate #2 did) further along the election.


[03-Apr-20 03:38 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Firstly, we have the Seat of **PEARCE**

[03-Apr-20 03:40 PM] JAYDEN#5487
With the current PM NGSpy, going up no name National Kisakuwu, we predict a **PEARCE** will be a **SDP RETAIN** :sdp:


[03-Apr-20 03:40 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Next, onto **MAYO**


[03-Apr-20 03:43 PM] JAYDEN#5487
With former SDP Leader MattMonti going up against a Nationals no name Centipede77 after the incumbent MP has moved to Canberra, we again predict **MAYO** as an **SDP GAIN** :sdp:

Now onto **COWPER**


[03-Apr-20 03:45 PM] JAYDEN#5487
With the Deputy Leader of the Opposition sitting on a nice Margin, we believe the SDP candidate Darceman will not be able to fight him off, we predict **COWPER** a **NATIONALS RETAIN** :National:


[03-Apr-20 03:47 PM] JAYDEN#5487
**HOTHAM** is next


[03-Apr-20 03:48 PM] JAYDEN#5487
With the incumbent speaker facing off against National Candidate Draganik, we again think Mikiboss can hold him off, we predict **HOTHAM** a **SDP RETAIN** :sdp:

[03-Apr-20 04:15 PM] JAYDEN#5487
With Former PM and incumbent MP Youmaton in a head to head battle against former PM BloodyChrome with some national third wheeling, we think this seat will be very interesting. We are calling this seat **TOO CLOSE TO CALL** at this stage. We think the next polling will be very interesting, but we think Nat/Lib prefs will be very interesting

[07-Apr-20 05:00 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Hello and Welcome to Channel Nine's Election Coverage I'm Alex Monti, joining me tonight is Lachlan O'Brien


[07-Apr-20 05:01 PM] inactive#6974
Hello!


[07-Apr-20 05:01 PM] inactive#6974
Quite an exciting night tonight, isn't it Alex?


[07-Apr-20 05:02 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Indeed Lachlan and thank you for being here with me to cover what should be an unpredictable night.


[07-Apr-20 05:03 PM] Matt Monti#4771
This Campaign has come at a very interesting time in history with the COVID-19 crisis shaping this campaign into one like we've never seen before. Candidates swaped out rallies for livestreams, posters for online ads, and meet & greets for online Q&A's.


[07-Apr-20 05:04 PM] Matt Monti#4771
With the NGSpy government due to go back to the polls we've been forced to deal with not only the future of our country, but also the future of our planet and our species.


[07-Apr-20 05:06 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Alas like all elections this was full of surprises, like BloodyChrome moving to Canberra, The Nationals advertising on PornHub and much more.


[07-Apr-20 05:06 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Lachlan what are your thoughts on the campaign now that it's all over?


[07-Apr-20 05:09 PM] inactive#6974
Well, It's been quite interesting to watch how the candidates adapted to these social distancing restrictions. I heard that over 40 livestreams were held! This looks like it will be very close, and very few seats are safe. One thing that could be very interesting, is the crossbench. 4 Independent candidates are running, in Nicholls, Denison, Brisbane and Sydney, and all could be elected. The next government will definitely need the support of at least of these independents.


[07-Apr-20 05:10 PM] inactive#6974
At least 1 of these independents.


[07-Apr-20 05:12 PM] inactive#6974
Also, the results of the senate will be vital for the next government. It looks like the SDP are on track to take at least 2, and the coalition the other 2. If a 2-2 result happens, the senate will have 4 SDP, 4 Coalition, which will prove very difficult for the future government, and passing their landmark legislation, like a budget.


[07-Apr-20 05:13 PM] inactive#6974
We are certainly in for a night of surprises, I will say that.


[07-Apr-20 05:14 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Alright let's look at each of the seats tonight and make a projection where we can.


[07-Apr-20 05:16 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Let's start with Pearce (WA). Channel-Nine haven't been able to find any official polling from this electorate, but from our limited resources in the state we believe there will a dramatic swing towards the Prime Minister tonight which will Pearce go from Marginal SDP to Safe SDP.


[07-Apr-20 05:17 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Lachlan what do you think we could see out of Pearce tonight?


[07-Apr-20 05:19 PM] inactive#6974
I concur with your analysis there. The Prime Minister has put in a strong campaign, and I believe, with the amount of effort he has put into this term, he should easily retain.


[07-Apr-20 05:22 PM] inactive#6974
Last election, the Liberals and Nationals both ran candidates, and tried to take Pearce on preferences, but that hasn't occurred, as the Liberals have only run in 3 electorates and the senate, which should further increase the SDP vote in Pearce.


[07-Apr-20 05:22 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Let's move on to South Australia and the seat of Mayo!!


[07-Apr-20 05:25 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So in a rather interesting turn of events the sitting MP, BloodyChrome of the Liberal Party, has decided not to re-contest this seat, opting to move to Canberra and challenge sitting MP Youmaton. This has seen the traditionally marginal seat swing dramatically to the SDP according to all Channel-Nine Polling. We predict this seat will be the first flip of the night, and dramatic one at that, with former MP MattMonti sitting comfy on a slightly smaller margin than the Prime Minister in Pearce.


[07-Apr-20 05:26 PM] inactive#6974
Thank you for that.

Onto Lingiari, in the Northern Territory.


[07-Apr-20 05:33 PM] inactive#6974
Now, the sitting SDP MP, Caeslius, decided not to re-contest. 2 newcomers to politics, Nationals Member CardboardGradient, and SDP Member Copelonian. The campaign has been interesting to follow. The last poll had the Nationals on 52.5% and the SDP on 47.5%, but with the margin of error being 8%, this seat is definitely one to watch. I don't think I am ready to call this one.


[07-Apr-20 05:33 PM] inactive#6974
Your thoughts Alex?


[07-Apr-20 05:34 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I agree Lachlan, late polling broke for the Nationals and I think if I were to call it I'd give it to the Nationals, but you're right, without any results I'm not ready to make a call for this one either.


[07-Apr-20 05:43 PM] inactive#6974
Well, let's move up to Queensland, looking at Capricornia, now this is a seat that, in all honesty, I didn't expect to be at risk, but the Liberal Leader, Former Deputy Prime Minister, TheAudibleAsh didn't kick of his campaign until Saturday, if I recall correctly. The SDP candidate has campaigned very well, and the latest poll had them at nearly 49.3%, which looks good for the SDP. It would be a major upset and achievement to unseat Ash here, and I would say that this seat is leaning to likely SDP, but again, if that primary vote drops below around 46%, there could be a chance for the Libs.


[07-Apr-20 05:43 PM] inactive#6974
Again, another seat that is a little uncertain.


[07-Apr-20 05:43 PM] inactive#6974
Alex, would you agree?


[07-Apr-20 05:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Yes I would Lachlan. for Ash to have a chance at retaining this seat he needs ARichTeaBiscuit to drop to 45% primary. Anything about 47% is getting into unbeatable territory for the SDP. I wouldn't call this just yet either, but it looks like it may be the second SDP pick up of the night.


[07-Apr-20 05:46 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Let's move on to Moncrieff.

*leaves*


[07-Apr-20 05:49 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So this is probably one of the most interesting seat this election. Early polling had a close race, with the Nationals candidate, My13InchDuck sitting just above 50%, the SDP candidate Zhukov sitting on 39% and the OWOTriangle sitting on 10%. Later polling showed the Nationals pulling away with 56% of the primary vote. I'm not prepared to declare this yet, but it's looking more and more like a Nationals Gain. For the Greens to take this seat they need to get the Nationals under 45% and hope the SDP votes flow to them.

[07-Apr-20 05:55 PM] Matt Monti#4771
What do you expect to see from Moncrieff tonight?


[07-Apr-20 05:58 PM] JAYDEN#5487
I think Moncrieff will be a very interesting race, with the SDP Candidate not being very active this campaign, I would expect more voters to be aware of the right leaning parties. The green party is a very interesting twist to this election, and will be very interesting to see how voters react. I would be more inclined to see this as a Liberal or National gain at this point.


[07-Apr-20 06:01 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Alright let's move on to Brisbane.


[07-Apr-20 06:04 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Brisbane is a tight contest between Independent and Former MP for Moncrieff Zak, and SDP newcomer Wanuke. From all polling this seat is a toss up. Zak was the favourite early but recent polling has seen the seat as close as 50-50. This seat could go either way so I'm not ready to call this yet. Daniel what do you think?


[07-Apr-20 06:05 PM] JAYDEN#5487

TAX CUTS!!! TAX CUTS!! BABY TAX CUTS!!! What more needs to be said. Long serving MP Griffo isn't going anywhere as the Nationals hold this seat on an increased margin. I'm calling this as a Safe Nationals Hold.

Next we look at Robertson. SDP Deputy Leader, Jayden Williamson is in a close race with Nationals Candidate Winston Wilhelmus. However late in the campaign Mr Wilhelmus held several event that completely ignored COVID-19 social distancing rules and requirements. Most recent polling shows Jayden pulling away with this one. We are ready to call Robertson as an SDP Hold.


[07-Apr-20 06:12 PM] JAYDEN#5487
Jayden Williamson is a true blue aussie guy who wants the best for the people, I see this as a good win for his constituency

[07-Apr-20 06:15 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Indeed. Next is the seat of Cunningham, one of the more interesting races this election. Former Liberal Senator Stranger has resigned from their position and contested this Southern NSW seat. Current incumbent MP Rhaums is in a serious fight for her life tonight and we could see our first SDP loss in this marginal seat. We aren't ready to call this yet but it looks like we may see a gain for the Liberals.

Hello Australia, I am back! Apologies for the *disruptions* caused by Daniel


[07-Apr-20 06:21 PM] inactive#6974
I think it was surprising that a sitting senator would resign to run in Cunningham, but it may pay off. The campaign has been very close, and the last poll had 
Rhaums (SDP): 38.6%
Infinitex9 (NAT): 26%
Stranger195 (LIB): 35.4%


[07-Apr-20 06:23 PM] inactive#6974
This looks extremely worrying for the incumbent. National preferences would flow to the Libs, electing the former senator.


[07-Apr-20 06:24 PM] inactive#6974
Again, I agree, not ready to call this yet, but I would say this leans Liberal.


[07-Apr-20 06:26 PM] inactive#6974
Now, moving onto Sydney!


[07-Apr-20 06:31 PM] inactive#6974
Nationals Leader and Leader of the Opposition, Riley8583 is facing a fierce challenge from the Fijian-born independent, and former MP for Robertson, Gregor the Beggar.


[07-Apr-20 06:34 PM] inactive#6974
Surprisingly, there hasn't been a poll here, so there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding this, but I think the Nationals should be ahead here.


[07-Apr-20 06:35 PM] inactive#6974
That being said, anything can happen, and an upset could be on the cards.


[07-Apr-20 06:37 PM] inactive#6974
Moving onto Victoria.


[07-Apr-20 06:37 PM] inactive#6974
First up, we have Nicholls.


[07-Apr-20 06:39 PM] inactive#6974
Independent incumbent showstealer1829 has run a strong campaign, and the SDP candidate, lily-irl has not been seen. This will be an easy retain for the independent.


[07-Apr-20 06:39 PM] inactive#6974
Next up, Hotham!


[07-Apr-20 06:42 PM] inactive#6974
SDP Incumbent and Speaker, Mikiboss, has lead a strong campaign, and the National candidate didn't campaign once, so this should be an SDP Hold.


[07-Apr-20 06:43 PM] inactive#6974
Now, the one toss-up in Victoria, Melbourne.


[07-Apr-20 06:47 PM] inactive#6974
GHagrid is in a close race with Trade Union Leader, and twice independent candidate for Cowper, MerrilyPutrid. Merrily has lead quite an extraordinary campaign, with some intriguing events. The latest poll had GHagrid with on 52%, but well within the margin of error. This will be a really vital seat for the Nationals to hold, and a major gain, if the SDP can manage to pull this off.


[07-Apr-20 06:47 PM] inactive#6974
Alex, your thoughts?

I think we're looking at a lot of close results tonight. We've got enough to hedge our bets one way or the other, but it's close enough that we could see some serious upsets.


[07-Apr-20 06:49 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Let's move on to the Senate now.


[07-Apr-20 06:49 PM] Matt Monti#4771
We've got 4 seats up for grabs this election in the senate.


[07-Apr-20 06:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Let's look at the state of the race before the election
1. [TAS] Later_Slater (SDP)
2. [QLD] Explosivo (SDP)
3. [WA] Comander_Cody2002 (LIB)
4. [ACT] VACANT (New Seat)


[07-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
From our projections we declare the following:


[07-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
1. SDP
2. NAT
3. SDP
4. Tossup


[07-Apr-20 06:51 PM] inactive#6974

[07-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Let's finish up our pre-results analysis with Denison.


[07-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Denison is a tight contest with former MP Dyljam running as an Independent against SDP candidate BHjr132


[07-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Matt Monti#4771
From all polls this is a 50-50 split with the SDP having their nose in front according to Nine News polls.


[07-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Matt Monti#4771
It's impossible to know how this seat will end up tonight so Nine will not be making a projection until we have results from the AEC.


[07-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Lachlan, your thoughts?


[07-Apr-20 07:02 PM] inactive#6974
Yes, interesting to see such a close poll there, and a good campaign from both candidates.


[07-Apr-20 07:03 PM] inactive#6974
Dyljam recontesting once again, but BHjr has run a strong campaign, and I agree, no projection here.


[07-Apr-20 07:05 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Alright now that brings our pre-results analysis to a conclusion.


[07-Apr-20 07:06 PM] inactive#6974

Thank you for having me, I love election nights, the excitement of the night never gets old


[07-Apr-20 07:10 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Now you've seen a few elections in your career and I know you've always been one to enjoy a good election night party. But tonight is the first election night where candidates haven't been able to gather with their supporters and family to watch results come in, how different does it feel to be in your office tonight rather than at an election night party?


[07-Apr-20 07:11 PM] Hagrid#3801
The atmosphere is completely different this time around,  Although the television coverage is just as engaging it is true that I won't be able to have a great party when I win


[07-Apr-20 07:12 PM] Matt Monti#4771
So from that answer I gather you're pretty confident about your chance of winning reelection tonight?


[07-Apr-20 07:13 PM] Hagrid#3801
I'm pretty confident, Melbourne and I have a special relationship.  All though feedback is different in this COVID era, the online feedback that i have received is very positive


[07-Apr-20 07:15 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Now tonight Melbourne is looking like it'll be a close race, do you see the Nationals having a path to Government tonight, if so where is that path in your opinion?


[07-Apr-20 07:18 PM] Hagrid#3801
The Nationals absolutely have a path to government tonight.  We have to have a strong showing in a number of seats.  Seats like Cunningham, Robertson and Lingiari are must wins for us.  We also have to provide a strong defence in the seats that we won at the last election.  While Griffo looks like he is safe in Cowper, Melbourne and Sydney look closer

[07-Apr-20 07:34 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Indeed, we can't really trust that count at the moment so we may have to come back to that.


[07-Apr-20 07:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Apparently this is only from an SDP friendly booth so we still have confidence this will be a Nationals Hold.


[07-Apr-20 07:36 PM] NGSpy#8096
Yeah that seems a bit fishy.

I’m very pleased with how the Nationals are doing in Moncreiff, this is excellent


[07-Apr-20 07:36 PM] NGSpy#8096
I'll call it Nationals hold as well.


[07-Apr-20 07:36 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Getting Results from Moncrieff now and the Nationals are above 50%


[07-Apr-20 07:36 PM] inactive#6974
I concur, the Nationals should take this.

Looks like the Liberals are doing well in two party preferred in Moncrieff.

3.1% swing towards the Nationals in Moncrieff.

On a more serious note though, if the Nationals are in opposition after the end of this election, will you ask Riley to step aside?

The early results are looking pretty good for you out of Sydney, how're you feeling right now and what do expect for the rest of the night?


[07-Apr-20 07:49 PM] NGSpy#8096
The results in Cunningham are looking extremely interesting.


[07-Apr-20 07:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm feeling really good. Sydney is an incredibly liberal city and they've shown a trend of supporting a liberal democratic candidate for their new MP. While Riley senses good energy on the ground, I've been to the streets and spoken to the grassroots workers of Sydney and their confidence is being shown


[07-Apr-20 07:49 PM] inactive#6974
Sorry to interrupt, but votes coming in from Hotham.

[07-Apr-20 07:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I hope that Sydney will ultimately elect me obviously but I'm seeing an overall trend tonight of swings towards both ways


[07-Apr-20 07:50 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Now it is a possibility that whoever forms government will rest on your shoulders, Gregor, will you give C&S to any possible government?


[07-Apr-20 07:51 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Right now, I've already gotten offers from both sides right now. I'd be more than happy to enter confidence with any side which let's me achieve the objectives the people of Sydney deserve. That could be a National Government or a SDP Government but above all I'm putting Sydney first in any arrangement I enter


[07-Apr-20 07:51 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I've already made it a precusor to expand high speed rail in Sydney and to liberalize Immigration laws in many areas for my support


[07-Apr-20 07:52 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Furthermore, there's a lot of promises I've gotten surrounding other issues which really do matter to the people of Sydney


[07-Apr-20 07:52 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
When I came home today, I got a lot of grassroots cheers and supports

[08-Apr-20 06:58 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Bruce: Yeah BT great to be with you tonight and you're right it's a ripper of a night for footy, the ground looks spectacular, but sadly, due to COVID-19 complications we have no crowd tonight and it does feel a bit empty.


[08-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Matt Monti#4771
BT: Yes it does Bruce and we have been told by the AFL that they will be letting fans back into the grounds as soon as they can, but until then they would still like play games and give the fans something to cheer about.


[08-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Bruce: Well let's look at tonight's match-up BT and it looks like it'll be a cracker, with the Sydney Giants, taking on the Port Adelaide Magpies.


[08-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Sydney, looking to start their season with a nice win at home here in Sydney, while the Magpies are looking to steal a win on the road and get their season off to the perfect start. It should a be close game, and it's truly anyone's game to win.

**BREAKING NEWS:**


[09-Apr-20 03:39 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Good Afternoon I'm Alex Monti.


[09-Apr-20 03:40 PM] Matt Monti#4771
We are getting reports that SDP MP for Mayo MattMonti was just approached by the Daily Boomerang after someone leaked a private conversation between himself and three other SDP members.


[09-Apr-20 03:40 PM] Matt Monti#4771
According to a source familiar with the conversation Mr Monti suggested that SDP Leader NGSpy would likely need to resign after the election loss, which Mr Monti has said he believed at the time, but now no longer supports.


[09-Apr-20 03:41 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The leaker suggested Mr Monti wanted to VONC SDP Leader NGSpy however Mr Monti denies this and says the leaker in question is trying to smear him and remove him from the party.


[09-Apr-20 03:41 PM] Matt Monti#4771
This is showing some serious snipping and undermining within the SDP after they lost the election.


[09-Apr-20 03:43 PM] Matt Monti#4771
That's all from NineNews we'll be back with updates later tonight.

[09-Apr-20 05:26 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Of course, this energy isn't matched like we always have it matched in a normal season is it?


[09-Apr-20 05:26 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
No the few members of the public or those who were allowed into the stadium tonight cannot match the energy of a full stadium of supporters.


[09-Apr-20 05:26 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But we do trust that every single fan of Rugby and the game is tuning in at home


[09-Apr-20 05:27 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
To join us here tonight we have Mitch Haylee and Hone Luapeli to discuss this game before the teams come out


[09-Apr-20 05:31 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
M: Hi yes, I'm Mitch Haylee and already this is an exciting match for us all isn't it?


[09-Apr-20 05:31 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
This match is going to set a clear opener in the Australian Conference and the results of tonight could easily start an early swing to either side


[09-Apr-20 05:33 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
H: That's correct Mitch, I've seen the Adelaide Rams play since I was a kid and if they can carry similar energy to how they normally operate on the regional level, I can see this as a clear sweep for the Adelaide Rams if they maintain that energy and maintain the very strong backline which they commonly hold.


[09-Apr-20 05:34 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
M: Hmm, I'm not so certain. Lot of rumors about a really good Newcastle forward pack with giants like Fred Hurley posing a clear threat to the Adelaide Rams. Some of the practice games have shown Newcastle players plow through two or three players before they're brought down. Let's see if they can maintain that


[09-Apr-20 05:37 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
H: Oh, it seems the players are heading onto the pitch now


[09-Apr-20 05:37 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Newcastle Knights are coming out first and on a normal night, we'd expect the crowd to be going completely ballistic in support


[09-Apr-20 05:37 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But I'm certain that houses all across Newcastle are very excited for tonight


[09-Apr-20 05:39 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and now we have the Adelaide Rams coming out to face them


[09-Apr-20 05:40 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Good, fit looking players all of them right now


[09-Apr-20 05:40 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Their Captain is apparently exciting a lot of passion from management and coaching teams


[09-Apr-20 05:41 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Both teams are lining up now and waiting for the first whistle to blow

[09-Apr-20 05:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So Hone, do you think that Newcastle are trying to keep this equal so they can get their good forward pack forwards to support a last minute try?


[09-Apr-20 05:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Well Mitch, I'd imagine that Newcastle would try and cause try's throughout and they squandered a good opportunity there


[09-Apr-20 05:49 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Look at the Rams players, all of them were out of position to that right hand side


[09-Apr-20 05:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
If they passed it up there they could have made a clear run up there


[09-Apr-20 05:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
While this is an equililzer, this seems like a misplay from Newcastle to me


[09-Apr-20 05:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
M: Well Hone you always were one to go for Gold

Scores are 3-6 to Newcastle Knights!


[09-Apr-20 06:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
H: This is odd you know, Newcastle is placing a lot of risk on these drop kicks


[09-Apr-20 06:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
They have a line built for scoring tries and pushing that over, this is a very odd strategy for them to play


[09-Apr-20 06:09 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
M: Well Hone, perhaps an early lead is something they're trying to get to demoralize the Rams early and build that lead forward?

And they have it


[09-Apr-20 06:53 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

*rerun shows the Rams player getting absolutely bodied, a tooth is seen flying out*


[09-Apr-20 06:59 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

H: Yeah, that one came down to the wire


[09-Apr-20 07:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
There must be thousands of disappointed Newcastle fans tonight


[09-Apr-20 07:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and Fred Hurley must be going home with the regret of a one point difference


[09-Apr-20 07:06 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
M: Aye, I agree

*cuts to the coach*


[09-Apr-20 07:07 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The coach for the Knights is looking absolutely shattered


[09-Apr-20 07:07 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
At the McDonald Jones Stadium, the game ends with Rams 14, Knights 13


[09-Apr-20 07:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
@Matt Monti We have the Manager of the Adelaide Rams here tonight to talk about the game


[09-Apr-20 07:08 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
So, how did you see your game's performance tonight and what do you think boosted them over the line?


[09-Apr-20 07:10 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I think the culture of our club really got the boys over the line tonight. Full credit to Newcastle they pushed us real hard in the first half, but I think the comradery of the team really pulled us together at half time, and we were able to put up a good fight to get over the line.


[09-Apr-20 07:10 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Do you think that your team will continue to perform throughout the season?


[09-Apr-20 07:13 PM] Matt Monti#4771
I think so. We obviously walked out a little underdone, and seemed to lack the skills we needed, but that second half was a demonstration of what we're capable of and if we can put that in week after week, we're looking at a good season.


[09-Apr-20 07:13 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Thank you, that was the Manager of the Adelaide Rams tonight


[09-Apr-20 07:13 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Thanks mate.


[09-Apr-20 07:13 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We must sign off now for the AFL being hosted on Channel Nine


[09-Apr-20 07:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But our next match is between the Taumata Big Knees and the Labasa Cane Cutters on Saturday Night, same time.


[09-Apr-20 07:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

**FRIDAY NIGHT FOOTY ON NINE**


[10-Apr-20 07:31 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Welcome to Friday Night football here from the beautiful MCG! The home of football and we've got a ripper of a game coming tonight, between the Western Bulldogs and Norwood!


[10-Apr-20 07:33 PM] Matt Monti#4771
And Norwood make their way onto the ground for the first time as an AFL side!


[10-Apr-20 07:34 PM] Matt Monti#4771
They're excited to bring their historic club into a new age. They've seen great success in the SANFL, with the second most premierships behind Port Adelaide, and now they're looking to add some AFL success to their club!


[10-Apr-20 07:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
The Western Bulldogs now making their way onto the ground and they're looking to stamp their dominance early in this season. A team that's been in the AFL for a long time now, this club knows how to succeed and they're hoping that experience will lead to some success this season.


[10-Apr-20 07:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Alright and the teams line up for the first bounce.


[10-Apr-20 07:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
*Whistle blows to start the first quarter*

After one round Brisbane are sitting on top followed by Essendon, Western Bulldogs, Morwell, Sturt, Darwin, Perth and Williamstown in the top 8, and as you can see Hawthorn are looking down the barrel of the wooden spoon early in the season.

**AFL RECAP WEEK 5:**


[12-May-20 11:05 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Good Morning and welcome to the AFL Recap for Week 5 of the Season and it was truly a spectacular round with come real thrillers and a few upsets.


[12-May-20 11:05 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Let's take a look at the round as a whole:

[12-May-20 11:05 AM] Matt Monti#4771
We started with a nice win for the Giants against Norwood who continue to struggle in early in the season.


[12-May-20 11:07 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Next was a disappointing game for Sandringham. After leading in a tight game for 3 quarters against the heavily favored Demons it looked like the Zebras could bring home their first win in a major upset. However, a late surge by the Demons brought them home by a comfortable margin, leaving Sandringham still winless on the bottom of the ladder.


[12-May-20 11:09 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Next was the biggest surprise of the round, Strong Premiership contenders the Tasmanian Devils were completely blown out of the water by Port Adelaide in their first game of the season at their second home ground, Alberton Oval. The Devils fought back in the third quarter by the Magpies ran away with things putting up their highest score of the season thus far, and the third highest score of any team this season, only being outdone by Townsville and Essendon.


[12-May-20 11:11 AM] Matt Monti#4771
After that we saw the Kangaroos continue a nice patch of play, winning their 4th game of the season and third in a row in their visit to the Gold Coast. The Gorgons continue their inconsistent play sitting 3 and 2.


[12-May-20 11:11 AM] Matt Monti#4771
We then saw the Central Coast Raptors continue their resurgence with a nice win against the Western Bulldogs on the road.


[12-May-20 11:13 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Next came the best game of the round, in my opinion as a Sturt fan, with the Double Blues lighting up the Adelaide Oval in an absolute domination of the Flacons. Beating Port Adelaide's score earlier in the day and putting up the 2nd highest score behind Townsville's 132 point against Darwin in Round 4.


[12-May-20 11:15 AM] Matt Monti#4771
We then went to Subiaco oval where the Lions took home the win in a close one against St Kilda. It look like a safe win for Subiaco early, going into half time leading the Saints by 30 points, but a much better second half brought the margin down to 5 points in the middle of the fourth quarter. But the Lions came storming home to take the win by 16 points.


[12-May-20 11:16 AM] Matt Monti#4771
Next came a battle of the felines as the Cats took on the Tiger. Not much a contest though in actuality as Geelong made a statement putting at 108 points and holding the Tigers to 55.


[12-May-20 11:18 AM] Matt Monti#4771
After that we went to the MCG for the actual best game of the round. The undefeated Essendon Bombers were going into the game favorites, and for good reason, however no one was ready to count a gutsy Brisbane Side and in the end it took some serious guts to keep up with the bombers.

[12-May-20 11:18 AM] Matt Monti#4771
But they did for the first three quarters, with scores level at three quarter time. The first half of the final quarter belonged to Bombers, who kicked the first 3 goals and looked like they were home.


[12-May-20 11:19 AM] Matt Monti#4771
But a late storm of goals by Brisbane meant the Bombers were left with a 7 point lead with 1 minute left in the quarter.


[12-May-20 11:20 AM] Matt Monti#4771
After Brisbane small forward Charlie Cameron soccered a goal in with 31 seconds on the clock, it was do or die for Brisbane. They need a clean centre clearance, a mark, and a goal.

Well miracle do happen in footy and this was one of them.


[12-May-20 11:21 AM] Matt Monti#4771
A slip from Essendon Ruckman Tom Bellchambers as he went for his jump put him out of position allowing an easy tap for Brisbane's Mitch Robinson.


[12-May-20 11:22 AM] Matt Monti#4771
The talented Brisbane Midfield worked the ball towards half forward with 12 seconds left. A kick inside 50 was Brisbane's last gasp.


[12-May-20 11:23 AM] Matt Monti#4771
But their prayers were answer when Lincoln McCarthy took a strong grab in the marking contest only seconds before the siren sounded.


[12-May-20 11:24 AM] Matt Monti#4771
To a chorus of boos from Essendon fans across the Country watching from home, McCarthy slotted the last goal to give Brisbane a 5 point win and break the Essendon winning streak.


[12-May-20 11:25 AM] Matt Monti#4771
The round ended with a series of hard fought wins for the away teams, as Darwin, Fremantle and Hawthorn all brought home the 'W' on the road against quality opposition.


[12-May-20 11:25 AM] Matt Monti#4771
After a brilliant round of footy the ladder looks a little different...

Despite the loss Essendon still sit top of the table, with Morwell, Fremantle and Sydney rounding out the Top 4. Darwin, Port Adelaide, Sturt and Gold Coast sit just inside the top 8, with Sandringham remaining at the bottom.


[12-May-20 11:27 AM] Matt Monti#4771

*unmutes mic* It's so great to be a candidate in the first post-COVID by-election in Australia! It's become a matter of national interest, which I find wonderful. Like many of you, I spend a great deal of my time thinking about our collective future. And the immutable truth which I always find myself returning to is this: our collective future lies in our individual futures. We begin our pursuit of greatness with our individual selves, extending our reach into our families, then our communities, and for the more ambitious of us, the nation. Melbourne is a community of communities, bustling with talent and teeming with potential. I want to see that Melbourne reaches that potential, and I will do that by helping Melburnians help themselves. Through good, meaningful representation we can strengthen our individual liberties, our family structures, and our community wellness. We can strengthen our local economies, improve our urban planning, and act for our environment. Our future generations depend on us, so let’s make the right choice this by-election.


[28-May-20 04:35 PM] inactive#6974
Deladi0?


[28-May-20 04:39 PM] delad#7470
Well it's great to be campaigning and running for beautiful Melbourne even with the challenging circumstances to campaign in due to the COVID-19 situation. Like my fellow candidate has said this by-election is important especially with the recent VONC attempt and slender balance in parliament. Local communities need help and quite simply it isn't on offer with the 2 major parties both focused on virtue signalling and parliamentary battles irrelevant to the needs of the people. So I'm here as something different as someone who promises to and will better represent Melbourne. I have the experience needed to immediately help craft evidence based policies in parliament. And together we can all benefit and become stronger than before.

_unmutes microphone_

It is my pleasure and honour to run for one of the most important elections in the country right now, as both Urquart and Deladi0 have stated in the current COVID-19 pandemic and it is something we really need to think over. Melbourne is a city of acceptance, it accepts everybody irrespective of their orientation, whether they be a gay, lesbian, transgender or genderless, and irrespective of their ethncity, Melburnians accept all, they do not have the narrow minded vision, which a lot possess. Melbourne is a city of love and compassion. It is a community of communities, as the previous speaker said. It is a place where talent and opportunity meet and form the irresistable combination of success and how the Melburnians constantly were ranked in the past as the most liveable city. Today we have problems like homelessness and lack of clean fuel and COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it a rollar coaster of problems, which I believe can only be solved by one with a vision for the future in mind along with the demands of the present. Therefore, having someone who represents the Melburnian values and also someone who is pragmatic is important, and SDP has always fulfilled that criteria and therefore I think we need to make the right choice this by-election and that's the reason I have contested this time and I hope the vote from each Melburnian which will make or break our future, is casted for the right person.

@SirSentimental, if you would like to go first.


[28-May-20 04:49 PM] SirSentimental#7081
*unmutes mic*


[28-May-20 04:51 PM] SirSentimental#7081
It goes without saying that the economic future of Melbourne has been tossed in the air a bit due to COVID-19. We would like to focus on what has been lost due to the lockdown, and that is business growth, increasing productivity and supply in our local economies, and supporting small businesses and consumers through tax reductions. We need to get Melbourne productive again, freeing up our key industries to get their operations back on the road, creating lost jobs from the lockdown, all with the appropriate health and safety regulations. The LNP has a great track record with the economy, and we aren't going to let the pandemic stop that!


[28-May-20 04:53 PM] doctor#0002
Thank you. @delad, how would you bring about the economic recovery in Melbourne after COVID-19?


[28-May-20 04:57 PM] delad#7470
*unmutes mic*
The economic future of Melbourne, of Geelong, everywhere between em and quite frankly all of Australia is tied with the economic future and connections of the world. To go about an economic recovery we firstly need to eliminate the virus and help the rest of the world to as well. The faster and more we cooperate with the rest of the world the quicker we see trade flowing back into Melbourne ports, the faster we have tourists who are an important part of Melbourne's economy back the faster we recover. There can be no economic recovery until we have a health recovery mainly in Australia of course but beyond it as well. Of course like UrguartTarkin mentions we need better productivity will be essential as well and for that we need to liberalise trade even further and promote all the new ideas and innovations that have come out of this lockdown.
*mutes mic*


[28-May-20 04:58 PM] doctor#0002
Thank you. Finally to @Pav, what's your response?


[28-May-20 05:04 PM] Pav#1147
_unmutes microphone_

This pandemic has brought in a series of new terms into our vocabulary, whether be Social Distancing or Masks or Quarantine, it has certainly brought something to concern for each one of us, our Economic Future. Urquart is right in saying the economic future of our Melbourne is under threat with the situation developing. I believe we need a strong and concrete plan to ensure that our economy prospers and gets the boom it will require to strengthen growth and harness our potential and utlize it positively. In this regard, one of our Party Members and Senator Later_Slater1407 has introduced a Bill which if enacted will provide a mandatory paid leave to all workers, causal, migrant or other, if they are found to possess the disease, care for someone with the disease or are connected through physical means such as family. At this time and place, I need to remind that Melbourne is a place with a large number of workers and therefore our focus needs to be worker-oriented as well. The Social Democrats have promised legislation to roll out an ambitious AusToWork scheme which will help employees who are currently out of work due to this pandemic. We will also be rolling out incentives to boost funding to our infrastructure sector and also ensure that the problems that will affect the Melbourne economy post COVID-19 such as homelessness are also tackled. We will also work on ensuring that there exists more tourist related opportunities and support being given to revenue generating activites to ensure that Melbourne is back on its feet faster.

[28-May-20 05:09 PM] SirSentimental#7081
It certainly seems that all of the candidates understand the importance of the approach to economic recovery. No doubt, increasing trade safely and freely, and looking out for our workers is important. But I speak alone tonight in my support for small business, enterprise and economic growth! Why, for instance, did the SDP vote down temporary tax relief for businesses? Don't we want to enable them to re-invest their revenue, thus creating jobs and reducing unemployment?

So the Social Democratic Party aims for all round economic growth, by that I mean growth to every single individual who is facing the disaster of the pandemic. For example, we in the Social Democrats submitted the Australian Jobs (Major Projects) Amendment 2020 Bill which is currently on debate in the Parliament. This is a Bill that aims to boost development by redefining the concept of Major Projects to reflect on ensuring that projects of community importance could be expedited and the projects can resume work faster, we have also the extraordinary circumstances clause which allows Ministers to allow individual community benefitting projects. Now as to why we voted in negative for the taxation relief, is because at a time of pandemic, when we need money to fulfill our ambitious projects, we slash tax and stagnate the flow of money into corporations with larger margins of profit than small. Basically, they are not helping the smaller businesses, for which we definitely support help. The taxation cut is a highly disasterous plan being put at this critical moment in time which benefits only certain people and not every person, something which we in the Social Democrats aim for and there goes our justification. Actually, larger corporations typically do not do what the Liberals are dreaming, re-investing and that's why we say no to the cuts.

Now, to pose a question to the Liberal National Party on their specific reply to their economic growth statement. They say they want to free key industries from regulations and then further in their reply say they want to maintain appropriate health standards. Are they trying to imply that they are being hypocritical? Can they explain their stance? Thank you!

This is a fundamental truth: small businesses cannot exist with unnecessary red tape and high taxation. They have employees to support, they have to break even. Does the SDP candidate need to be reminded of how much small businesses have been harmed throughout this period? We are capable of differentiating between the unneeded and the needed, and COVID health and safety standards are needed at a time of crisis like this! But we can help our businesses through this still: the LNP has and will continue to help them keep their costs of production low, by removing fuel excise taxes, exempting them from penalty rates, and decreasing the company tax by 25%. The government is not the key to economic recovery, it is working, innovative and caring Australians!

So let me take some time and analyse the statement given by my counterpart from the Liberal National Party. They say, "Small Businesses cannot exist with unnecessary red tape and high taxation". Okay, I agree with the statement. But what is exactly defined as red tape. Are you telling me that I should stop regulating food businesses from health standards so they can sell unhealthy goods for lower rates and ensure people can buy it, are you meaning that I should sacrifice the safety of what I eat or what I am seeing because it is according to you red tape. It is like telling me, you can sell poison in a pharmacy shop, because it is ethical. The argument does not make sense, does it. Again, they further state and I quote _"We are capable of differentiating between the unneeded and the needed, and COVID health and safety standards are needed at a time of crisis like this!"_. I mean you say first, remove the regulations aka the red tape and now you are saying you know to differentiate. This is my point, why is your stance so so hypocritical. You are playing with the lives of our Australians, it is dangerous, that is why the Social Democrats voted out your irresponsible "innoative" policies and we will continue to ensure that dangerous policies like lowering quality and safety standards do not continue. 

But again, my counterpart keeps running away from the question, so let me highlight it once again, why is your party hypocritical on every stand it takes?

Well it appears that the issue of protecting small businesses has not gotten through to the Social Democrats. Of course they believe our position is hypocritical, because they see red tape *in general* as important! All I can say is that the LNP does know how to differentiate, to make decisions that benefit businesses, and that will procure our long term future. Trust in Australians, trust in yourselves!

Despite previously, both the Prime Minister and Treasurer denying human effect on climate change, they have changed their stance, and announce a emission reductions target, of 45% by 2040. To the LNP candidate, I ask, by what means will this goal be achieved?

[28-May-20 05:42 PM] SirSentimental#7081
The LNP government has made it clear that it will not bow down to the climate hysteria of the left, and for that I respect them. The reason why is because it leaves us clear-headed and with a clean vision of what we are dealing with! We need to balance the economy with the environment, by implementing sensible market-oriented policy that does not slow economic growth, but rather directs it towards a low-emissions future. We can see this for instance through the cap and trade emissions scheme, incentivising businesses to take the friendlier and cleaner production process. We also seek to invest in low-emission alternatives, support Australians with savannah management, energy efficiency, and the capture and storage of carbon and methane.

I begin by thanking the question being posed to the candidate from the Liberal Nationals, exposing their lack of knowledge on matters which will impact our future. So let me go and help the Liberal National Party with what all our students learn when they are in their sixth or seventh form or grade, however we wish to call it. Climate Change or what according to the Liberal National Party is called as a hysteria is the epidemic that awaits an impact date, and is basically the global rise in temperature and variation in climate to dangerous and unsafe levels. To put it across for the Liberals, it is basically the reason why our summers are hotter increasingly and we are seeing more of cyclones and natural disasters happening on this planet. So, Climate Change is a reality, I understand their inspiration from the President of the United States, but that man is not gonna help us if we face the brutal outleash of our Mother Earth, or Climate Change. None of their lovely measures have worked for it, and I can be bold in saying, they have promoted measures which seek to enable further damage to the Earth, like subsiding petroleum industry. When the Earth is saying and scientists are saying, find alternate sources, we in Australia have a Government which says let me decrease the tax and allow petroleum to be exported so I can make more money, and allow my children or grandchildren to die due to Climate Change. That is LNP policy, let us highlight it. Now, to ask the counterpart, it is proven that their policies do not work and the wonderful policies put by NGSpy and us previously is the sole reason why our Australia is not gone to the extreme effects of Climate Change. They repeatedly say we are balancing, and everyone knows it is either Climate Action or No Action. So let me ask my opponent, can they stop being hypocritical and make their stance clear. Action or no action.

[28-May-20 05:52 PM] doctor#0002
Thank you. @delad, how will you and the Australian Democrats work to curb the effects of climate change?


[28-May-20 06:01 PM] delad#7470
*unmutes*
Thanks I've had to find something else to do here while waiting. Firstly we have a cap and trade scheme currently passed through parliament which is the key step towards reducing demand for carbon intensive emissions and encouraging investment in both clean energy and in more energy efficient ways to power our homes and businesses. It is also essential to simply acknowledge the reality of climate change which it seems to have taken a long time for the LNP to do. So there's no need to wax lyrical about it's effects we know what'll happen with climate change that's not a debate. We need to remove subsidies for fossil fuels in Australia. Quite simply there's no need for the government to be funding climate change at the tax payers expense with the beneficiaries simply being big corporations. We have to redirect whatever subsidies we have towards instead subsidies renewable tech and infrastructure. We can be a world leader and we shouldn't hide away from that we should encourage it and invest in it. We can greatly speed up the transition to a renewable economy by building it ourselves with the government. The government should fund a scheme to place rooftop solar across all government buildings and schools nationwide proceeding a continuous cheap energy supply that also decreases future costs of running those building saving money in the long term. The government should build nuclear power, we have a simply silly ban in place that should be removed. Just look at France to see the benefits available of cheap clean nuclear energy that also provides jobs across Australia as the entire production cycle from end to end can be completed and done here in Australia

[28-May-20 06:08 PM] SirSentimental#7081
Well I’ll be damned, where was all of this rhetoric from NeatSaucer during the economic discussion? Action or no action? How about sensible action? How about thoughtful and pragmatic action? This is not a problem that only has two answers! I must reiterate that our party believes in the pragmatic approach to the environment. The government can incentivize the market in many different ways, through common-sense fiscal policy all without increasing the likelihood that they shut down 6 months from now! When you take a deep ideological stance, like my opponent, you become blind to good solutions and see only blinding red sirens, pleading for radical action that will serve to our economic detriment. She cries hypocrisy while proving my point; they voted down the LNP’s plan to support environmentally friendly biofuels.  When action is called for, when the economic signs are there, the LNP acts. We rise above the climate hysteria which dominates the dialogue which gets us nowhere. The LNP delivers solutions, we will deliver results.

I would like the three of us to prove to Melbourne that we can have a constructive dialogue about climate change and the environment. The LNP is introducing a bill to the house called the Coal Fired Power Funding Prohibition Act, which will see a sweeping alteration of how fuel consumption, alternative sources of energy and production are done. They also have the Emergency water (Murray Dariling act) would deal with the issues facing rivers and lakes. Common sense, market oriented, optimistic, good for cities like Melbourne, with the long term in mind. Can we cultivate a bit of bi-partisanship? Will the Democrats or SDP candidates work with the government on this issue should they be elected?

[28-May-20 06:18 PM] Pav#1147
Finally, may I ask my fellow from the Liberal National Party to go and have a cup of water and come back with an open mind. Seriously god knows whats wrong with them today. The first paragraph of their response is pure rhetoric and falsehood to be honest. Firstly, I am "he", a male so get your pronouns right. Secondly, Government can incentivise to do Climate Action as well, why forget that. It seems to me that the Liberal Nationals have forgetten the existence of Earth and the fact that it can destory if we take no action now. Pragmatic Action, surprising. If they ever read newspapers and articles, they would understand any country with what they call pragmatic actions, got itself caught in the effects of Climate Change and are suffering. Keep yourself updated, Melbourne needs a MP who knows their stuff.

Next, the question on Bi-partisanship, surprising indeed, because if they remember the recent discussions on a lot of issues, we did cooperate together, and if the Government read its records, they will know that the Coronavirus Economic Package was authored by our leader, NGSpy so cooperation yes. Now, they say they will introduce a Coal Fired Funding Prohibition Bill. Their President's Speech says we will fund coal mines in the budget, which once again comes to my core point on truthfulness, why is the Liberals so hypocritic, can't they take a single wise stand, surprising indeed. Finally, might I remind them, that their policies were just promoting the income of one person and one company and not helping Climate Change, leading to us saying NO to their policies. Climate Action means hard action to protect our future, it means moving to renewable energy, it means, delivering action, it means commiting to our Paris Agreement Obligations, something this Government condemns and it means action not rhetoric and with this, I urge my friend, to go and think about what they said and how wrong it is.

The answer, like I have said countless times, is no, that is unfeasible. I advocate for nuclear energy development, and the LNP is enthusiastic, but that doesn't mean we break laws. Nuclear is low-carbon and where in the world that it has been tried, it has proven results, results which could have resulted in the greenest future of all, a future with little to no carbon emissions, that has been shut down by the SDP when the Removal of Nuclear Energy Prohibitions Bill 2020 was before the house. NGSpy, their leader, also voted and whipped against it. They can't claim to be for a green future and then vote down the greenest future of them all! Now I tried, *I really tried* to offer a constructive dialogue tonight about this issue, but this has become a shouting match, of empty accusations against the government and rhetoric which is divisive and unproductive. Melbourne deserves better, and Melbourne will have better with UrquartTarkin in parliament!

I meant to say that the SDP voted against such an act, and the LNP has since renewed their vision for the alternative. I should also clarify that, from my understanding, the LNP was whipped to support the bill but failure by both parties cause it to fail, by only one vote. It isn't the failure of the LNP but of the House.

As we are concluding the debate, let me take time to highlight our policies and why Melbourne and Melburnians deserve a Social Democrat MP and not ones from the others. First, pragmatism and delivery. We have always delivered our promises to the Australian people, as you may have seen in our previous stints as Government. We delivered a large portion of our promises to our people and electing a SDP MP will just make it easier and facilitate faster. We will also promise a Member of Parliament who is responsible and knows their content unlike the member for the Liberal Nationals who has shown today on National Television their lack of awareness and irresponsibility by going hypocritical and as the previous question shows, they do not back their promises. The Social Democrats will ensure there exists Climate Action, proper economic response for our workers, to ensure each one of you benefit from our policies, counter homelessness, ensure that our minorities are not discriminated and they are treated fairly irrespective of their ethnicity or orientation. We also promise to ensure due recognition of our First People, the Aboriginals and ensure the democratic mandate of our people is implemented and IAA becomes our National Anthem. The Social Democrats have an ambitious plan to reform and overhaul your Public Transport System to ensure you can have a safer and more modern alternative and will follow all the laws and take stances where needed unlike the Liberals, who know none of it. We will ensure that COVID-19 is removed as fast as possible and our country and Melbourne regains its charm and a SDP MP means Melbourne can once again attain the most liveable city in the world ranking. We promise to ensure that you will have a MP who is committed, knows their policies, represents your values and delivers for you. Vote SDP and make the right choice! Let us unite and decide right! Thank you!

@SirSentimental Final statement?


[28-May-20 06:47 PM] SirSentimental#7081
As the Hansard record proves, No party voted for it in its entirety and the independents voted against it too. The failure wasn't on the LNP but of the House collectively. I hope that clears this matter up.

What else is there left to say, you ask? I believe Malcolm Fraser said it best: “Secrecy is completely inadequate for democracy but totally appropriate for tyranny.” This by-election is about freedom, it is about economic and social recovery, it is about finding the road to prosperity, it is about securing our environmental future and it is about the next generation of Melburnians. You have heard all three candidates tonight; one candidate who has repeated the same tired rhetoric, one who has barely spoken, and one who has offered you solutions, ideas and opportunities. Melbourne, the choice could not be more clear! Add your community’s voice to the government benches, where your daily life can become more free, where you get to keep more of your income, where you get to create your own future! 

It’s around now that I get to reflect on this campaign, and how much it has shaped me, no matter the coming result. Folks, I STILL see a golden opportunity to make things truly great here in Melbourne. Our Liberal-National government HAS truly delivered for Australians. It’s strong and sensible response to the COVID-19 pandemic HAS hit the nail straight on the head, protecting gains in economic growth while cracking down on the virus and keeping Australians safe. Getting to meet so many constituents and get our message out there has been an honour, and I trust with confidence that our impact will make itself clear on results night. I await the opportunity to serve Melbourne, in any and all capacities I can, with an open heart and an open mind. Thank you Lachlan and thank you to my opponents, and don’t forget to vote UrquartTarkin!


[28-May-20 06:47 PM] delad#7470
My final statement is simple. Melbourne and Australia have been quite simply let down and disappointed  by the two major parties of the SDP and LNP. We need a candidate who can work with both parties for better outcomes for australia not just butt heads and achieve nothing substantial. People deserve to be properly represented by a candidate that not only cares but is ambitious with a cool experienced head for evidence based policy. I support strongly that we take action on climate change as all evidence possible suggests and says we should. And when is comes to corona before we even think about how to economically recover we must fully recover the health situation. There’s no point going jobs and growth is outbreaks just reappear. So I urge the people in Melbourne to vote for me in the upcoming days in by-election.

Took a little break from media because I probably should every so often


[03-Jun-20 08:35 PM] NGSpy#8096
So, since we were last here before the General Election, you have become the Treasurer of Australia, passing through tax reforms and putting a budget towards the house.


[03-Jun-20 08:35 PM] NGSpy#8096
So this begs the question, why do you live by tax cuts so much as the Treasurer?


[03-Jun-20 08:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because I believe in the Australian people. I believe that Australians who earn their money, have a right to use that money. In a nation who is known worldwide for a fairly uncompetitive economy, we need to make it competitive again and tax cuts are the way to go. If we are to see cars become cheaper, bills to go down and wages to go up; we need to see more competition in this country and tax cuts are the way to go!


[03-Jun-20 08:38 PM] NGSpy#8096
Don't you feel it would be hard to get it passed the SDP-filled senate though?


[03-Jun-20 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Look, the SDP can play games all they want but the Australian people can see through them. Just over $9 billion returns to the pockets of the Australian people who are struggling to make ends meet in a time of crisis. Businesses are struggling and they need as much support as possible including tax relief. If they vote this down, they have no hope of winning the next election and their best move would be to abstain.


[03-Jun-20 08:41 PM] NGSpy#8096
Interesting and definitely a warning to the Social Democratic Party.


[03-Jun-20 08:41 PM] NGSpy#8096

[03-Jun-20 08:44 PM] Pav#1147
It has been great recently, due to COVID restrictions, couldn't venture out and meet really, but I have been having some meetings online with constituents, and I hope to debate the Budget and all of that soon, so it's been good now, let us hope I can do justice to my platform.

So the polls have been recently indicating quite a jump for the Australian Democrats as of recent, what do you feel could be the reason for that?


[03-Jun-20 08:48 PM] Hagrid#3801
We have been working on getting our message out.  Australia is sick of the ideological politics of the SDP and the LNP, they want to hear a moderate voice.  I am proud to say that I am working on a comprehensive new AusDems manifesto that will establish us as a real major party


[03-Jun-20 08:48 PM] NGSpy#8096
That's good to hear probably for many Australians who wish to not confine to the 2 party system.


[03-Jun-20 08:48 PM] NGSpy#8096
So, now onto the group questioning.


[03-Jun-20 08:50 PM] NGSpy#8096
As of recent, there have been riots in the United States of America which were sparked by an incident with a cop kneeing the throat of George Floyd, which led to the death of him. Does the panel feel that the motives behind the riots are justified?


[03-Jun-20 08:50 PM] NGSpy#8096
I'll start with the Treasurer.


[03-Jun-20 08:50 PM] NGSpy#8096
(M: other panel members may start writing their response while the Treasurer is typing his)


[03-Jun-20 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I believe peaceful protests are justified but not Rooting, Looting and Hooting about. That’s not achieving justice, that’s going overboard and trashing people’s livelihoods and cities. Yes, there is an issue in terms of law enforcement and the deaths of suspects in custody, but there is an investigation, the officers have been fired and placed in custody, the judicial process is occurring.


[03-Jun-20 08:54 PM] NGSpy#8096
So you believe that the motives behind the riots are justified, but no necessarily the riots themselves, is that correct Treasurer?


[03-Jun-20 08:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don’t think anything justifies the riots in this case. The government isn’t oppressing people or silencing their voices. I condone the action of peaceful protest and like Floyd’s brother, I stand against the rioters who are trashing the message


[03-Jun-20 08:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
Thank you Griffo, now let's hear what GHagrid has to say about it.


[03-Jun-20 08:56 PM] Hagrid#3801
I am torn, one the one hand I hate to see innocent businesses and people have their hard earned property destroyed and stolen.  But on the other hand there has been no action against police brutality.  Every time the police kill a black person everyone protests but then people forget.  We are all sick of nothing happening, no one should have to suffer what the black community in America has had to suffer.  I hope that the uprising in America brings real change so that there will be no more need for violent looting and destruction.  The protestors should direct their anger not an innocent small businesses but towards the administration that systematically oppresses them.


[03-Jun-20 08:56 PM] NGSpy#8096
A lot on social media hope that as well, with the recent #blackouttuesday hashtag going around.


[03-Jun-20 08:57 PM] Hagrid#3801
Yes it is hard to see which people are genuinely supporting change and who is exploiting the situation for profits and virtue signalling


[03-Jun-20 08:58 PM] Hagrid#3801
people need to understand that changing your profile picture does literally nothing for the black community


[03-Jun-20 08:58 PM] NGSpy#8096
This is an issue for many people I have heard as well. Lets hear what NeatSaucer has to say about it.


[03-Jun-20 09:00 PM] inactive#6974
( @Pav , don't need a huge response don't take too long (


[03-Jun-20 09:02 PM] Pav#1147
So let me begin, the killing of Floyd because some racist police officer wanted to have a time off is definitely condemnable, and it is depressing to see even in today's 21st Century world, we have someone who can discriminate someone on basis of their skin colour, that is completely wrong. As Senator Hagrid pointed out, anytime something similar happens, people protest and forget, that is real sadness. As far as the riots are concerned, I wouldn't appreciate that on any count, but peaceful protests and real action by legal changes is something I would like to see moving forward.


[03-Jun-20 09:03 PM] NGSpy#8096
Thank you for your responses. I understand that for many of you at home that it is a hard discussion to have, but it must be had due to the relevance of it.


[03-Jun-20 09:04 PM] NGSpy#8096
Now to a more Australian news story: the Treasurer has created a new and updated budget for Australia to replace the NGSpy government's budget that was made in March.


[03-Jun-20 09:04 PM] NGSpy#8096
I shall like to start with GHagrid this time on their thoughts on the budget as a whole.


[03-Jun-20 09:07 PM] Hagrid#3801
So this budget is of course effected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  However the government's fiscal response is destructive and I am not pleased with it.  We have seen massive cuts to health and education that are not matched by infrastructure increases.  The treasurer has admitted that he would prefer private schooling as the primary education source in the country.  Because of the governments ineptitude we have seen the nuclear energy bill fail in the house meaning that the government has had to provide funding for a great big dirty coal fired power plant

[03-Jun-20 09:14 PM] Pav#1147
So thank you Alan! So this Budget is what I call a combination of economic irresponsibility and lack of understanding. Let us start with the Appropriations Bill, a lot of necessary funding from our Australian Broadcasting Corp and Special Broadcasting Corp are removed, for what reasons, they do require that funding to run their respective companies, the second is with respect to funding, a lot of funding from crucial departments like Foreign Affairs, Art, Attorney General's Office are all shifted to nowehere. Economic irresponsibility, something I think the Treasurer loves to be a part of. It increases expenditure, cuts down revenue sources and makes the Budget si counter-inutive it is surprising. All of their programs funded are only focused on curbing immigration and not developing the necessary talent sets required which is giving a very negative outlook to the Budget. Finally, on their sense of hypocrisy, during a debate in this very Channel they said that they will not fund coal mines but today they are, so basically the level of irresponsibility and stupidity in this Budget is so high, that Australians have now got an idea of how idiotic their Government aka the three headed monster quoting Senator Hagrid can actually be.

I think what the SDP needs to do is finally hit puberty, because we’re not toddlers anymore and daddy’s money can’t go to the toys you want to play with at an unlimited cost. I mean seriously, we had a budget that was bloated by $65 Billion Hagrid, of course there are going to be cuts to a budget made up on false premises. Compared to real numbers, like the sensible PC budget, we’ve increased and substantially funded our schools, which are mostly funded by the States as per the constitution, and we’re investing tremendously within health. If NeatSaucer wants to act like a desiccated coconut, we can point to fiscal irresponsibility throughout SDP History: a $42 Bn deficit under Youmaton in a time of non-crisis, a $65 Bn deficit as a result of flawed accounting, tax hikes on everyday single Australian business in the midst of the coronavirus, I could go on forever. Now Hagrid, you don’t like the coal power plant, but our plan is to fuel the energy sector with as much diversity as possible; you’re ignoring the hydroelectricity, solar, reactor and wind energy. You’re ignoring some of the largest infrastructure investments in Australian history. You’re ignoring necessary upgrades to the defence force and border security. Fiscal responsibility is about living within our means and to do so, we need to reign it in. When families struggle to pay the rent, they sacrifice food on the table to see a secure home for their family and in turn a successful future for their kids. That’s what we need to, ensure that our kids have the equal opportunities we did and don’t have to pick up the pieces and clean up the mess left by the SDP.

GHagrid, do you have a response?


[03-Jun-20 09:28 PM] Hagrid#3801
Just to go back to your first point about mining companies and then I will respond to the rest.  The mining companies are not going anywhere because we have the largest iron ore reserves in the world so lets get that straight.  Treasurer, the public sector must be maintained to provide everyone with equality of opportunity.  No matter your birth you should have equal opportunity to succeed in our great country.  This is what you are putting at risk with your massive 30 billion cut to health and your push for further privatisation of education.  While you have gained some credibility with your funding of a molten salt reactor you then lost it with the coal power plant.  Also the solar plant in the Northern Territory is a welcome gesture but it could be constructed closer to population centres, transmission costs for that project are going to be enormous.

Australia, you’ve seen it right here. The choices are clear, you have a common sense man at the helm of our chequebook ensuring your children do not have to pick up the pieces of the SDP, whilst maintaining equal opportunities for all Australians in education, energy, employment, health and defence. We’re building up Australia, we’re strengthening the economy and were building your future. There’s a simple rhyme to go with it all- Fiscal Responsibility with the L.N.P, More Debt and Tax with the Social Democrats!

since GHagrid seems bursting to say something, he may go, then NeatSaucer.


[03-Jun-20 09:50 PM] Hagrid#3801
Tonight has proved that we need the Australian Democrats.  I mean the SDP are too busy deciding whether they are socialists or social democrats that they are letting the government get away with ripping our societal fabric.  The LNPs budget rips away any shreds of economic credibility that the Treasurer had going into this term.  Tonight has proved that the Australian Democrats are the home of all the Australians that are sick and tired of ideological political rubbish.  I ask all Australians to join the AusDems we will become a major party then we will win government.  Tonight I have shown Australia the benefits of not being bound to an ideology.  I mean the SDP have no coherent policy ambition, they would have you focus on social policy so that you don't notice their lack of economic policy.  The LNP will destroy any sense of the Aussie fair go in the name of fiscal responsibility.  Australia now is your chance, support the Australian Democrats


[03-Jun-20 09:50 PM] NGSpy#8096
Thank you GHagrid.


[03-Jun-20 09:50 PM] NGSpy#8096
Now onto NeatSaucer.


[03-Jun-20 09:52 PM] Pav#1147
So thank you Alan! A pleasure being a part of this great debate. We were able to make great points across and show why SDP deserves a tick on your ballot paper. Today, we are a point of whether it is responsible governance or twitter meme party, and whether it is a Budget for the people or a Budget for the Elite, and the Social Democrats have repeatedly proven that they deserve your vote and I conclude tonight with the same expression, the people of Melbourne have given us a mandate which we hope can help us ensure that we can have a better Australia. For a Better Australia, one that is inclusive and knows economics, SDP is the choice.

[08-Jun-20 01:37 PM] jinitak#4362
Greetings and welcome to Foreign Affairs Digestible, the only pre-recorded News show that I know of.
With me, Cope Wongcharoen, your local Thai person.

Today, we are talking about the George Floyd killing and related protests and riots and the forced disappearance of Thai political refugee, Wanchalearm Satsaksit.

Let’s start with George Floyd, He was a 46-year-old black man that was killed by a police officer named Derek Chauvin by kneeling on his neck for around 8 minutes and 45 seconds with Floyd yelling “I can’t breathe” many times. Also, the crowd was tried to interfere but the other officers involved stopped them and Chauvin didn’t even lift his knee up when the ambulance came.

After that, the officers have been fired and autopsies showed that Floyd was killed by the police officer. Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter, and the other officers involved were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.

At first, the police was justifying Chauvin’s action by saying that Floyd was resisting arrest. Video evidence was against them. It was shown the Floyd cooperated with the police and the FBI is currently investigating the case.

Let’s look at the officers’ record here;

Derek Chauvin, 44, had been a police officer of MPD for 19 years and he had 18 complaints on his official record, two of which resulted in disciplinary action and he had been involved in three police shootings, one of them fatal. Also, this guy used to work as security with Floyd but it is unknown whether they know each other personally or not.


[08-Jun-20 01:38 PM] jinitak#4362
Tou Thao, 34, He started as a part-time community service officer in 2008 and went through the police academy in 2009. He was laid off for 2 years with he returned to being police in 2012. 6 complaints had been filed against him. In 2014, a man claimed Thao handcuffed him without cause, threw him to the ground, and beaten him, he was hospitalised and the case settled for $25,000

*In a satirical nature*

These are totally fine people. 

*In a serious tone*

I fully agree with them being fired, these type of people should not be police officers as one of the police’s goals is to ensure community trust as the police cannot work effectively without the community trusting them.

Let’s move on.

So, his death caused mass protests where in some places turned into riots starting in Minneapolis. At first, it was a peaceful protest but it turned violent with vandalism of stores and arson of a police station and the police countered them with tear gas and rubber bullets. Many people have said that the police treatment of protesters, in this case, was much more violent than the anti-lockdown protests seen months earlier. 

This protest spread throughout the world with world leaders mostly condemning the killing (rightly in my mind) with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian PM participating in the protests.

In Australia, mass protest happened all over but it is not just about black lives matter but about Indigenous Australian deaths in custody too. Some people have called the protesters, “selfish” while ignoring the cause of protest


[08-Jun-20 01:38 PM] jinitak#4362
Recently the Minneapolis City Council vowing to disband the police department and start a new approach based on communities with the vote passing with enough votes to overturn any veto.

The vandalism and looting have been used by a lot of conservatives as a reason to denounce the entire black lives matter movement. I agree that the vandalism is wrong but you can’t just denounce a movement because of some people. That’s like really s*** (poop emoji added in post over Cope’s mouth and the beep)

In summary, the death of a black American names George Floyd by the knee of a white police officer caused a mass protests against racism with many world leaders condemning the killing. The officers involved were ford and charged for their crimes and Minneapolis city council vowing to abolish the police department.

Next up after this break, we are talking about the forced disappearance of a Thai political refugee.

Welcome back to Foreign Affairs Digestible

With the last story of this episode, the forced disappearance of Thai activist and political refugee Wanchalearm Satsaksit. 

At about 5:54 p.m. on June 4, 2020, a group of armed men abducted Wanchalearm as he walked on the street to buy food in front of his apartment, and took him away in a black car. Wanchalearm’s colleague, who was talking on the telephone with him when the abduction occurred, heard him scream, “Argh, I can’t breathe,” before the call was cut off.

It was said that this act was conducted by the Thai government itself. This is still unverified though. 

Wancharoem is an activist associated with the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship. He fled to Cambodia after the 2014 coup. He was charged with computer crimes after the police alleged that he ran the Facebook page, “I will surely get 100 million Baht from Thaksin” (In Thai).


[08-Jun-20 01:39 PM] jinitak#4362
It is said that any activist in exile in ASEAN will not be save. The current government have been criticised for sending thousands of UDD supporters to “re-education” camps and have tortured at least one of the UDD supporter.

This situation is still ongoing but an ambassador for the Thai branch of the UNHCR said that the UNHCR will not work on this case as it is a “political” matter ignoring the fact that most refugees are refugees because of some political event.

It is said that the Thai branch of the UNHCR is filled with People's Alliance for Democracy supporters which is a known supporter of the Prayut regime. Which might justify their inaction on this matter.

In conclusion, a Thai activist/ political refugee was forced kidnapped possibly by the Thai government with the Thai branch of the UNHCR being silent on the issue and one of their ambassadors was claiming that the UNHCR should not get involved with this case because it is a “political” matter.

Thank you everyone for tuning in to the premiere of Foreign Affairs Digestible. Glad to see you and goodbye!

Today, I won't have any guests on the show tonight, but instead will just talk about some dumb stuff that happened recently in politics, because politics is like sex: you cannot talk about it often, but when you do it's FUN.

So first, just a quick summary of the judicial branch: the High Court.

[02-Jul-20 07:03 PM] NGSpy#8096
The High Court has recently seen 2 cases being presented with Winston_Wilhelmus V Copelonian and Winston_Wilhelmus V SDP


[02-Jul-20 07:04 PM] NGSpy#8096
They are related to a campaign material released by Copelonian saying that he was 'picking up a child from zoom', and WW has been deeply hurt by the incident, describing the characterisation as seeming to a child predator.


[02-Jul-20 07:05 PM] NGSpy#8096
The Deputy Prime Minister has said that he is pursuing the court cases to prove that the SDP and Copelonian were intentionally harming his reputation and only want a singular Australian dollar.


[02-Jul-20 07:06 PM] NGSpy#8096
There has also been another court case that Channel 9 has uncovered where the member for Mayo SnecBoi and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition mikiboss are suing the government for not applying a legislative instrument correctly, as the Biosecurity Act period ended a couple of days ago.

[02-Jul-20 07:11 PM] NGSpy#8096
The Leader of the Opposition, NGSpy, has condemned the letter saying that the DPM was basically making protests sound like the equivalent of saying that cereal causes cancer.

Protests and social gatherings are exactly the same scientifically!

It's like how white people are scientifically the same as muslim people, but I doubt that the Liberal National Party would understand a basic concept such as that. I could be well and truly wrong, but eh who knows?

[02-Jul-20 07:23 PM] NGSpy#8096
The polling numbers as of recent look at NGSpy being in favour by the Australian people and by his electorate, but only by a slim margin, but Griffo is not looking good at all, with polls suggesting he might be kicked out of his electorate if he is not careful.


[02-Jul-20 07:23 PM] NGSpy#8096
Onto the main story tonight: punishment.

[02-Jul-20 07:24 PM] NGSpy#8096
It has been a corner stone of the phrase 'crime and punishment' has been supplied by many means through the years: prison, grounding, the belt and even death.


[02-Jul-20 07:25 PM] NGSpy#8096
The government have during their term whipped out two particular bills in relation to this:

[02-Jul-20 07:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
Lets go over them individually and see what the deal is.


[02-Jul-20 07:27 PM] NGSpy#8096
The Cracking Down on Crime Bill has a pretty basic summary which is the following:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393722834402148352/728187654801195048/Late_Aussie_Night_Segment_Stuff_12.png


[02-Jul-20 07:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
Now it's actually pretty simple and pretty good at first glance. Criminals should be kept in to not cause more crime.


[02-Jul-20 07:28 PM] NGSpy#8096
But there was great opposition by the SDP leader, NGSpy who said:

[02-Jul-20 07:30 PM] NGSpy#8096
He's basically saying that this bill wouldn't deter crime, and that its a simplistic solution which won't work.


[02-Jul-20 07:31 PM] NGSpy#8096
the Prime Minister responded saying:

[02-Jul-20 07:31 PM] NGSpy#8096
*looks confused*


[02-Jul-20 07:32 PM] NGSpy#8096
The bill is literally called the Cracking Down on Crime Bill!

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393722834402148352/728188749133119539/Late_Aussie_Night_Segment_Stuff_15.png


[02-Jul-20 07:32 PM] NGSpy#8096
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN IT ISN'T FOR REDUCING CRIME???


[02-Jul-20 07:32 PM] NGSpy#8096
When you talk about Cracking Down on Drugs, you have the general goal of getting rid of them.


[02-Jul-20 07:32 PM] NGSpy#8096
Also, the ex-prime minister said this about the bill:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393722834402148352/728188965861195806/Late_Aussie_Night_Segment_Stuff_16.png


[02-Jul-20 07:33 PM] NGSpy#8096
Which pretty much implies that the bill is actually about cracking down on crime...


[02-Jul-20 07:33 PM] NGSpy#8096
and trying to deter it.


[02-Jul-20 07:34 PM] NGSpy#8096
So me and my research team did some research on increasing sentences and figured out some misconceptions about it:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393722834402148352/728189381395087450/Late_Aussie_Night_Segment_Stuff_17.png


[02-Jul-20 07:34 PM] NGSpy#8096
So lets go over these points individually.


[02-Jul-20 07:35 PM] NGSpy#8096
1) Increasing Sentences has no link to crime reduction whatsoever.


[02-Jul-20 07:39 PM] NGSpy#8096
A quote from the US Justice Department states:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393722834402148352/728190726550192128/Late_Aussie_Night_Segment_Stuff_18.png


[02-Jul-20 07:41 PM] NGSpy#8096
Its really interesting to think about for a second, that prisons allow a way for those who commit crimes to socialise with other criminal to make their crimes much better for them and worse for the parties involved.


[02-Jul-20 07:42 PM] NGSpy#8096
2) encourages prison overcrowding


[02-Jul-20 07:42 PM] NGSpy#8096
In general there is an obvious principal:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393722834402148352/728191377300783134/Late_Aussie_Night_Segment_Stuff_19.png


[02-Jul-20 07:45 PM] NGSpy#8096
this can be extremely dangerous in COVID-19, where overcrowding of prison systems allow for disease to be spread more easily, and prisons can become petri dishes, but I will get onto that later.


[02-Jul-20 07:45 PM] NGSpy#8096
3) it's more expensive


[02-Jul-20 07:46 PM] NGSpy#8096
The governments that run the prisons have to produce money in order to keep prisoners, and increasing sentences would increase the amount of revenue that go towards it.


[02-Jul-20 07:46 PM] NGSpy#8096
For example:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393722834402148352/728192418184167464/Late_Aussie_Night_Segment_Stuff_20.png


[02-Jul-20 07:54 PM] NGSpy#8096
4) It is terrible in COVID-19


[02-Jul-20 07:54 PM] NGSpy#8096

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/393722834402148352/728194340526096434/Late_Aussie_Night_Segment_Stuff_21.png


[02-Jul-20 07:55 PM] NGSpy#8096
Prison staff have to work in the prisons which are going to be more overcrowded, and they can become literal petrid dishes


[02-Jul-20 07:56 PM] NGSpy#8096
it has already done tremendous harm in the United States where loads of COVID-19 cases has spread throughout prisons.


[02-Jul-20 07:57 PM] NGSpy#8096
Now onto the other bill: the death penalty bill.

[02-Jul-20 07:59 PM] NGSpy#8096
The Death Penalty bill was extremely controversial in many aspects in parliament


[02-Jul-20 07:59 PM] NGSpy#8096
these are shown by these points:

[02-Jul-20 08:01 PM] NGSpy#8096
sorry Amnesty US


[02-Jul-20 08:01 PM] NGSpy#8096
There is literally no scientific evidence to show crime reduction


[02-Jul-20 08:02 PM] NGSpy#8096
And it is just a cruel measure


[02-Jul-20 08:02 PM] NGSpy#8096
that forces the question: should my child be killed for this?


[02-Jul-20 08:02 PM] NGSpy#8096
and that is terrible


[02-Jul-20 08:03 PM] NGSpy#8096
2) it is not reliable


[02-Jul-20 08:04 PM] NGSpy#8096
Lots of lethal injections in the united states are botched and cause extreme pain


[02-Jul-20 08:04 PM] NGSpy#8096
and it also causes loads of prisoners who were actually innocent to die


[02-Jul-20 08:05 PM] NGSpy#8096
3) It cannot actually be administered by proper authoritires, because doctors are under the hippocratic oath of do no harm

some of the anesthetics are not even effective at getting rid of the pain that is caused from the paralyzation and the cardiac arrest injections
