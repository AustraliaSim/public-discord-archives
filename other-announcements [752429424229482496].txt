this channel will be used for announcements which arent explicit to aussim, such as major covid updates (or other times where we deliver disaster updates) or anything else we feel like announcing which isnt to do with the operation of the sim

There is room for genuine health talk within the discord. however one should be careful when discussing that of a sexual nature. Medical chat should be not be done in general (keep this to generaler or something), however such should be kept sensible with due note that aussim is not a doctor's office. 

Any nsfw topics that are strictly health related that are brought up of this nature in any channel should have their entire contents spoilered (|| on both sides of the message), as to ensure people who do not wish to see certain material aren't subject to it.

If health related topics move off track into  inappropriate or irrelevant discussion, the community managers will try to move the conversation back on topic or shut down the conversation entirely.


[28-Sep-20 10:05 PM] Youmaton#1190
Let me put emphasis on the most important note here once again.

Aussim. Is. Not. A. Doctors. Office.

If you have health concerns, visit a doctor. If you are struggling with your mental health (speaking of I'll be doing a post on this soon), the community is here for you, however we are not professionals and can not give the advice a medical professional could provide

Update on things folks:

Calculator is finally in working order again (excluding the griffo v ngspy calculator which remains a mystery to me), looking to get things properly up and running tomorrow and get polls out in conjunction with the by-election results.

These byelections may not have polls unfortunately, however at the current rate we will still have results to celebrate!

From the mod side of things regarding arguments over the ACT statehood referendum:

The result of the referendum is as published, no point arguing over that.

If people want actual canon numbers, remind me on the weekend and I'll see what I can throw together.

As for future referenda, that's a matter for debate within canon, just as any such constitutional proposals that come forward. If/when a proposal passes (for any matter), the mod team will discuss it and decide the best path forward


[27-Nov-20 05:52 AM] Youmaton#1190
Regarding matters accused upon within the recent speaker vonc.

As lily said, contents of voice chats are not canon unless specifically designated as such by a mod team member (voice debates, etc.) or are within a space already designated as such (cabinet vc, canon voice interviews, etc.).

If you suspect someone is using meta in order to stop things progressing in canon (as alleged within this incident), please contact the parliamentary moderator or any other mod team member. We will take these allegations seriously, and review them as need be.

We now have a new poll bot. This bot has replaced the need for the user known as "doctor#0002" who advocated for its introduction. It can be used in the same manner as the old bot.

@+NTWA 

Mark McGowan has ordered a lockdown of Perth, Peel and the South West Regions. A list of the places shut down can be found in #covid-ukraine-and-current-topics, however there will now be only 4 reasons to leave your home. A mask mandate is also now in place.

**WA Covid-19 Update 31/01/21**
‚Ä¢ 1 confirmed case from a Hotel Quarantine Worker who has most likely caught the UK variant of the Coronavirus
‚Ä¢ The Regions of Perth, Peel and South West are going into a 5 day lockdown starting today
‚Ä¢ Masks in these regions are now mandatory
‚Ä¢ Restaurants, cafes, entertainment facilities, outdoor recreation facilities, places of worship, libraries are closed.
‚Ä¢ You will not be allowed visit hospitals, aged care or disability care facilities. 
‚Ä¢ Schools in WA will be having an extra week of holidays and will not open to students as was planned for Monday. 
‚Ä¢ There are only four (4) reasons to leave your home, - Shopping for essentials, - Medical or healthcare needs including caring for the vulnerable if necessary, - Exercise for one hour per day with one other person, -For work and education if you cannot work or study from home
‚Ä¢ The lockdown will be assessed consistently and may be lifted earlier if need be. 
‚Ä¢ The overarching fear is due to the high possibility of community transmission of the UK or South African variant of Coronavirus which is more infectious and according to recent studies possibly more deadly.

Welcome Parliamentarians to the 19th Term! It's a pleasure to have you with us. 

Hopefully the Government's Presidential Address will be completed by Thursday, where the first round of bills, motions and MPIs will be introduced for debate. We are accepting submission of business to put onto the order paper, so get in quick!
In the meantime, please swear in and nominate for Speakership if you are interested. 

Best of luck, and remember to always *have a fun time chatting with people, talking about politics, and of course, debating Bills before the Parliament!*

Any other questions, please DM me or any clerks and we will do our best to answer! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I will most likely not be available often on the 4th, and Friday and Saturday due to my birthday and then related celebrations.

If any presidential functions are needed during that time, I would suggest contacting PC.

Failing that, you can fill my inbox until I eventually respond. I will attempt to resolve all outstanding business before that period begins so that nothing is waiting on me going in.

Full list of things now in #covid-ukraine-and-current-topics.

If you have been in any of the designated sites, or have *any* symptoms, get a test tomorrow morning (there are no excuses for not doing so)

There will now be mandatory masks from midnight tonight, and all indoor meets have returned to a maximum of 15.

An abundance of caution is needed, as this case has been highlighted to potentially be a british strain case.

@+VIC Be careful, social distance, wear a mask, and look after yourselves.

**NOTICE FROM SPEAKER**
Actually write explanatory memorandums with your bills and explain what your bill does. 

It. is. not. hard. 

If you do not do so as an MP I will deliberately sanction your bill from being placed on the order paper. If you need an template, I have made a new one that looks more similar to IRL. You need a compatibility with human rights statement under Part 3 of the *Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011*, and for the sake of other members of the Simulator, you need to explain what your act does in **PLAIN ENGLISH**. Please let me know if you have any trouble. The explanatory memorandums are designed so that people do not have to be a mega nerd to understand what an Act does, so please do it well.

@Senator The Motion to Amend the Standing Orders - Senate Inquiries has reached the threshold of 5 Aye votes to be enacted, so congratulations, you have some new powers. Members of the public will also be able to engage in the process but **not** members of the House of Representatives unless specifically asked for by Senators.

How it works is this: you have two stages to a Senate Inquiry-
> Questioning Stage, where you can ask any person called up by the submitting Senator 3 questions for **each person** with an allowance of two follow-up questions each. You can also ask general members of the public 3 questions if they wish to participate.
and,
> Information Consolidation and Consideration Stage, where you can submit any pieces of information that you wish to be considered in the inquiry to be submitted. Every piece of information that is submitted must be featured in the inquiry in some shape or form.

Both stages may be participated in by members of the public, but **not** members of the House of Representatives unless specifically asked by senators.

For now while the options on the form are not available, you may either use the **MOTION** section or dm the Speakership the following information:
> - The topic of your inquiry
> - Your own copy of **THIS DOCUMENT** with the title page complete: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18oKTAguvzF0h5Cru5hG9G1DHFMUFRX6y16jl6SX8_J8/edit?usp=sharing
> - ANY MPs, Senators or extremely authoritative Australian figures (eg Commissioner for Taxation, Governor of the RBA, etc.)

Remember to keep on top of this, as your senate inquiry will be publish once it goes through the stages. Have fun Senators.

**COMMUNITY COMMISSION ANONYMOUS DROPBOX**

G‚Äôday AusSim,

The Community Commission is seeking to become quite active in order to fulfil our aim of providing a sufficient link between the Moderation Team and the community. As such, the community commission would like to hear from you directly in order for us to get a feel for how fellow AusSimmers feel about various aspects. 

This means that we will be opening a temporary Anonymous DropBox. The purpose is for AusSimmers to anonymously make complaints about any aspect of AusSim they despise, would like to see improved, or know others are concerned about. This involves both meta and canon aspects of AusSim.

 (i.e. The Houses of Parliament/Press/Events/Campaigning/Party Registration/The High Court/Community Management/Code of Conduct/Meta Procedures/Community Engagement/Speakership, etc.)

Feel free to drop as many complaints as you like, as colloquially as you like, even if you don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôd ideally want it to be improved. The community commission is here to take your concerns on board and devise solutions, take the, to the Mod Team and create a more engaging community environment.

This DropBox is temporary, will last until around Sunday-ish.

A quick update re polling & the VoC.

The result of the vote of confidence will not affect polling this week, which I will release on Sunday around the usual time. If I do not reach 65%, I shall resign with immediate effect after the releasing of the poll. Please do not take this post as an attempt to influence a vote either way, I just wished to alleviate any concerns around if the poll would come out this week.

Today reflects one year since most states shut down and went into lockdown for the first time. The past 12 months have been difficult, however it has been incredible to watch to many talented people come together here to discuss ongoing matters and work to make a better tomorrow on the other side of the pandemic. 

Whilst we aren't out of the pandemic yet, things are beginning to get better, and it shows that there are always more sunrises to look forward too. Thank you all for being here over the last 12 months as we fought off the pandemic, hopefully in another 12 months time we will be able to return to relative normality.

A reminder for @MP and @Senator regarding seeking leave. It doesn't have to be the person seeking leave that needs to move a motion. It can be any parliamentarian. If you know a member (particularly within your party) requires leave you can move a motion for a leave of absence for them.

The motion expires once the time has ended or the Parliamentarian in question enters the chamber (in sim this means voting, debating, other comment within the house subreddits or commenting within the hose floor or senate floor on discord)

@Parliamentarian because im feeling a bit shit today and because I think it'd be nice to take a breather from QTs, there is no QT this Sunday or Saturday. According to the form the most requested time for QT and the one that is least opposed is 6:00pm on a Thursday. We shall commence QT then. Ping me to remind me

as an addition to this, Thursday's pretty frigging weird for the most preferred timing, so if members don't show up, don't berate them for it in canon or in meta. That's like the number 2 unwritten rule of AusSim

I will, with the exercise of power as Speaker subject to if lily doesn't allow it, make special consideration for it in terms of debating times and voting times. I will try to make it 72 hours for each as the budget is quite important. Okay cheers üôÇ

Just a quick note.

As y‚Äôall know, I like to do stuff the Griffo way and that‚Äôs the way I like to do it. Nice, quick and easy. The Griffo way however, is often opposed because it is brash. So then it doesn‚Äôt become quick and nice, it does end up becoming quite heated lmao.

So I‚Äôd like to take the time to acknowledge and thank speakership, particularly NGSpy for not only working hard around the clock to make sure things do end up running smoothly but also for putting up with my brashness to get things done to my advantage, often known as ‚Äòbullshit‚Äô lol. It‚Äôs appreciated though because you do work hard, and I know I need to pull it back a bit haha. But at the end of the day we‚Äôre still good mates, just as we all are here and nothing is done personally, just politics.

Anyway, thanks NGSpy for the hard work you do, and thanks for being a good mate. Always enjoy the political banter and the debates, and I look forward to keeping up the intensity of the debates.

Thanks again mate for the effort you put in! Just thought I‚Äôd note some appreciation because it‚Äôs been quite rapid recently and noticed the need for rest, which is well-deserved on your part.

Cheers,
Griffo.

Okay just a notice to members and especially government members about how legislative instruments work:
(1) To submit a legislative instrument, you first Gazette it to 'give notice', and then you table it by the submission form.
(2) In order to repeal a legislative instrument, you have to move a motion on the post for tabling within 15 days to disallow the instrument. This can be done in the House or the Senate.
(3) You cannot amend legislative instruments, unless you have another legislative instrument.
(4) Government members who have administration over an act 'present' the legislative instrument. The Prime Minister is a wildcard that can do anything, but I prefer to associate with administration ministers.
any questions just ask me

I am not necessarily in great shape right now, having had some events lately that have rather distressed me, capped off by me backing into another car the other day


[03-May-21 01:13 PM] Lucifer Morningstar#6969
More often than not I have been very anxious, stressed, and it's possible I've been ruder than called for in some cases

Alrighty,

I'm close to reaching a consensus of voters with the polls. Some interesting results so far.

If I can receive a couple more, I'll have results up within fifteen to twenty minutes after that.

I'll only be releasing the results of the individuals who have voted (with exception to those who have asked to not have theirs released). **If you want to change your mind about having your results public, please message me as soon as possible.**

Poll going down in ten minutes. After that, no more submissions.


[11-Jun-21 10:04 AM] Perekai#6805
Here are the results.

After polling roughly 40% of the current meta voting roll, we have managed to find a few candidates who can pass the threshold.

First of all, apologies for double ups on the candidates - the list was ripped from the current meta voter roll and I had failed to read closely.

Also, members who have been awaiting verification for more than two weeks were not in the list for candidacy but their votes were counted.

These results only consist of who had voted and also not requested to have their results private.

You may request your results privately if you had elected to keep them private. If you did not vote and want your results, you'll have to vote in the poll first, and I will create a revision if there is a substantial change in results.

The three candidates who hit past the threshold (and who also voted and did not request private results), are Ash, Youma, and Perekai. 


TheAudibleAsh        77.78%
Youmaton        70.59%
Perekai            68.42%
THRESHOLD        65.00%
GenericCerealHere    63.16%
lily-irl        57.89%
ThanksHeadMod        45.00%
Griffonomics        42.11%
Winston_Wilhelmus    38.89%
showstealer1829        29.41%
NeatSaucer        29.41%
riley8583        27.78%
jq8678            26.32%
model-kyosanto        17.65%
buttsforpm        16.67%
SprinklyDinks        11.11%

[11-Jun-21 10:04 AM] Perekai#6805
When counting Unsure/Do Not Want To Answer votes, we can create a potential margin of error.

The top three candidates have a potential MOE:

Ash at         5.56%
Youma at     5.88%
Perekai at     0% (No Unsure/Do Not Want To Answer votes)


These results are not gospel, naturally. The shift of votes can change dramatically if only three people vote against the Ash, the candidate of the highest threshold. Nonetheless, this provides a general outline of whom may or may not command 65% of the vote. 


At the moment, there are two other anonymous candidates who hold a margin of 50% to 65%, and one anonymous candidate who holds 65%<. 


I will be reopening the poll, so if I receive more votes, I will release a revised results sheet.


Best of luck to all candidates!

Hey @MP if you want amendments considered, **REPLY TO THE AUTOBOT** at the **SECOND READING**, otherwise speakership won't know you want amendments considered! It really cramps our style, man!
This also applies to @Senator with any money bills you want to apply requested amendments to.

Hey @MP and @Senator. The first instrument has been tabled for this term, so I'm just gonna remind you of the rules surrounding it. The instrument post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaSimLower/comments/nzj237/sli2001_customs_legislation_amendment_saudi/

Any MP or Senator can debate it, or call for a motion to disallow the instrument. If someone motions for an instrument to be disallowed, it means they want it **repealed**. The motion will be presented in the House where the member comes from (if its a Senator, the Senate, if its an MP, the House), and then there will be debate. An instrument must be disallowed within 15 days of tabling. This is the one thing that is not scaled back in terms of time periods in AustraliaSim.

Have fun gaining extra mods. Also hahah get pinged on reddit >:)

Hey all, as you all know I was the subject of a coup by all of you in an effort to discriminate against penguins.

In all seriousness, I understand the need for the amendment, and I am glad that I could do what I did as a Community Manager. To be quite honest I was planning to run for Parliamentary Moderator to get out of canon, but instead I plan to be a good clerk who will be happy to help with bill writing and advertising if needed.

I'll also try and remain active in Community Commission to make this server better, as ultimately it was my firt political simulator and it holds a special place in my heart. Especially because I spent 9 months as Prime Minister on this server. For now I'll continue my duties as usual, but thanks for trusting me as a community manager.

Thanks all,
NGSpy

@+SA 
From midnight tonight, a number of restrictions will come into effect in South Australia as a pre-emptive strategy against the Delta variant, despite recording no cases of the strain.

The restrictions will last for at least one week, SA premier Steven Marshall said.

- Masks will become mandatory in high-risk health settings including residential aged care facilities, hospitals and personal care settings. (Masks will only be highly recommended for public transport).
- Private gatherings across SA will be capped at 150 people.
- A density range of one person per two square metres will be reintroduced, and there will be restrictions to reintroduce seated consumption (drinking) indoors, limits on buffet-style venues, and banning the use of communal facilities within shisha bars.
- Singing will be banned for the next week (excluding performers and educational facilities).

@+NTWA 
Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner has announced the lockdown in place for Darwin, Palmerston and Litchfield will be extended by 72 hours, until 1pm on Friday.

Gunner also announces a new case - a Darwin man in his 50s who is a close contact of an earlier case linked to the gold mine in the Tanami desert.

The new case is a fly in fly out worker who left the mine site on Friday 25 June.

He was transferred to the Howard Springs quarantine centre a day later, but was in the community for about 36 hours while infectious.


[28-Jun-21 01:59 PM] Perekai#6805
For the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, Michael Gunner says the Northern Territory has Covid exposure sites.

Just three more things:
- I am satisfied with 3 bill items per cycle, but I am open to suggestions about how to run business next term :). Even if the idea is to merge the two half-weekly cycles into one weekly cycle I would be very interested to hear it.
- With the passage of my Royal Commissions bill, the next government can do royal commissions! Very cool ain't it? (The current Government can do it as well if they want lmao)
- I seriously need ideas to boost activity, and I hope to integrate this with IRL standing orders so we don't have to refer to two documents.
If I am not Speaker I shall serve as a Clerk next term, mainly for the House of Reps. Thanks all.
Regards,

Since I can't ping parliamentarians at the moment, I won't, but I'll let you all know of the following:
(1) Speakership have integrated a weeks break for this term, that shall be from the 30th of August to the 5th of September. No business can be posted then (not even legislative instruments).
(2) On the main spreadsheet, we have calendars now for important dates and for when Activity Checks will be and when cycles of business occur. We will add dates of other things as they come up, like by-elections, upcoming events, etc.
(3) Join speakership if you are an MP or Senator. We need to train more people and me and Slater are not gonna sign up to be President or Speaker

@Parliamentarian Hey all, congrats on winning the election or welcome to your 2nd Term to those Senators. I'm giving this role so I can get some stuff done with haste. First of all, read the above, especially leaders and contacts because damn its pretty cool.

**QT Timing**
Please fill out this survey by this Sunday so I know when to Schedule Question Time. The one that has the least 'I cannot do this day' will be the day: https://forms.gle/2rcfoPRnSU7bFhAj6

**Basic Info about what you should expect**
Currently, we have 3 items of business per *cycle*, which is 3 days long. We have a cycle from Monday to Thursday, and from Thursday to Sunday. Sunday to Monday is a rest day. I may propose that there can be 4 items of business from Thursday to Sunday. Please don't just do it last minute, thats a pretty dumb idea. You can ask for extensions from the Electoral Commission in #extensions. These only apply to debating generally. Voting is done within 72 hours.

Speakership will check if you have been active using requirements. Just vote consistently and debate at least once every 2 weeks and you're fine. 2 strikes and you're out.

**Give Suggestions**
Let us (Speakership) know what'd you'd like to see. Cheers all

**ACT Lockdown**

The ACT will enter into lockdown for 7 days from 7pm tonight, due to one new case.

The usual 5 reasons to leave home apply and it can be assumed non-essential retail will shut.

More to come when Barr speaks at 12:15

Interested in representing your state (or even country) on an international level? Interested in global politics and want to contribute your unique ideas? Aged 18-29?

If yes, you might be interested to hear that the Commonwealth Youth Parliament is being held this October. Every legislature is allowed to send 2 delegates to help bring forth ideas on how to improve the Commonwealth, and discuss the problems the global community is facing.

If you are interested, please see the Commonwealth Youth Parliament website. Applications are very dependent on jurisdiction, and some might not still be open, but if you are at all interested you should take a look!

Note to MPs: There is two pieces of mining tax legislation in there because they are related to each other.
I do plan to address cognate billage at some point in the future with amendments to standing orders for efficiency and so this doesn't have to happen.
Have good debate cycle.
Also @Government answer your goddamn questions or I'm considering proposing to Perekai to carry over unanswered questions into next QT and making mod penalties for it.

Quick Note to @Parliamentarian . Just to let you know that I shall be exercising Clerk powers to amend legislation to make them better quality on B2113, because it literally does nothing right now. It will not subvert the intentions of the bill *at all* and infact make it so that the bill goals are met. I shall ask the CLP leadership if my amendments are adequate when they are done.
These same powers were put on SB2105 by normal procedure, so there is no need to confer with other people.

Today is World Mental Health Day.

Make sure to take care of yourself, and if you need help to get it. 

In Australia there‚Äôs heaps of services available, online, over the phone and in person. Whether that‚Äôs Kids Helpline/Lifeline, your Doctor, Therapist or Psychologist. Getting help is never something to be ashamed of.

This year a key issue identified by the WHO for World Mental Health Day has been burnout from lockdowns, working from home, and I think we can apply that issue here too. Make sure you always put yourself first, and real life comes first. Never feel pressured to deliver on model world commitments when you have your own you need to deal with. Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic a lot of mental health issues have been exacerbated and we need to make sure we‚Äôre all looking after ourselves.

You never know what someone else is dealing with either, so let‚Äôs try and be kind to each other, and have some understanding about what other people might be experiencing.

More info at the website for today below:
