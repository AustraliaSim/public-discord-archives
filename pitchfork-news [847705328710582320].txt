Tim Schenectady Pitchfork News!!


[29-May-21 08:48 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Pitchfork has reason to believe that hype for the so-called "Bang Duo" is misplaced, and 'Axel F' will comfortably maintain its place on the charts.


[29-May-21 08:54 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Pitchfork is predicting that the charts will be good for Taylor Swift Stans and fans of comedy podcast "Episode 1"

Tim Schenectady from Pitchfork News here to say: fuck you!! Fuck you to Talk of the AusSim Charts


[30-May-21 07:19 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
We received an absurd projection that didn't include Axel F by Crazy Frog. Pitchfork, of course, chose not to publish this, and stick with our guns


[30-May-21 07:20 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And we were right! Axel F has topped the charts again, and just like I FUCKING predicted, we have Taylor Swift and Episode 1 in there as well


[30-May-21 07:20 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
This is my message to Talk of the AusSim Charts: you are nothing. Dust under my shoe. I am a music analyst with university training and years of experience. Get fucked. You have been defeated

BREAKING!


[29-Aug-21 09:54 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Pitchfork News understands the JLA's candidate at the Sydney by-election, imfeelingcorny, has LEFT the party to become an Independent


[29-Aug-21 09:55 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
This represents a catastrophic moment for the JLA just moments after they reported 1.5% in a recent poll. It remains to be seen how Joseph will react, or if there is even a future for the JLA.

[31-Aug-21 10:12 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
On these numbers, it is overwhelmingly clear that the ACT remains #NotReady for statehood!

[31-Aug-21 10:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Ah yes, the MLastCelebration strategy of running for a by-election in Sydney!


[31-Aug-21 10:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
It's clear from these numbers that the most important thing you can do is run for a by-election


[31-Aug-21 10:14 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
After all, that's how TheSensibleCentre first won Canberra, by running for constant by-elections -- such as Denison and Nicholls.


[31-Aug-21 10:14 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I think the problem is that TheSensibleCentre, being MP for Canberra, has not been able to run in enough by-elections.


[31-Aug-21 10:14 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So true!


[31-Aug-21 10:15 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
I think I would suggest that she resign on a monthly basis, to ensure that the people of Canberra #NeverForget that she is the right choice.


[31-Aug-21 10:15 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Or, perhaps it's a sign that Independents are #Finished


[31-Aug-21 10:17 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Perhaps.


[31-Aug-21 10:17 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Either way, I think there's one very important thing to take from this: The Independent Group have FAILED


[31-Aug-21 10:19 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
True!


[31-Aug-21 10:19 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
That the SDP's relatively unknown Trongle is MORE THAN DOUBLE the high-profile leader of the Independent Group


[31-Aug-21 10:20 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
That says something...


[31-Aug-21 10:20 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Their radical and dangerous message of Canberra statehood has been outright rejected by ACT residents.


[31-Aug-21 10:21 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The ACT will NEVER be a state.


[31-Aug-21 10:21 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
While the ACT is #NotReady, I am #Ready to go to sleep. Goodnight.


[31-Aug-21 10:21 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

[31-Aug-21 10:22 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

We have a poll that's adjusted for the effects of the Sydney by-election. By adjusted, I mean, we imagine that by-election didn't happen, since MLastCelebration has a high profile purely due to that

Hello everyone! It's Tim Schenectady, Pitchfork News, here with an EXCLUSIVE interview with the Deputy Prime Minster


[14-Sep-21 06:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The Deputy Prime Minister comes to us fresh off the heels of a massive victory in the High Court, as the Government has just #WonTheCase that so much was riding on.


[14-Sep-21 06:09 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Thank you for joining me, @Gregor The Beggar


[14-Sep-21 06:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Hello, thanks for having me today Tim


[14-Sep-21 06:12 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
You know what is even better than appearing on this fine program, an ice cold Ginger Beer straight from North Queensland factories and North Queensland sugar


[14-Sep-21 06:12 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Wow! I couldn't agree more.


[14-Sep-21 06:12 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Which I am enjoying right now to celebrate our victory today!


[14-Sep-21 06:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
And of course, I'm sure that those sugar farmers will be happy the Government is giving them a steady supply of water through the desalination program, but we can get to that later.


[14-Sep-21 06:13 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now, for our first question. Obviously, this is a huge win for the Government, and a complete humiliation for the Liberals. Are you calling on 12MaxWild to resign for his role in supporting this obstructionist case?


[14-Sep-21 06:17 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Oh absolutely, the Liberal Party has undertaken a dreadful policy here where their court case alleged that the Government's entire deployment was illegal and railed against the Government's policy in the press. I'm a disciplined man and didn't respond to them, as I'd rather wait for the court case to decide their ruling. Winston Wilhelmus and his puppet master 12MaxWild are entirely at fault here for their actions as they tried in their very own submission to argue the deployment as a whole was illegal. They got proven wrong and now they're trying to cover their tracks, claiming they were only concerned about the technicality of the law. That is a blatant lie and they know it. They stopped the order and put workers in danger and if the court ruled that the whole deployment was illegal, they'd be happy and touting the line it was a victory. Their entire aim was to leave workers unsafe and vulnerable to the protests they support and they've failed, their now on damage control


[14-Sep-21 06:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
12MaxWild must resign for endangering the lives of every hard-working union man on the job, people with families and livelihoods. A brick through a ute window could be a beat squad or a team of amateur arsonists the next day. Who knows what a crowd whipped up can do and the Liberal Party trying to score political points is pushing for these protests to become more radical by acting intentionally contrarion.


[14-Sep-21 06:20 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now, on the topic of worker safety, model-vivienne has been publicly calling for workers to take this into their own hands -- to defend themselves. Do you think, with this kind of rhetoric, that the lack of AFP at construction sites to could lead to all out brawls and potentially even deaths?


[14-Sep-21 06:22 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I admire some of the action of model-vivienne but workers should be the bigger men and not retaliate or take action into their own hands. Two crowds brawling in an undisciplined mob will lead to injuries and deaths and we are trying to prevent that by stepping in with the AFP and other forces.


[14-Sep-21 06:22 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Which is where I'd like to announce something to the people of Australia right now, brand new information


[14-Sep-21 06:22 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Wow!


[14-Sep-21 06:23 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Me and the Minister, BestinBounds, have been in contact with many State Premiers of Australia and I have requested state police to move in with their far greater resources to help defend the desalination plants if possible. Many of them have proven conducive to the idea and offered valid support and criticism of the program which the Minister has taken. The Minister has been hard at work and on the frontlines discussing the matter with them and we will be ensuring safety firsthand


[14-Sep-21 06:25 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Unions have called for more security and we will be delivering that to them. They want this kind of protection and the workers want protection, the best protection delivered is by a combined state and federal effort to protect lives


[14-Sep-21 06:26 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well this is a huge announcement, and I'm sure many workers will be glad to hear it. How long has this been in the works?


[14-Sep-21 06:27 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Since the start of the court case we've been hard at work on this front talking with the states and the unions on this front. I'm proud to say we've gotten somewhere with these talks and with their permission and consent, it is good to know there are many in the country who will support greater desalination plant security


[14-Sep-21 06:28 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Circling back around to the issue of the desalination plants, there have been some in the Greens who seem less than 100% on more plants. What do you say to your coalition partners, and to those who protests these plants on an environmental basis?


[14-Sep-21 06:33 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Our coalition partners can keep any opinion which they wish on the matter but the majority support the desalination schemes and they support the expansion of these schemes. It is coalition policy to expand these plants and I will be pursuing that firmly within the budget, I expect my coalition partners to shape up and do the same. I have absolute faith in TheSensibleCentre as well to support these plants and support these schemes as the plan is quite sensible and helps farmers massively!


[14-Sep-21 06:35 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I do have it on good authority from Government Sources that TheSensibleCentre has been an outspoken advocate of these plants, so I'm sure you'll be in luck there!


[14-Sep-21 06:35 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Now, as to those farmers... Do you have anything to say to the farmers tonight, on the back of your massive win?


[14-Sep-21 06:38 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The farmers will see clean, safe water delivered to them at low cost and the Government will be buying back their water quotas in Environmental Buybacks to help preserve the health of our river system. If your a farmer in drought country, your receiving billions in support right now due to Country Labor Party programs and now this water will directly seek to end the crisis you face right now. The farmers of Australia won tonight and the CLP is delivering to all of our promises we made to you. I am immensely humbled to say that I did this and it is deeply emotional to me that this is coming into place. I- I find th-

*tears form in his eyes*


[14-Sep-21 06:39 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm so glad that the people I saw struggling which encouraged me to enter politics are finally getting the support they need. I'm immensely proud to have done by service to them there


[14-Sep-21 06:40 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I think of the old and young Islander folks working the sugarcane fields up in Queensland with me back in the summer of '93, I think of the New South Wales farmers all around Cessnock who have been genuinely struggling and who've told me in tears about how life is getting tougher and tougher for them


[14-Sep-21 06:40 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Making this kind of change is why I got into politics and I'm so thankful to the community for giving me the chance to do it


[14-Sep-21 06:41 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
*very manly tears stream down Gregor's cheek before he gets a tissue and cleans it up, straightening himself back up and looking professional again*


[14-Sep-21 06:41 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
What a beautiful, heartrending story.


[14-Sep-21 06:41 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I love this country and love its people so much!

I haven't been this moved since Martin Septim's sacrifice to end the Oblivion Crisis and usher in the Fourth Era.

[14-Sep-21 06:42 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
That's a beautiful note to end our interview on. Thank you so much, Deputy Prime Minister, for your time.


[14-Sep-21 06:42 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
