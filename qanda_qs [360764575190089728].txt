Greyhound racing prohibition is a popular topic in parliament at the moment. How do you propose to find the perfect balance between banning an inhumane sport and supporting the dogs and people of the sport in their endeavour to find new homes and reinvent their livelihoods respectively? Is two years really enough time to phase out the sport? How is it possible to find homes for 300,000 greyhounds when the standard adoption rate for dogs is 88%, and greyhounds even lower at 50%? Those stats don't consider the effects of an influx of new greyhounds looking for adoption.

Here's a writing prompt for you people: A man shoots and kills the Dutch Ambassador. When taken to court the killer says he did it in retaliation against the Dutch army's failure to stop the Srebrenica genocide. The media promptly blames the genocide just like how they blamed DOOM for Columbine.

Does the panel agree that those who think being transgender is a mental illness, only do so because they have insufficient brain pan size, leading to  a constriction of blood flow to the frontal cortex, and a predisposition towards degeneracy caused by the urban lifestyle of the modern world?

"Can the panel please translate whatever the fuck MTM said?"
basically proto-nazis believed that socially 'different' people were physically different


[24-Oct-17 09:50 PM] Catiline#0267
they called those people degenerates because humans were slowly _physically_ degenerating from 'the peak European' to lesser beings


[24-Oct-17 09:50 PM] Catiline#0267
mtm is just humouring the fact that people still rattle on about people being degenerates

[05-Nov-17 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I agree, I think it goes with a broad theme of the Kronstadters being poorly controlled, and impulsive, but that they should have been controlled more after the October revolution

One of the issues people have raised is that the sailors involved in the revolution were different to the ones involved in the uprising. That the sailors involved in the uprising were closer to being peasants.

Why should Australians continue to hold a foreign monarch as their head of state? Is it not obvious that an Australian monarchy is a much better alternative? Shouldn't our head of state be a home grown true blue ridgy didge dinky di fair dinkum Aussie?

"Is it not obvious that an Australian monarchy is a much better alternative?"
Whitlam agreed and that's why we have an Australian monarch.

I guess I should re-phrase that question. Does the panel seriously think it is a good idea to make victims of rape - including minors - be forced to carry the baby of their rapist?


[09-Dec-17 06:04 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
be forced to not kill babies? Boy, that is pretty unreasnable...


[09-Dec-17 06:05 PM] djello#5901
not as much as torturing the victims of rape for the rest of their lives

[13-Jan-18 06:39 AM] John Galt#0449
Former Major General Jim Molan and Dr Malcolm Davis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute agree that, in the event of war which cut off shipping lanes to Australia, Australia's fuel reserves would last only 19 days, effectively grounding the Australian Defence Force. As one of the few countries in the world without a strategic fuel reserve, should investment be made in refinement facilities in Australia to head off such an issue?

In the event of our head of state interferes with our democratic process, what should Australia's course of action be? With time and mathematical probability, this *will* happen eventually. Should we wait until then to deal with a constitutional crisis or should we take deliberate and thought-out action as soon as possible?

Q: Dubbed ‚ÄúDay Zero,‚Äù the South African city of Cape Town is expected to run out of water in April of this year. Residents are currently having to comply with strict water usage conditions, while the police and military are preparing to be called in once taps are turned off in April to supervise water collection points. Should the Australian government be providing any support to the South African city of Cape Town?

Q: The commencement of the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang further signals the varying approaches taken to the tension in the Korean peninsula. Kim Jong-un‚Äôs sister, Kim Yo-jong, is in attendance and has invited South Korean president Moon Jae-in to Pyongyang. The two countries entered the opening ceremony under the unification flag, and have a joint women‚Äôs Ice Hockey team competing. All the while, the US continues an aggressive approach, particularly when it comes to employing sanctions. Which approach should Australia ultimately be in favour of when it comes to North Korea?

Today the Centre Alliance claimed on twitter that their refusal to form a government (despite overwhelming public support for their leader) reflected an election promise. When pressed and unable to substantiate this claim, they stated that it stemmed from their agreement with the government which was not part of their platform, and took place after the election had concluded. Do they really believe their supporters voted for backseat drivers?

@everyone, Don't forget to submit your Republican vs Monarchist  Questions tonight!

To the monarchists: why do you hate the global poor?


[03-Mar-18 02:58 PM] Youmaton#1190
To the Republicans: If the Australian public does approve of a republic, which system do you propose we change to? What powers should the president have and how should they be elected?


[03-Mar-18 02:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
To the monarchists: Are you comfortable with the fact that despite Australia being nominally secular, that our head of state is legally required to be Anglican at the moment?


[03-Mar-18 02:58 PM] AnswerMeNow2#5463
To the Republicans: Is there any chance of a fully parliamentary republic being installed, with a Prime Minister as head of state?


[03-Mar-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
To the Monarchists: How does the Monarch provide a sense of stability in an otherwise chaotic political climate?


[03-Mar-18 03:06 PM] iresonl#1084
To the monarchists: How do you justify the nationalistic nature of hereditary monarchy when our head of state doesn't even have a Commonwealth bank-account, and persistently steals from the taxpayers of her own nation? Is this a tradition we wish to associate with?

[03-Mar-18 04:21 PM] Hoog#6115
To the monarchists: how can a secular nation justify having religious requirements for its head of state? 
To the republicans: how can an elected official possibly remain impartial?
To the elective monarchists: how can a system where a head of state rules for life avoid becoming a dictatorship? Could the monarch be removed by parliament in this system?

Submitted Anonymously.

To the panel: Why is/n't change needed?


[03-Mar-18 06:39 PM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
To the Monarchists: As people who I assume classify themselves as "patriotic" Australians who believe in democracy and civil liberties, how do you justify following an undemocratic foreign appointment of an executive that this nation is forced to follow?
Even if ceremonial, wouldnt your ideology would drive you to make roles pertaining to Australian democracy exclusively Australian and Democratic?

To the panel: Sydney is one of the largest cities on earth by total occupied land area but has a comparatively small population to other cities of roughly similar size. When faced with the inevitability of future population growth, is the urban sprawl approach a problem we need to tackle? More broadly, is encouraging higher density and more efficient use of space in previously existing cities like Sydney the way forward or is encouraging the development of other locations into new cities the best course instead?

1) My question is for the entire panel: When in the Labour Party, the Social Democrats supported fully funded free tertiary education for Australian students.

Will the panel consider the amendments soon to be put forward on the "Drugs are cool" bill?


[09-May-19 09:17 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Will the Socialist Party accept support from the SDP in the senate? If so, does this mean all their grandstanding turning the Youmaton Government about the conduct of SDP was meaningless?

It started when Israel fired at "hackers" in Gaza and killed a "Hamas official" in his car.

[25-Jul-19 12:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
The proscribed debate on reddit has been a flop for two obvious reasons: 1) most candidates have no time currently to draw up a bunch of questions and engage with a "debate" over a number of days, they are busy campaigning. The questions should have been set out beforehand. 2) The setting is not actually conducive to a good debate environment.

Thanks for the question, Zak. The Social Democratic Party has governed Australia with a compassionate hand for the past three months, and we look forward to doing so for another three months. We have introduced programs which will improve the lives of students, those who live in poverty, and elderly people, as well as regular Australians right across the country. This government is one that is determined to see Australia grow and prosper, from the far reaches of Alice Springs, to the coastal cities with booming populations. The Australian people understand that now, of all times, it is important to remain united and ensure continuity as a government, which is why I‚Äôm confident that the public will deliver us a further mandate to govern.


[30-Mar-20 11:30 PM] Zak#6496
And what do you say to those who may be considering if voting for the National Liberal Opposition?


[30-Mar-20 11:46 PM] doctor#0002
Good question, Zak. You might be the best journalist I've ever seen. Anyway, the Social Democratic Party believes that all voters can and will be won - we don't focus only on a select few 'swing voters' like the pundits and party advisors tell us. We focus on all Australians, because we know that an SDP government must be one for and by the people - all of the people. We know that the government must take all viewpoints into consideration, including those of National/Liberal voters. To those of you who are leaning towards voting for a different party, I simply say this. We live in a society of divisions, a country of differences, a people of uniqueness. Me and the Social Democratic Party want to heal these visions - we understand that Australians come in all different shapes and sizes, and we want to unite us all as one. We are all Australian, regardless of the identity politics of those in opposition. You don't have to campaign for us, you don't have to put up posters for us, you don't have to knock on doors for us - all you need to do is recognise that Australia can only be improved if we improve it together - and only together. We need you to help us, raise us, lift us up from the ground and tell your friends, even if they oppose us, that they are welcome in our party, in our coalition of love and respect. We are a party of and for all the people, and I hope all Australians recognise that.

So, will you be recontesting your senate seat this election?


[30-Mar-20 11:55 PM] inactive#6974
I most definitely will. I believe in the strong message of the SDP. We have been a strong, active government. I am committed to Australians. As 45% of this national prefer us to any other party, I feel it is my duty to continue to represent Tasmania as a Senator. I have been active, not missing one vote. Since election I have voted on every single vote. This is not something that can be said for any other current senator except jq8678. Explosivo also has a 100% voting record, but hasn't been in the senate that long, still, congratulations to him so far, it's a pleasure working alongside him, but I digress. We can't afford a Nationals/Liberal government. The nationals will destroy this country with their non-existent climate policy and open climate denialism.

The SDP has delivered a strong, progressive budget.


[30-Mar-20 11:56 PM] inactive#6974
We have delivered strong progressive polices, and we hope to continue this in government after this election.


[30-Mar-20 11:58 PM] Zak#6496
The coronavirus crisis is certainly engrained into people‚Äôs minds at the moment. Some have criticised the SDP for its relative inaction, while some say it is too dangerous to have the election go ahead. Can we trust the SDP to protect Australians from the virus?


[31-Mar-20 12:03 AM] inactive#6974
We can. We have seen action from this government with the national bi-partisan cabinet the PM is proposing to be established, the social distancing measures that have been put in. Now is not a time to get bogged down in party politics. I'm not interested in, the SDP isn't interested it in, Australians are interested in it. We are in a pandemic and attacks each other is not going to help, which is why the Leader of the Opposition's motion was amended.


[31-Mar-20 12:03 AM] inactive#6974
The cabinet has a range of economic support in place.


[31-Mar-20 12:06 AM] inactive#6974
And the election campaigning is going to be hard. It's going to be disappointing not be to able to hold rallies with fellow supporters


[31-Mar-20 12:07 AM] Zak#6496
Do you believe the election should go ahead!


[31-Mar-20 12:07 AM] doctor#0002
The coronavirus is a good opportunity to illustrate the differences between this government and the opposition, Zak. The Social Democratic Party has been working very closely with our state and territory counterparts, and we've also been engaging many local governments. We believe in an approach that will grow our economy, and revitalise it from the fall it has inevitably taken. We think that government is in place to stimulate the economy, to stimulate government spending, and to stimulate business spending, which is exactly what our recent policies have done. Meanwhile the opposition believes that we should completely ban all foreign investment. I want to remind the opposition that Australia heavily relies on overseas nations to purchase our goods and services, and that hampering this will make this country's economic recovery even more difficult. So yes, in short, we have a wide range of economic policies in place that are stimulating the economy right now, because we believe that government investment, paired with household and business investment will grow the economy, not banning foreign buyers.

I am so glad to have been the Prime Minister of this term, and it has been so successful. The government delivered the budget to the Australian people, which is absolutely huge, and we also passed many pieces of important legislation to make Australian Society better as a whole. It has been a great term, and as I re-iterate, I am glad to have lead the government this term and I look forward to continuing to campaign for the second term.


[31-Mar-20 09:12 PM] Explosivo2002#5778
Personally, I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone who's only been a member of this government for less than a third of this term. However, looking at what they've achieved both before and during my time, I would argue this had been a brilliant term for the SDP.

We've passed into law one of the most groundbreaking budgets this nation has seen, for which I'd like to congratulate the PM on once again, and have made strides in the fields of both Indigenous Affairs and LGBTIQ+ Affairs, amongst many other great achievements that you can see by looking at our record. So yes, I believe that this has been a successful term, and I hope we can continue our progress following this election.

"Firstly may I thank the Prime Minister for their drink. Secondly, this term has seen a lot of action which I have personally supported and I've made my case perfectly clear on platforms like Twitter. In this budget, I saw good funding mechanisms towards revitalizing rail and infrastructure in this country as well as critically needed reforms and funding in LGBTQ+ and mental health areas. Overall I did approve of the Budget mechanisms despite my disagreement with many parts of it. 

For the Government as a whole, I feel like they implemented a lot of my concrete policies I proposed in my last run for Member of Robertson and they have seen the direct boon and positive effects that my policies could offer. Therefore, I think the term was overall good for Australians as a whole and I hope that good steady leadership continues no matter the party. I think I can get all party members here to agree that we've had enough chaos in politics in our lifetimes eh?"

Well Gregor, I wish there was less chaos in politics, but the truth is politics thrives on chaos, and it won't go away anytime soon considering the COVID-19 crisis facing Australia and the rest of the world.


[31-Mar-20 09:24 PM] Zak#6496

He speaks of unity, but as I've mentioned before on Twitter, the oficial vote is considered as 8-1 in his leadership, out of party room twice that. How can he claim to be lead a united government when over half his party cant even be bothered to support him enough to submit a ballot in a party conference?

Of those who were active in the party, he got numbers similar to that of Saddam. The party is united around its leader. There are many members of the SDP which aren't active too, come the next vote of confidence for their leadership it'll be interesting to see them use my explanation to this issue.

In my eyes, I am normally all for popular sovereignty, but this party seems a bit irrelevant given how the SDP are now. We as a broad tent party still all agree that massive action on climate change is needed, and the formation of the Greens also undermines our idea of the United Left.

However, in putting personal feelings aside and sticking to my philosophy, it is good for the Australian people to have more choices, especially choices that help us avoid electing a government of climate deniers: that being the Nationals and the Liberals.


[31-Mar-20 09:44 PM] ripauntmay#0083

The government did not act swiftly during the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia, as a result of this the lives of australians have been put at risk, the Opposition has held this government to account, we have finally bent it so that it took action, however what we are seeing is too little too late


[31-Mar-20 09:59 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
The Government has proposed a lot of measures I believe were necessary. However, I am worried for our Australian small businesses who I fear have gotten very little support in these times alongside all the Australians who are being left behind under current programmes. There is a massive global headwind for uncertainty and Business confidence reflects that. I think this Government should do more to ensure that we can protect those who will be left behind during this crisis. The elderly, the disabled, small business and migrant communities are all deeply threatened by this and I hope to see the Government take action on that. 

I do agree that there could have been way more done in the early days of this crisis and the priority to get as many Australians back home should have been at the very top of the list. The Government is doing a lot of good work but I'm worried that some of their policies may prove detrimental and their lack of action in some sectors will harm Australia.


[31-Mar-20 10:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

@inactive The Government's measures don't protect the elderly and the disabled who will be left behind. Both communities I have supported a lot in my time as a MP.

China is not a friend or ally of Australia (http://www.xinhuanet.com/2020-03/04/c_1125660473.htm) ‚Äúthe United States would sink into the hell of a novel coronavirus epidemic.‚Äù That is us next. We should protect ourselves from this as the government's number 1 priority. 

Similarly, other countries aren't willing to export medical goods, last week, the Indian government ordered its pharmaceutical companies to stop exporting 26 drug and drug ingredients, most of them antibiotics. And South Korea, Germany, India, Taiwan and others have clamped down on exports of masks and other protective gear over worries that their own supplies will fall short. We should not leave ourselves unprepared from a more deadly Chinese virus in future


[31-Mar-20 10:09 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Hmm, that is good measures then. However, money alone cannot solve the problem that our elderly cannot go to the supermarkets due to major fears of catching the disease.


[31-Mar-20 10:10 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'd love to debate with Slater further, but I must address the National Party


[31-Mar-20 10:10 PM] inactive#6974
Understood.


[31-Mar-20 10:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But wouldn't trying to jumpstart an entire industry in Australia in the middle of the crisis when business confidence is low be a massive inroad by the Government into the market economy?


[31-Mar-20 10:11 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We'd have to practically set up a inefficient plant which would produce it at higher costs and in a lower quantity most likely


[31-Mar-20 10:14 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
The timing question to me really is academic. It just must be done. The governments of the past have been friends of subsidies to more industries than I can count, it seems a strange time to be come a Friedmanite now, a time where our weaknesses are clearest and our hind the most exposed. If we don't act, we will be in an even worse position in the future. The Nationals will act to stop that at all costs because it is what is necessary. If the SDP wont protect Australians and our national security interests, the Nationals will.


[31-Mar-20 10:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yes but I'm not a member of the SDP


[31-Mar-20 10:14 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm saying this as a concerned right-wing libertarian


[31-Mar-20 10:14 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I'm criticising the Government's inaction on this issue


[31-Mar-20 10:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Furthermore, just call it Covid-19 or Coronavirus brother. Asian-Australians already get enough flak and constantly calling it the Chinese Virus can cause real harm to our Asian-Australian communities


[31-Mar-20 10:15 PM] inactive#6974
Hear Hear!


[31-Mar-20 10:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
There's already cases of Asians being beaten, being spit on and being abused in America, France, Italy and all over the world


[31-Mar-20 10:15 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Calling it the Chinese Virus just stokes more fears


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
And that doesn't change the fact that the virus's origin is from China


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It places a blame on a people for a naturally occuring virus


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] Zak#6496
It does seem to be a poor form to be referencing that in this time.


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Again, it's about the CCP, not the people


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Can't the National Party even recognize it causes immense harm to our Asian-American communities


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] ripauntmay#0083
as i stated earlier, and in my letter to the P.M, Australias economy is in a severly weakend form, if the government does not take action to prevent china and foreign multinationals, then we will barely have any assets left, The Nationals do not support the selloff of Australia, for too long have governments stood by whilst nations like China have taken us for granted, that wont happen under my leadership


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I don't see how 'accountability' is a good excuse here


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
It wasn't naturally occuring. The CCP failed to act to stop it and lied to the WHO in the process to do that


[31-Mar-20 10:16 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Calling it the Chinese Virus makes it seem like it's from Chinese people as a whole


[31-Mar-20 10:17 PM] Zak#6496
My13InchDuck that doesn‚Äôt change it from being naturally occurring. Are you suggesting it‚Äôs from a lab?


[31-Mar-20 10:17 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
No, it identifies the country of origin for the virus


[31-Mar-20 10:18 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm not sure that the CCP will suddenly stop their horrible practices because of you calling it the Chinese Virus. All I see is Asian-Australians coming to me and speaking to me about the abuse they have faced in this nation due to Coronavirus and I fear the National Party refuses to even acknowledge how that could be the problem


[31-Mar-20 10:18 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
It to the best of our knowledge isnt from a lab but china lied which created the spread.

On January 14, the World Health Organization (WHO) tried to cam fears of a pandemic by repeating China's claim that coronavirus was not contagious among humans.

And again, it doesn't stop the virus being Chinese


[31-Mar-20 10:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yeah but Chinese referring to both the Chinese Government and Chinese people is too broad a term


[31-Mar-20 10:19 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Just call it Covid-19 instead of dogwhistling brother


[31-Mar-20 10:20 PM] My13InchDuck#1952

*checks notes, standby*


[31-Mar-20 10:20 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm worried that what the National Party is projecting is trying to hold China accountable and acknowledging the country of origin


[31-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
But what is really being heard is that this is the Chinese people's virus


[31-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
That's all I hear from the Asian-American community


[31-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
That people now think of it as the Chinese people's virus because of rhetoric like that


[31-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It appeals to an anti-Asian base


[31-Mar-20 10:21 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I disagree. I've only heard that when it comes from the left or yourself. No one else seems to fall under this misconception


[31-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
What misconception?


[31-Mar-20 10:22 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
That we are endorsing violence against a group of people by labelling a virus accurately. We have been clear, we are labeling it's origin, not blaming the people

The people of Sydney deserve a new and better representative for their views and interests than the status quo. They deserve a voice of independence in Sydney which is placing Sydney values and priorities first ahead of the caucus backrooms of Canberra or the the party structures which cripple meaningful reform. 

Sydney, a city of progress and vision, has had a sitting member of Parliament who has attacked LGBTQ+ Australians, has denied Climate Change as being man-made and has dogwhistled around Coronavirus in a way which has rallied anti-Asian sentiments to their side. The current member has lied openly about my platform and my policies, painting me as the "Open borders only" candidate. 

Sydney deserves something more than someone who will change the truth for their own interests. Sydney deserves a voice which will deliver a good voice for migrants in this country, economic reform to protect small business, reform to support our disabled communities, reform to support our aboriginal communities, reform to public transit and reform to the status quo which stifles Sydney! Forwards to the Future!


[31-Mar-20 10:30 PM] ripauntmay#0083
The National Liberal Coalition is offering a solution to the Problems that Australians are facing, our plan for lowering taxes across the board, our plan to cut the red tape that is stopping businesses from thriving, our plan to deliver cheaper electricty and cheaper fuel, only the Coaltion will fight for Australia and her values, only the Coalition will stick true to traditional family values, only the Coalition will support your right to practice your religion, only the Coalition will deliver a budget that truly benefits Australia and finally only the Coalition will deliver on its promises so on election day, vote 1 National Liberal Coalition, because we must put Australia back on track!

This United Left are a party dedicated to fighting for you, and I am a Senator committed to fighting for everyone in every single aspect. I've voted 100% of the time, I've debated wherever I can, and pledge to continue fighting every day for the people of this nation. I support AusToWork, LGBTIQ+ rights, and not turning a crisis into a game of xenophobia as other tonight have done.

My question goes to the Leader of the Opposition. Does he believe as I do that China must be punished for their actions regarding how they've acted in regards to the WHO, Hong Kong, the creation of islands in the South China Sea, their breaking of international law regarding the South China Sea, spying on us and how they have treated our strategic allies. And if he does, would he support tariffs on all Chinese goods coming into Australia?

My question goes to the Leader of the Opposition. Is he confident that he can lead the SDP to the next election if he will be beaten by me in the preferred PM poll in the coming weeks?

My question goes to to the Leader of the Opposition. Would he and his party support my bill that would require the Parliament allow our defence forces to fight overseas, rather than just at the direction of the PM to the Governor-General?

My question goes to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can he inform the audience on what his Government has done to deserve a second term?
