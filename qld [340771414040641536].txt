[19-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'd call it a bag, although port was often used by the adults


[19-Feb-19 06:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
and it was a 'port rack'


[19-Feb-19 08:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Indeed was reading something today about it and that schoolbags are called port by Queenslanders maybe an older term


[19-Feb-19 08:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
port is common but mostly in the teachers to refer to it


[19-Feb-19 08:54 PM] DirtySaiyan#0464

[21-Feb-19 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
And they aren't really fashionable anymore

Cross body seem to be worn more but usually by drug dealers or teenaged wannabes
