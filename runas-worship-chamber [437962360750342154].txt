[23-Apr-18 10:36 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657

[23-Apr-18 10:36 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I can't believe that worked


[23-Apr-18 10:36 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I just asked him


[23-Apr-18 10:36 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So how many of you fuckers would support making me Queen of Australia


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
me on two provisos

1. I marry you
2. I am called King Consort, not Prince


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
ah fuck wait


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I don't want to have to do ceremonial shit


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
I want to have a normalish life


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
make me Duke of Melbourne


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
at least Earl of Melbourne


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I don't know if I can marry you, I may have to marry a member of Labor to win their support


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
Earl of Melbourne, Duke of Victoria


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
there we go


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
But I will make you Duke of Melbourne


[23-Apr-18 10:37 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

[23-Apr-18 10:39 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I used to think to myself "wow, one day I should angle for PM" but then I realised, no, fuck that, I will be Queen


[23-Apr-18 10:39 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
Why is it that, given CA are further left than Labor and they both have the same number of house seats, you don't pursue them as coalition partners?


[23-Apr-18 10:40 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
@Deleted User hi


[23-Apr-18 10:41 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Apr-18 10:41 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

[23-Apr-18 10:43 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You cannot trust anybody with who self ids as a centrist


[23-Apr-18 10:48 PM] Rat#1042
Why not me as queen?


[23-Apr-18 10:49 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
do you want to marry me and be lesbian queens


[23-Apr-18 10:49 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
You can accept this offer now, or I will destroy you.


[23-Apr-18 10:49 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The race for Queen is a brutal one.


[23-Apr-18 10:49 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
I will show no mercy.


[23-Apr-18 10:50 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
if we had lesbian queens, I bet we could make hoog a monarchist... :runas:

[23-Apr-18 10:50 PM] Rat#1042
i can agree to that compromise


[23-Apr-18 10:51 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Excellent, we will go forward together on this


[23-Apr-18 10:51 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
not to mention that if we had lesbian queens, we'd be first at something for once in our pitiful country's history and we'd make the nordics look bloody archaic by comparison


[23-Apr-18 10:56 PM] Rat#1042
werent there a lot of gay greeks?


[23-Apr-18 11:03 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
yeah


[23-Apr-18 11:03 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
Greeks were gay af


[23-Apr-18 11:04 PM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Ah, so that's why we wouldn't work with them


[24-Apr-18 07:23 AM] waltor#3519
What is this ‚úù


[24-Apr-18 07:49 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Well, we don't really need it for negotiations since unlike everyone else the Pirates actually understand that making a fucking government is the point of an election


[24-Apr-18 07:50 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
So it's become the chat were me and @Rat plan to become Co-Queens


[24-Apr-18 08:35 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
The beginning of this chat is literally AusSim ck2


[24-Apr-18 08:47 AM] Rat#1042
Hahahah


[24-Apr-18 09:00 AM] ChairmanMeeseeks#8399
But seriously, can we reform the Roman empire rather than having just a monarchy?


[24-Apr-18 10:52 AM] TheWhiteFerret#9970
It was made because I asked for it to be made. That's the only reason.


[24-Apr-18 11:45 AM] Rat#1042
Anyway so the Pirate party is asking for all cabinet positions


[24-Apr-18 11:46 AM] Rat#1042
Every single one


[24-Apr-18 11:46 AM] Rat#1042
Even PM and DPM


[24-Apr-18 11:46 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
Ah, I see you know how to negotiate


[24-Apr-18 11:47 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
The Bernie Sanders method, ask for the whole loaf because if you ask for half you only get crumbs


[24-Apr-18 11:47 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
However, we have things we cannot budge on.


[24-Apr-18 11:47 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
1- Bsharri must be PM


[24-Apr-18 11:47 AM] LuSing My Religion#7657
2- JEB!, member of the Socialist Party, must be Treasurer


[24-Apr-18 11:47 AM] Rat#1042
I can agree on point 2


[24-Apr-18 11:48 AM] Youmaton#1190
Ill make a counter deal


[24-Apr-18 11:48 AM] Youmaton#1190
We make CSID Minister for Norfolk Island


[24-Apr-18 11:48 AM] Rat#1042

[24-Apr-18 12:29 PM] TheWhiteFerret#9970

What's happening?


[24-Apr-18 09:20 PM] waltor#3519
Labor is misbehaving


[24-Apr-18 09:20 PM] Rat#1042
Labor are being little shits about trans people


[24-Apr-18 09:21 PM] Rat#1042
Y'know irl one of my good friends is trans and she found out just after she turned 17. It would've been quicker for her to wait until she turned 18 so she could get it rather than go through the courts


[24-Apr-18 09:21 PM] Rat#1042
Kids shouldn't have to subject themselves to that


[24-Apr-18 09:22 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Hoog is disgusting


[24-Apr-18 09:22 PM] Matt Monti#4771
absolutely disgusting


[24-Apr-18 09:25 PM] Rat#1042
I should've pushed for myself to be PM


[24-Apr-18 09:26 PM] Rat#1042
Because I do not have faith that the DPM will protect the rights and freedoms of individuals


[24-Apr-18 09:26 PM] waltor#3519

[10-Aug-18 11:51 PM] Matt Monti#4771
Bellman can you hold a vote for Second Deputy and then resign?


[10-Aug-18 11:52 PM] Youmaton#1190
or hold the vonc if matt still wants that ü§∑


[10-Aug-18 11:54 PM] Matt Monti#4771
just vonc the whole senate as far as I'm concerned


[11-Aug-18 01:41 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I cannot hold any votes, I am not the deputy president.


[11-Aug-18 01:44 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
I declined the nomination.


[11-Aug-18 01:44 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
Idk who roled me as deputy here, but they were wrong to do so.


[11-Aug-18 01:44 AM] BellmanTGM#3331
So, I'm afraid I cannot assist you in this way üò≠


[11-Aug-18 01:45 AM] Youmaton#1190
@BellmanTGM According to Rommel, you declined after the vote was over


[11-Aug-18 01:45 AM] Youmaton#1190
Thus you were elected, if you dont want it you would have to resign

Who art in aus sim
Hallowed be thy brain 

Thy Parliament come
Thy agenda be done
In the House

Give us this day,
Our daily memes
And forgive us our alts
As we forgive those who alt against us

And lead us not in Terra Australis 
But deliver from NSW Sim

Memos nostrum supersubstantialem da nobis hodie;
et dimitte nobis alti nostra,
sicut et nos dimittimus altibus nostris;
et ne inducas nos in Terra Australis;
    sed libera nos a NSW Simo.
