[31-May-19 02:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Wow how don't you get the joke


[31-May-19 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
From the people I knew from Modbury High they were alright so to was the guy on here that went to Modbury.


[31-May-19 06:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
He was a couple years below


[31-May-19 07:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Again you donâ€™t know the new breed of them


[01-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hence why I asked what's the story


[09-Jun-19 11:25 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I too would like to know the story


[08-Nov-19 09:20 AM] waltor#3519
sa and vic channels should be merged


[08-Nov-19 04:47 PM] dead#0701
fuck you


[08-Nov-19 04:47 PM] waltor#3519
um ok


[08-Nov-19 04:47 PM] waltor#3519
if two major contributors to the economy such as the NT and WA get merged then we should too


[08-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
no


[08-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
That's like merging QLD/NSW


[08-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
or merging Trump and Hillary


[08-Nov-19 05:35 PM] Matt Monti#4771
they hate each other


[08-Nov-19 05:45 PM] waltor#3519
There are only cityslicker SA people on this server, therefore SA is the worst state here.


[08-Nov-19 05:45 PM] waltor#3519
And should be merged with RURAL VIC, which has RURAL SHOWSTEALER


[08-Nov-19 05:47 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
how bout we merge CSID with server muted for such terrible ideas


[08-Nov-19 05:49 PM] waltor#3519
i'll kill you


[08-Nov-19 05:49 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
how bout no


[08-Nov-19 05:50 PM] waltor#3519
how about you don't promote a culture of powertripping amongst the mods


[08-Nov-19 05:51 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
how bout we don't make suggestions which would not go down well with the people involved


[08-Nov-19 05:52 PM] waltor#3519
ok true


[08-Nov-19 05:52 PM] waltor#3519
but like that isn't in the realm of an overbearing mod to enforce


[08-Nov-19 05:52 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
who says its overbearing?


[08-Nov-19 05:53 PM] waltor#3519
i'm not breaking any rules by being an asshat in this way


[08-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
"being an asshat"


[08-Nov-19 05:53 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
if you do enough of them its spam


[08-Nov-19 05:53 PM] waltor#3519
i mean i could interpret your passive aggressive server mute comments as being an asshat too


[08-Nov-19 05:53 PM] waltor#3519
everything the mods don't like = spam now


[08-Nov-19 05:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
there are many things i see on here that i don;t like which isn;t spam


[08-Nov-19 05:54 PM] waltor#3519
such as?


[08-Nov-19 05:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I'm sayign if you do enough of the crap suggestions its spam


[08-Nov-19 05:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
we're not near that


[08-Nov-19 05:54 PM] waltor#3519
ok but why bring it up


[08-Nov-19 05:54 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
I was more trying to vocalise my opinion on your idea


[08-Nov-19 05:55 PM] waltor#3519
and you could do that by not insinuating that you'd be prepared to use admin powers to enforce your opinion


[08-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
fair


[08-Nov-19 05:55 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
it was intended to be a joke but it did come off poorly


[08-Nov-19 05:55 PM] waltor#3519
Ok fair

That is normal and good


[08-Nov-19 06:01 PM] waltor#3519
Give him a few more months and he should be psychoactive

That's cool and Campbelltown is one of the good NPL teams in SA


[16-Jan-21 09:20 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
Our qld season kicks off on march 6 but 2 preseason rounds mean it really kicks off feb 6


[16-Jan-21 09:21 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181

[26-Jan-21 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Surely they have preseason matches sooner than 2 weeks out


[26-Jan-21 04:16 PM] Napoleon Freeze#4181
