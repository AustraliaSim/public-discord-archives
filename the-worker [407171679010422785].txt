Good evening everyone.


[13-Apr-18 10:04 PM] Hoog#6115
We regret to inform you that the Australian Labor Party will not be forming majority government, as they are not running enough candidates. Truly a sad day for everyone.


[13-Apr-18 10:06 PM] Hoog#6115
Labor will continue to represent everyday Australians with the seats that they do win.


[13-Apr-18 10:06 PM] Hoog#6115
The likely number is three or four seats.


[13-Apr-18 10:37 PM] Hoog#6115
All you need to do is vote Labor! You can also volunteer to hand out HTV cards and get involved with student politics.

Brilliant showing by the relatively young Australian Labor Party, winning a plurality of the seats before the supplementary elections.


[14-Apr-18 03:12 PM] Hoog#6115
Congratulations to @Hoog, @m_l, @Deleted User, @Matt Monti, and @Harold for winning their seats.


[14-Apr-18 03:12 PM] Hoog#6115
Commiserations to those who lost out.
