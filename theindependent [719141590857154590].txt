G'day Prime Minister and Gregor.


[13-Jun-20 07:05 PM] now, not yet#8743
Let's begin tonight's debate. Each of you may give an opening statement before we move on to the first question.


[13-Jun-20 07:05 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
G'day lads, you down for a round after this?


[13-Jun-20 07:06 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Hello Australia, I appreciate you having me here today. Cause it is you who's put me here today, your consistent support for the Country Labor Party and your belief in an independent and prosperous Australia with a party who's solely dedicated to rural issues for the betterment of the oft-neglected Australians who build this country and make it prosperous and whole. 


Already, as we sit here, we have a mandate which no one else on this stage can boast. In a by-election everyone expected to be a contest between the Government and Opposition became a firm race between those who have taken rural and regional voices for granted and those who have put their interests first. The people of Mayo and all of those strong farming communities in South Australia decided that they were fed up and voted for a party which places them first. A party which acknowledges them and acknowledges their labor and struggle rather than solely acknowledge the big land barons and those who don't truly represent the average working man. 


We won not by promoting the ideal of of a rural strongman like the Prime Minister represents which hides the deep insecurities of their ideology but through acknowledging the status of regional Australia, hearing them and offering practical solutions. Rather than fit a urban manifesto concocted in the halls of Canberra, we offered a platform born from Mayo and approved by no one but our new MP. That is a platform grown by grassroots Australia with the policies coming directly from grassroots Australia.


[13-Jun-20 07:07 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm here today because we clearly see two sides here. The Liberal National Party stand for what they perceive to be rural issues while their entire strategy hedges on who can win the biggest headlines and virtue signalling outrage. The Social Democratic Party sends a few tweets and an indignant letter and then drops the issue. The Australian Democrats are a mess and who else is really offering themselves up practically? If anything, I think only the Country Labor Party, Rommel and some independents are the only ones giving a serious analysis of Australian issues. 


The Country Labor Party is therefore offering itself as a side of proven experience. We've demonstrated our commitment to independence through  convincing me, a stubborn independent, to lead this new movement alongside our continued practical application of our policy to never have a Canberra office. We've been shown to be the only ones taking practical action to protest tyranny when the Social Democratic Party kowtows and accepts the spin of the Liberal National Party. For a party which actually has the balls to stand up for Australia, there's very few better options on the market for you right now


[13-Jun-20 07:09 PM] NGSpy#8096
It is clear that the Liberal National Party just want what is best for corporates and not the people. With their constant revenue and expenditure cuts, and policies that are against the worker like the Ensuring Integrity bill we see in the house, it is clear that the LNP doesn't care about the working class Australian, but on contrast the Social Democratic Party. We care about the msessage that every Australian should be able to fulfill their life to the fullest, with programs that benefit Australians and action on matters that affect those who are often ignored. As the opposition we account the government on their goof-ups to ensure that our electorate's voices are heard. I hope to have a fruitful debate with all the contenders here tonight, and that it will benefit the Australian public watching so that they can learn more about the parties that are here.


[13-Jun-20 07:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
G’day Australia,

As the Prime Minister of Australia, I am immensely proud to be at the helm of such a great country and at the forefront with my strong, United team of qualified Cabinet Ministers. In my time as Prime Minister, Treasurer and in general, voice of the average working class Australian; I have pushed for the issues that matter and will guide us into what I like to call a Golden Era; one focused on fiscal stability, equal opportunity, a job, a future for your children, a beer in your hand and a home to your name.

We’re the only party on this stage that can tout economic responsibility and over the remainder of this term and next term, we will continue pushing pragmatic policies to ensure that quality of life goes up and the burden of taxation and social problems goes down. But that’s to discuss further on in the debate.

I look forward to pushing a strong case to the Australian people tonight as we talk the hot button issues and I’ll be sure to point out why you should re-elect the Griffo Government to another term!


[13-Jun-20 07:12 PM] now, not yet#8743
Thank you all.


[13-Jun-20 07:12 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

Come on people, is that really it? Stump speeches blindly praising the same tired platforms from either side of your house? Come on people, your given the prime opportunities of your lives to stand up in front of Australia and make your issues and stances known and all you give us are stump speeches. Go into the specifics, go into what you've actually done for Australians and talk about your successes. I'm proud that we succeeded in Mayo for instance, I don't think that we'd need to hear another speech from an SDP candidate talking about programs that benefit Australians and hearing those who are ignored when they ignore the voice of regional Australia and we don't need to hear blind praise of your "qualified cabinet ministers" who are taking dumps on Parliamentary desks and co-opting pride month of all things to pass through your own agenda.

I would like to passively aggressively remind the Leader of the Country Labor Party that this is the opening statement that should promote a general message and be snappy. One gets into policy on the debate questions. Can the chair of the debate proceed to debates so that theory can be doinked on realll quick?

Sure thing.


[13-Jun-20 07:17 PM] now, not yet#8743
First question is to all candidates, and it's fairly simple: what puts your party in the best position to form a government after the next election?

Additionally, I'm told that Jayden is being evacuated from the burning Hungry Jack's by Rommel, and may not be able to participate either. Hope they're okay!


[13-Jun-20 07:22 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm not promising to be Prime Minister, I'm promising to deliver policy for the oft-neglected regional and rural Australians. 

That can be achieved in a Liberal National Party Government or a Social Democratic Party Government, I don't care which one it is as long as they're delivering for those who voted for my party. Above all else, we want to strive for independence within Government. 

Cause quite simply look at what has happened in Mayo, the Country Labor Party came out of left-field and defeated our opposition to be elected in the region. Regional Australia wants a party which can represent them well and act as an actual representative for their region rather than a stooge of the party. They want someone down-to-earth with their communities and want someone who can go with either side as long as they come out on top. Voters have identified with out policies on taking action to save farmers, cutting taxes, financing regional and rural education and healthcare, helping tackle regional poverty which very few indexes or indicators really look at and ensuring that regional Australians get a fair go at life whether it's working a 9-5 job in Wagga Wagga or carving out a living on a farm in Lingiari. That is the Country Labor message.


[13-Jun-20 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well I think it’s because we actually care about the electorate. The Liberal National Party is the only party that can actually appeal to every single Australian; the CLP is tied with the regions, the SDP inner cities and minorities, the Greens if they’re still around - environmentalists and so forth. The LNP represents every single Australian in the fact that we have record infrastructure investment, we’re upgrading schools, we’re upgrading hospitals, we’re investing record funding into mental health, we’ve actually brought a drought policy to the table, we’re improving transportation, we’re reducing electricity bills, we’re reducing uncompetitiveness in the economy and we’re slowly loosening our reliance on foreign nations; Australia is once again standing on its own two feet.


[13-Jun-20 07:26 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I take offense that your trying to claim that only the SDP represents minorities but I will accept that we are indeed, tied with regional Australia which makes up how many seats in the House of Representatives? Quite a few, including many seats which you had hoped to win Prime Minister


[13-Jun-20 07:26 PM] NGSpy#8096
The best position to form a government after the next election is always a majority in the house and a majority in the senate! In reality though, the SDP are willing to work with parties that align similarly to ideologies like the Socialist Alternatives and also in regards to some of the policies of the Australian Democrats. It is important that to enforce policy that is for the best interests of the people, that one must be able to work with other parties in order to achieve a better overall policy range that is more beneficial for the people of Australia. I can suggest for the farming sector that we will subsidize fertilisers, pest and weed control and methods to improve soil quality, but another party might have a valid point against how one implements it in order to account for certain mistakes that might be there. Accountability is most important in a government, which is why the SDP would be willing to work with other parties that are similar in ideology in order to ensure better policy decisions.

The SDP encourage a message that says to the people, 'we know your concerns and are willing to take ideas to make those concerns eliminated', and that 'we want to help you improve your quality of life'. That is most important to the Social Democratic Party. We care about the people themselves rather than just legal entities that may gain the system by influencing policy. Whether you are a country person who need farming to be more beneficial for profit or who needs more water to not be wasted, or an inner-city student who need to get on with life, the Social Democratic Party want to hear your issues and want to hear solutions, and figure out the best one for all of the Australian people.

Absolutely, people are coming to the realisation that the SDP don’t actually care about fighting for the people of Australia, they don’t care about how the coronavirus is impacting people financially and they don’t actually have an understanding of what they’re talking about half the time. We’ve seen them delay COVID stimulus funding so they can have a spending spree, we’ve seen them delay and deny nearly $30 billion from being returned to the people of Australia in the form of tax cuts, we’ve seen them deny reducing school tuition fees by at least $5000 per child and we’ve seen them deny nearly $30 billion in crucial infrastructure spending. The Australian people are coming to this realisation and as they do, more and more people will turn to the LNP as a party which truly represents them

While NGSpy is answering I'll ask Gregor his question too


[13-Jun-20 07:37 PM] now, not yet#8743
To Gregor, recently your party had SnecBoi elected as the Member for Mayo in the recent by-election. This could be attributed, particularly with the narrow margin of victory, to a preference deal reached with the Liberal-National Party. Do you see yourselves working with them next term over the SDP?


[13-Jun-20 07:37 PM] NGSpy#8096
In regards to Preferred Prime Minister polling, it is ultimately a prediction on what happens on the day. The people are more influenced by the campaign on a campaign trail rather than the going ons of parliament as it has been consistently shown with government after government, so I feel it would be unfair to answer the question for myself, and I shall wait until the next General Election. It is important to note that I myself wrote the Coronavirus Economic Response Package and included prices that were beneficial to the worker and recommended by unions that protected the worker, and that the prime minister severely downsized the payments from $750 to just $200 in one instant, which is why the stimulus package has been delayed. It shows that the SDP are ready to fight for the people of Australia and promote a better quality of life instead of prancing around with numbers in a global economic crisis. Long story short, the PPM is an indicator of how they are doing in certain conditions. Campaigns are when candidates can express what they wish to do more than in parliament and what they are against, and that is what the voter pays attention to.


[13-Jun-20 07:39 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I don't think the question should be on who we're working with, I think it's a question on how we'll make sure that the people of Mayo didn't waste their vote and to make sure we're representing them. 

Whichever side offers our voters and the voters for the Country Labor Party the best deal will be the side which we will back and support. However, we will stay independent and stay connected to our regional areas and electorates throughout and consult with them about who they'd prefer to see us with.

 Cause questions about which side of the political punch-up we're gonna side with ultimately harms our democracy, the real questions is what we're gonna do while in office, how we will serve Australia and what we will do to achieve our goals.


[13-Jun-20 07:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well when we talk about the Response Package, you need to take into account that we’re reopening Australia successfully and thus the payments are no longer necessary as more Australians come back into the job market. Also, tax cuts as a form of stimulus as well as the state of despair you left our country in in terms of finances needs to be accounted for NGSpy!


[13-Jun-20 07:40 PM] now, not yet#8743
Strong words. Quick response, NG, or shall we continue?


[13-Jun-20 07:42 PM] NGSpy#8096
It will be quick response. Tax cuts aren't direct forms of stimulus: they're indirect and have major consequences for public programs. Australians would be better off in the current state where they are starting up work if the stimulus wasn't slash slash slashed by the LNP at all! Shame on the Prime Minister for degrading the status of citizens of Australia to pawns who go to work!


[13-Jun-20 07:42 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm sorry but just cause a job market is recovering doesn't mean that there is no need for a direct stimulus into the economy


[13-Jun-20 07:42 PM] NGSpy#8096
Hear hear to Gregor!


[13-Jun-20 07:43 PM] NGSpy#8096
I feel as if the chair should continue on...


[13-Jun-20 07:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well we’re the party of sensible economic management. Why should the government of a country whose economy remains strong, where employment, whilst falling, remains nonetheless relatively high compared to other countries, spend more on fiscal situations than nations which are in a far worse position?


[13-Jun-20 07:43 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
In fact, I'd like this time here to talk about a real issue effecting Australians right now if you wouldn't mind


[13-Jun-20 07:43 PM] now, not yet#8743
Moving on then. To all participants, what do you think is the most important policy that you've brought forward in Parliament this term?


[13-Jun-20 07:43 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

Well considering we just entered Parliament, very little. Was The Independent expecting those without Parliamentary representation or those who have recently achieved it to show up with a question like that. Move away from the big parties and move onto what we can achieve for Australians. 

For an answer of sorts though, I'm proud to have been the only party on this stage to stand up to tyranny the moment a Prime Minister thinks they can just frankenstein the results of a plebiscite to suit their needs better.


[13-Jun-20 07:47 PM] NGSpy#8096
We've already talked about the Coronavirus Economic Stimulus Package, so I wish to turn attention to a bill I have co-written with the independent member for Nicholls. It shall be introduced to the senate soon, and hopefully next cycle. It will create an agency to encourage more General Practitioner Accessibility across Australia to eventually get rid of the Rural GP shortage in Australia that the member for Nicholls showstealer1829 has pointed out many times during his tenure as MP.


[13-Jun-20 07:48 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Aye, the Member for Nicholls clearly took the initiative there coming from a regional electorate!


[13-Jun-20 07:49 PM] NGSpy#8096
To inform Gregor, I actually came up with idea and got assistance from the Member for Nicholls because he clearly knew what he was talking about and I wanted approval from the member who moves community commissions to counter the Rural GP problem. It will greatly benefit many of my electorate in Pearce as well!


[13-Jun-20 07:50 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

The most important policy the government has brought to the table is our tax cuts agenda; we have an opposition who has no idea how economics works: at all. The tax cuts policy is simple; we have brought:

A 5% corporate tax cut, in real terms it is 2.5%, reversing the NGSpy tax hikes at the start of the coronavirus. As shown through the extensive research, the corporate tax hikes will encourage investment, increase the GDP and see a growth in employment opportunities and wages.

We have seen a three year, income tax cut plan which will simplify the codes and will give hard earnt wages back to the Australian people, to use as they please especially in a time of crisis, making the cost of living just that little bit easier.

We are removing the GST from electricity as it is a necessary item and as a result will reduce the cost of goods throughout this country as labour costs from electricity supply is removed and will see a 9.1% reduction in electricity bills.

Finally the fourth part of the Tax Cut plan was the reduction and eventual removal of the Luxury Car Tax, a tax which was imposed to preserve our industry - one which is no longer existent and is now simply a burden on competitiveness in the car market.


[13-Jun-20 07:51 PM] NGSpy#8096

Another individual question for each of you, then.


[13-Jun-20 07:51 PM] now, not yet#8743
To Griffo, your government is no stranger to controversy, having come under fire for removing a journalist from the LNP Press Room and using a motion to recognise Pride Month to express support for lowering taxes. Do you feel Australians might see these tactics as 'underhanded'?


[13-Jun-20 07:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now if we want to talk about Rural GPs, I need to point out the hypocrisy of the Opposition Leader who voted against $80 million of funding dedicated to the training, recruitment, retention and teaching of GPs in regional Australia.


[13-Jun-20 07:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don’t see these tactics as underhanded, the journalist from the LNP Press Room was warned on several occasions for his disorderly behaviour and has received the correct punitive measures. The Pride Month motion is a sensible one which notes our pride in all Australians especially in the adversity of the COVID-19 Crisis.

Well I’ve spoken on this and I don’t believe anyone is entitled to an entire month; it’s not their property. I’d also like to point out how they’re the only group in society which are entitled to a month. There is no Asian Month, Jewish Month, Muslim month or Amputee Month. All Australians should be treated equitably and equally. If we’re going to celebrate pride as a government, we should be proud of ALL Australians as I will not be pushing a divisive agenda.

To NGSpy, the Social Democratic Party have been accused of 'virtue signalling', particularly over LGBTQ+ issues, at the expense of focusing on issues such as workers' rights. Is this impression justified, and why?


[13-Jun-20 08:00 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I'm sorry Mr Prime Minister but when my and my husband sat on our couch and saw you try and take away the only thing which could make us feel accepted and united in Australia as a community, that is when you showed that you don't care about the generally accepted status of pride as being a time to celebrate a marginalized community. We already have a day to take pride in being Australian, that is EVERY DAY I LIVE AND BREATHE AS AN AUSTRALIAN. The month is specifically reserved for us to take pride when barely a decade ago we faced open persecution and for much of human history we were strung up in the town square. If you want to represent all Australians, you must take a stance to recognize these communities and why we fight this motion.


[13-Jun-20 08:00 PM] NGSpy#8096
The impression is certainly not justified. We have legislated policies and are actively creating programs that benefit LGBTQ+ people and curb their issues, and we want to focus our energies on the workers of Australia as well. We have instituted policy and reform that has been for the worker, like Senator Slater's Paid Leave to financially compensate those who are impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and have actively gone against policy against the worker like the Ensuring Integrity bill. Virtue-signalling is more of a speciality of the Liberal National Party I would find! Releasing motions that say 'National Pride Month is better than LGBTQ+ Pride Month even though it has no history to it at all' is clearly virtue-signalling.


[13-Jun-20 08:01 PM] now, not yet#8743
Finally, to Gregor. Your party is relatively untested, and despite an excellent showing in the Mayo by-election, the CLP is polling below all other left-wing parties, such as the Socialist Alternative. Are you worried about being seen as untested? What will draw voters to you at the next general election?


[13-Jun-20 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you think that having a month to celebrate over is the only thing that makes you  accepted in Australia, then I highly suggest you’re quite ignorant as homophobia is not prevalent in Australia as it once was.

I'll answer your question in a second Madam Chair but I quite frankly couldn't stomach the rotten decay of a corpse from the 80s coming up to haunt us in these halls today.

Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen


[13-Jun-20 08:02 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Does the discrimination of Aboriginals not occur because Terra Nullius was revoked from law?


[13-Jun-20 08:03 PM] NGSpy#8096
I feel it's important that society be able to express themselves as a person and that efforts to do so shouldn't be quashed. Homophobia, Transphobia and Bigotry still bloody happen through means of micro-aggression and some people deliberately shame people. I also feel it's important that members can be able to submit the bills to the house without interfering BS that is just a virtue-signal instrument.


[13-Jun-20 08:04 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
If your gonna stay silent about an issue effecting so many Ausralians because you don't think its prevelant, this is the exact attitude you and so many parties take towards regional and rural Australia. Thinking that stuff like disinvestment and stagnation in regional Australia doesn't occur like it used to


[13-Jun-20 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I’m not denying that discrimination occurs, I’m simply pointing out that it’s ludicrous to state that the gay community is not accepted in Australia. We have one of, if not the largest Mardi Gras parades in Australia, we have protections within the workplace preventing Australians from being discriminated against when it comes to employment and workplace relations. I think you need to wake back up to reality because it’s not the 1960’s anymore.


[13-Jun-20 08:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
The gay community is widely accepted in Australia, with equal marital rights and so forth.

Also, some statistics that are against the claim that homophobia 'ain't a problem', Prime Minister. 61% of young people experience homophobic abuse and 18% experience physical abuse for being attracted to a different person. It's still a problem and still needs to be curbed mate. Don't negate an issue because the numbers are coming down.


[13-Jun-20 08:06 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
By this logic Domestic Abuse doesn't become a problem because we now have laws against it


[13-Jun-20 08:06 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
and take action to support victims


[13-Jun-20 08:07 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Now, Madam Chair, the Country Labor Party has been tested. We've been tested on the anthem when we stood up and took a stand against the notion of tyranny which the Government quickly tried to spin away from when they successfuly snagged the headline. We've been tested in Mayo where the electorate has given us confidence. We've been tested to work for independence and have been tested to show a commitment to solely the electorate and the people of regional and rural Australia. That is something which connects with voters and lets them know that while there may be one or two bills coming from the Opposition or Government on this topic that the Country Labor Party will consistently deliver


[13-Jun-20 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Can you tell me exactly how having a motion to celebrate an Americanised month, will end homophobia in this country?


[13-Jun-20 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
It won’t because we need to face facts and actually legislate further against it rather than sitting on our hands and passing non-legally binding motions


[13-Jun-20 08:09 PM] now, not yet#8743
I'm sorry, everyone, but we've got to move on.


[13-Jun-20 08:09 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
It's not gonna end homophobia, your trying to strawman our arguments to be something it isn't because quite frankly you can't justify your own stances and viewpoints


[13-Jun-20 08:09 PM] NGSpy#8096
Me and Gregor aren't suggesting that it will end it, we're suggesting that by presenting it you're putting out the fire with gasoline by pleading ignorance to the problem at hand. Ignorance is the greatest tool to those who seek to convince someone of oppression, as is seen in the book 1984. Ignorance is strength to those who wish it. Let's hear what Lily has to say!


[13-Jun-20 08:09 PM] now, not yet#8743
Before we get to closing statements, Gregor, I believe you had a topic you wanted to bring up?

[13-Jun-20 08:11 PM] NGSpy#8096
I highly doubt that you are educated on the topic to make a comment on the real issues that LGBTQ+ people face. You would just appropriate it so that the LNP tax cuts are beneficial for them just like you did with women!

Okay, so celebrating pride month is going to end homophobia in this country. Good to hear. I love how they rant and scream about the LGBT community but never come up with solutions.

[13-Jun-20 08:13 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
For both of you, as you know I am deeply involved in the migrant community and have been heavily involved especially in regional migrant communities and have met those who require on migrants to make their living and survive. Ignoring the rhetoric of some sides which try and turn Australians against our fellow man, let's consider an issue which has oft been neglected in this time. We have people on work visas who's livelihoods in Australia depended on that work stranded with the future of their visa in jeporady. Many of them have become dependent on that work visa and many of them can't find a new form of employment because either their former employer isn't hiring or they've shut down. Due to some of the tenants of the visa agreement, many of them can't find work elsewhere


[13-Jun-20 08:13 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
We've got Australians who are literally dying and starving because of this and I've seen nothing from either of you on this topic


[13-Jun-20 08:13 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
When will we see some action?


[13-Jun-20 08:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well when you provide a solution, I’ll be glad to take it.


[13-Jun-20 08:16 PM] NGSpy#8096
It is important that people be allowed to work for longer as it benefits our economy, and that this country be an open and fair country which benefits those who wantt to work here. This is why we opposed the Visa Caps that the ex-Attorney-General proposed and is why we oppose the draconian and seppo policies that the LNP government want to introduce in order to cause these issues that Gregor talks about. I would be willing to work with the CLP as well on this problem in order to make sure that those who are dying and starving aren't with proper action that takes into consideration their work situation.


[13-Jun-20 08:18 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Your the Government in waiting, why didn't you pick up on this sooner?


[13-Jun-20 08:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well Gregor, this is such a minor issue; I’ve never actually heard of this occurring. Now that this is brought to my attention, I will be glad to look into it further and bring reforms to the table which will provide assistance to hardworking Australian migrants who integrate themselves with our lifestyle and willingly accept the Australian way of life and our values. 

However we must be responsible here and take Australians into account first and foremost. We have a housing crisis in this country, we have a youth unemployment crisis in this country and we have an infrastructure crisis in this country. We are happy to have people immigrate to Australia, however it needs to be at a sensible, sustainable rate in accordance with development of infrastructure and services so that the current strain is lifted. I have always advocated for a sensible quote and rate of immigration to come in as we must not recklessly open up the borders to the detriment of services and infrastructure in this country.


[13-Jun-20 08:19 PM] NGSpy#8096
Because the bloody bill queue is clogged by stupid motions that the LNP wants to virtue-signal. I will get on top of it now though, and also endorse any effort to help in this regard, as Pearce will also be affected by this.

You barely know what it is, how can you make a judgement on how serious of a matter this is.

I'm sorry Prime Minister but if you honestly think that because something is in the minority of cases (fun fact, it isn't) then you've got another thing coming. You've got Australians barely feeding their families and there's something we can do about it. Your not doing anything about it, your trying to turn the topic

Well that completely contradicts with the issue at hand here, which is exactly my point. Why make the problem worse by opening up the gates as you’ve proposed when the system is currently broken? It is far better to restrict immigration temporarily as we fix immigration related issues currently before moving in and opening up increased migration opportunities again

My closing statement is simple, Madam Chair, it's clear throughout this debate that the Social Democratic Party continue their streak of ignoring the real issues and have failed in so many accounts while the Liberal National Party have proven themselves dead heartless in the affairs of LGBTQ+ Australians and in the affairs of migrant Australians. 

The Country Labor Party is the party which is going up, the party which is making them both afraid. A party which can actually represent the interests of regional and rural Australia and which is actively doing so. Mayo has placed its confidence in the Country Labor Party and you can too!

The fact only three parties showed up to this debate is quite telling in a way, quite telling that only the two major parties came to have a political fist fight while the others have refused to face the national spotlight. Meanwhile, in the CLP, we are proud of our achievements and our fight. 

We will be looking forward to the legislation we implement ahead, I hope that you will see that and see the CLP is the party offering itself to you to hold the bastards in Canberra accountable and hold your views first

[13-Jun-20 08:33 PM] NGSpy#8096
It is clear that the Liberal National Party doesn't give a bundle of crap to those who need the most assistance in Australia, from focusing on nativist and nationalist policies, to re-purposing Pride Month as an opportunity for LNP to block up legislation and promote their own agenda. It is absolutely abhorrent, disgusting, and weak of them to do so. The Liberal National Party just wish to bow down and suck on their corporate masters, which only wants profit, not the benefit of the people. The Social Democratic Party is willing to sort out issues that affect people that are in the minority and are neglected, while the Liberal National Party only care about the economy instead of a combination of the people and the economy. The Social Democratic Party, as seen tonight, are willing to work with other parties in order to solve issues that face Australians and promote more accountability. This was an interesting debate to the one last night, and I was glad to see the CLP show their face.


[13-Jun-20 08:33 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yes, because I think that we shouldn't try and hide from our Pacific neighbours. I think the main thing right now is that you realized your being called out over letting Australians starve and your trying as hard as you can to push the subject away from the failings of your own arguments.


[13-Jun-20 08:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Australia, the Griffo Government is one which will ensure that all Australians are treated equally and are given the same opportunities in education, energy, employment, health and defence. You have seen how the left act when it comes to problems in this country; they talk about issues, then scream up and down about them when you wrap your head about what on earth they’re talking about. And then once that’s all done and dusted, they haven’t proposed a single solution to the problem at all which will actively solve the problem. We know NGSpy is a floppy wet piece of cabbage and cannot crunch when it comes to the numbers. We know the SDP don’t care about the Australian people when they want to see them go further into poverty in a time of financial crisis, by keeping stimulus in limbo and voting down essential investment into this country. We need people with pragmatic solutions, we need people with sensible policies and we need people who can represent all Australians, some who can fight for the many and not the few! Only the Liberal-National Party can see economic prosperity in this nation and it is your obligation to re-elect the Griffo Government at the next election!

**Breaking News -- Government announces plans to proscribe 'antifa' as terrorist organisation**


[15-Jun-20 02:45 PM] now, not yet#8743
The governing Liberal-National Party made waves Monday afternoon after it was announced that they were moving forward with plans to proscribe 'antifa' as a terrorist organisation.


[15-Jun-20 02:46 PM] now, not yet#8743
The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and former Prime Minister, Riley8583, announced on Twitter this afternoon that "Anyone affiliated with terrorist group like Antifa will not be allowed into the country post COVID-19."


[15-Jun-20 02:46 PM] now, not yet#8743
In the ensuing reaction, former Attorney General My13InchDuck drew controversy by responding to a tweet in Arabic by describing the language as "bomb wire". The Prime Minister later said he would caution the cabinet minister.

*A broadcast begins on social media from The Independent.*

Hello everyone, my name is Olivia Jones and I'm the Independent's political editor based out of Birmingham UK. Anna Hiles is otherwise occupied tonight and I'm standing in for our final report on the Australian General Election before the polls open. The campaign in Australia has been a long one, and as the campaign officially closes and the polls prepare to be opened the Independent is releasing final predictions for every electorate. These may differ from other prominent predictions, but they are based on an analysis by many of our political editors. Please enjoy.


[03-Jul-20 08:06 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Pearce**

First up we have the electorate of Pearce. In this seat we have seen Minister of Defence RMSteve go up against the Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Social Democrats NGSpy, the incumbent for the seat. The LNP candidate has fought hard, but it seems like this seat will not be flipping tonight. We expect the seat may become slightly more marginal, but it is doubtful that it will flip. 

SDP HOLD


[03-Jul-20 08:08 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Mayo**

Next up we have Mayo. This seat will be having its second election in a short period of time, after the by-election triggered by the resignation of prominent SDP politician MattMonti. In the by-election we saw just how left this seat leans, with the CLP and SDP making up a massive share of the vote and the CLP pulling ahead. This GE, the two parties have put aside their differences and the SDP has endorsed incumbent SnecBoi. We do not expect the LNP to make a dent in the centre left’s grip on this electorate, and as such SnecBoi will be returning to Parliament after the 4th.

CLP HOLD


[03-Jul-20 08:09 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Lingiari**

Lingiari has seen a fight between the LNP’s Walter_heisenberg2 and an Independent named DirtySaiyan. Unfortunately a lack of the hardcore campaign needed to take this seat for Saiyan means we are expecting a firm LNP victory in Lingiari.

LNP HOLD


[03-Jul-20 08:10 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Capricornia**

In this seat we have seen a faceoff between the former LNP Prime Minister and prominent Social Democrat ARichTeaBiscuit, along with what seems like a paper candidacy from CLP’s Lady_Aya. For a bit it seemed like an easy seat to call for the LNP, however a sudden massive surge in a recent poll has thrown that into doubt. We’re going to call this an LNP lean, but it really could go either way depending on how the two front-running candidates play their cards.

LNP LEAN


[03-Jul-20 08:11 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Moncrieff**

In Moncrieff we have seen a fight between the LNP’s own My13InchDuck and TheGoatBoy2. Polls do not look good in Goat’s favour, and we think there is little to say other than this being a likely LNP safe hold.

LNP HOLD


[03-Jul-20 08:11 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Brisbane**

Brisbane has seen a faceoff between the Social Democrat Flarelia and PineappleCrusher_ from the LibNats. This seat was held by the Australian Democrat MP Zak6858 previously, which means it really could either way. We think the LNP may be pulling ahead in this seat, however given the Social Democrats high national polling it really could go either way. Pending election results, however, we’re putting this down as an LNP lean.

LNP LEAN


[03-Jul-20 08:12 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Cowper**

Now for a very interesting seat, a game of preferences is what will decide Cowper. This election, the Opposition will be counting on their candidate to keep up the pace and for the minor parties to keep the preferences flowing in. One thing is certain, though, the Prime Minister losing his electorate would certainly throw a spanner in the works for a Liberal National return to Government. This is a tossup, but we think it leans to the Social Democrats based on analysis of the preferences.

SDP LEAN


[03-Jul-20 08:13 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Robertson**

Initially what looked like a win for the Liberal National Party has turned into a close election leaning to the AusDem candidate, Jayden. Endorsements from multiple parties and a strong campaign mean the Deputy Prime Minister may be in trouble, as the Australian Democrats have soaked up the left wing vote on top of their usual centrists. We’re expecting a flip in this seat, but it’s still fairly close so this is a seat to watch.

ADP LEAN


[03-Jul-20 08:13 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Sydney**

This seat sees a faceoff between the LNP candidate Mccri, the Independent GeneralRommel, and the Socialist Alternative candidate atamanbatko. Rommel has received endorsements from virtually every single other party, and preferences from the Socialist Alternative, so we think it’s fairly safe to say that Rommel will take the seat; especially without the former Prime Minister there to keep the name recognition that was swinging the seat to the Liberals. Some polls have even had Rommel winning on first preferences.

INDEPENDENT GAIN


[03-Jul-20 08:14 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Cunningham**

Recent events have thrown the Cunningham campaign from a certain Lib-Nat hold into an almost uncallable toss-up. An endorsement of the Socialist candidate by the SDP and CLP, the AusDem candidate suddenly firing into action, and a relatively small amount of campaigning from the incumbent mean that it could go any way. The assumption is that the initially high-polling Liberal National MP will hold the seat, however these new factors long with the endorsement of the SAlt candidate by the SDP and CLP, and preferencing of the SAlt candidate by the AusDems, mean this really is too close to call.

TOO CLOSE TO CALL


[03-Jul-20 08:15 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Canberra**

A seat that the SDP has been toiling over for a while now may just be in their grasp. Recent polls reveal that the popularity of Youmaton is growing steadily, with a focused and expansive campaign from the candidate. The LNP, however, is toiling behind. A last minute surge from the LNP would give them the seat, but without it my money is on Canberra flipping to the SocDems. 

SDP LEAN


[03-Jul-20 08:16 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Nicholls**

This seat initially saw a three horse race, but now that Showstealer (the Independent incumbent) has dropped out, it is now a two horse race between the colourful West Wimmera nationalist EdenHopeStan and the LNP candidate HorrorHQ. We’re saying this is an LNP lean, but we have no idea where the votes from Showstealer will go so this is a seat to watch.

LNP LEAN


[03-Jul-20 08:17 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Melbourne**

The incumbent NeatSaucer won the seat via by-election last term, and the LNP’s UrqartTarkin is challenging them this election. Despite close polling, throughout the campaign, the SDP has put a lot into this seat and we don’t expect the primarily urban electorate to flip to the Liberals any time soon. We predict an SDP hold.

SDP HOLD


[03-Jul-20 08:17 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Hotham**

This seat sees a three horse race between Umatbru of the LNP, Polteaghost of the SDP, and Deladi0 of the ADP. The LNP is in the lead by 5% in this vision, however this seems like a seat that could see a challenge. The ADP haven’t preferenced either party, which means if the SDP can pull into the lead in the first preferences then the seat could flip. However it would require a large surge, so we’re putting this down as an LNP lean.

LNP LEAN


[03-Jul-20 08:18 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Denison**

And for our final seat. Early into the campaign this seat seemed fairly marginal, though without a substantial campaign from the LNP in the later stages we think the incumbent Dyliam will comfortably hold onto his place in the House of Representatives and his electorate. Little short of a last minute surge could take this seat for the LNP.

INDEPENDENT HOLD


[03-Jul-20 08:24 PM] Komrade Kate#1908
**Let's Review**

Looks to be an interesting night for Australia, if the polls and predictions are to be believed. Based on these reports, the House of Representatives would look like this:

LNP - 6
SDP - 4
IND - 2
ADP - 1
CLP - 1
TOSSUP - 1

This polling contains a lot of seats that could potentially flip either way. The best case scenario for the LNP here is a potential majority of the 15 seat house. The best case scenario for the SDP is flipping the extremely marginal Brisbane and Capricornia seats and getting themselves into a position of Government. The SDP's victory relies a lot on these marginal electorates, and whichever way Cunningham goes as they will need partners to secure an NGSpy premiership.

One thing is certain, despite most predictions looking good for the LNP, their re-election is on incredibly thin ice and it would only take one upset victory to topple the Griffo administration. Ultimately predictions don't do justice to what can happen on election night, and the only thing we can do is wait for the results. 

Olivia Jones, signing off.

The Mayo By-Election is set to be a close race. Today there was a surprise campaign announcement from @Deleted User , announcing that she will be contesting Mayo to provide an anti-establishment vote.


[23-Jul-20 04:20 PM] inactive#6974
It is then unsurprising that both major parties opted to sit on the fence, as EdenHopeStan's preferences may decide the next MP for Mayo, and they wouldn't want to rule out a preference deal.


[23-Jul-20 04:22 PM] inactive#6974
So, to wrap it up, the CLP is the only party currently in support of statehood for West Wimmera, with the other parties choosing to sit on the fence.

It is truly too close to call in terms of who comes ahead here.


[25-Jul-20 05:40 PM] inactive#6974
Historically, the AusDems preferences aid the LNP more than any other party, and we don't see why that would change. The higher the first preferencing count from the AusDems, the more chance they have in securing the LNP the seat.

{Reactions}
enlightening (3) 

[31-Jul-20 02:33 PM] now, not yet#8743
It's a story of a man named AussieConservative, a man who was the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Cowper, a Senator.


[31-Jul-20 02:33 PM] now, not yet#8743
Griffo was spilled from the leadership of the Liberal-National Party by the man he succeeded, riley8583, and the ambitious figure of Winston_Wilhelmus.


[31-Jul-20 02:34 PM] now, not yet#8743
The by-election in Mayo spelled the death knell for his leadership, but the story of the LNP's fall begins earlier: before the last general election.


[31-Jul-20 02:35 PM] now, not yet#8743
The last election didn't go well for the LNP: the Social Democrats under NGSpy won a convincing victory, and the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister both lost their seats. Anger in the party flared, and the Deputy Leader of the LNP, Winston_Wilhelmus, pointed the finger at two men: one of them was Griffo.


[31-Jul-20 02:35 PM] now, not yet#8743
The other was PineappleCrusher_, then the Party President.


[31-Jul-20 02:36 PM] now, not yet#8743
In a heated message to the party membership, Winston said that he would be "making it clear to the Party President [PineappleCrusher_] and the Party Leader [AussieConservative] that the continued position of the Party President is untenable."


[31-Jul-20 02:37 PM] now, not yet#8743
His sights were set on PineappleCrusher_ - the man he's about to install as the leader of his party. So what changed?


[31-Jul-20 02:38 PM] now, not yet#8743
When I asked Mr Crusher himself, he wasn't keen to speculate, saying "It would be prudent to ask Mr Wilhelmus, rather than me, that question to have an appropriate, factual answer. However, I have been close friends with Winston for a long time and look forward to his eventual return to Canberra."


[31-Jul-20 02:38 PM] now, not yet#8743
So ask Winston I did, and his answer struck me as a bit odd, to say the least.


[31-Jul-20 02:38 PM] now, not yet#8743
> I believed that PineappleCrusher's destiny lay with the Leadership, not with the Presidency at the time, his position was untenable, and he made the mature decision and promptly switched course.


[31-Jul-20 02:39 PM] now, not yet#8743
An odd choice of words if Mr Crusher's position was 'untenable' and he was meant to run for the leadership instead - but in the absence of any other sources, we're left to take Mr Wilhelmus' word on the issue.


[31-Jul-20 02:40 PM] now, not yet#8743
When I pressed him, he remarked that Griffo himself had said that his leadership was coming to an end. He then provided me with this screenshot.

[31-Jul-20 02:40 PM] now, not yet#8743
It would appear Griffo intended to resign after the Mayo by-election if the result was poor - which, given MattMonti is the current Member for Mayo, it arguably was for the LNP.


[31-Jul-20 02:41 PM] now, not yet#8743
But if he intended to resign, what purpose would spilling him fulfil?


[31-Jul-20 02:41 PM] now, not yet#8743
I asked Winston.


[31-Jul-20 02:41 PM] now, not yet#8743
> He went back on his promise to the Party, he failed to maintain appropriate communications with the Party, and there were so many boxes he left unchecked that an adequate Leader would have checked.


[31-Jul-20 02:42 PM] now, not yet#8743
Given that he apparently 'went back on his promise', I assumed that he'd un-resigned, but my assumption was wrong. Winston informed me that Griffo had made no further communication on the issue.

🍵 

[31-Jul-20 02:43 PM] now, not yet#8743
In my discussions with Winston and PineappleCrusher, they both made reference to a lack of communication from the Leader. Winston specifically mentioned 'lone-wolf' endorsement deals, which he attributed to the LNP's ultimate election failure.


[31-Jul-20 02:44 PM] now, not yet#8743
> **LILY HAIL:** So do you think it's fair to put all of the blame on Griffo for the setbacks the party's faced at the general election and the Mayo by-election?
> **WINSTON_WILHELMUS:** Absolutely.


[31-Jul-20 02:44 PM] now, not yet#8743
But the claims of 'lone-wolf' negotiations simply don't stack up.


[31-Jul-20 02:46 PM] now, not yet#8743
The *Independent* has obtained chat logs of internal LNP chats, and there appear to be numerous instances of Griffo detailing the negotiations he was undertaking.

[31-Jul-20 02:50 PM] now, not yet#8743
In the aftermath of the messy divorce from his former party, Griffo has lambasted the LNP for inactivity - using language such as 'lazy bastards' and 'the most useless vegetables I’ve ever seen'.


[31-Jul-20 02:50 PM] now, not yet#8743
But it doesn't appear to be from a lack of trying on Griffo's part.

[31-Jul-20 02:51 PM] now, not yet#8743
However, PineappleCrusher_ claims that Griffo simply did not go far enough.


[31-Jul-20 02:51 PM] now, not yet#8743
> **PINEAPPLECRUSHER_:** I disavow the word choices of Mr Conservative, and suggest that he uses more proper, appropriate vocab in the future.
> AussieConservative was given numerous chances to turn around the fortune of the LNP. The former Leader of the Opposition, himself, even said that he will step down as leader if Winston lost Mayo and if the LNP were to fall behind in the polls further. Winston lost Mayo and the writing was on the wall for the polling component.


[31-Jul-20 02:53 PM] now, not yet#8743
Following the leadership spill, many left the party. TheAudibleAsh went to the Social Democrats, superpacman04 to the Australian Democrats. Griffo himself is said to be starting a United Australia Party. However, the defections don't concern the new leader much.


[31-Jul-20 02:53 PM] now, not yet#8743
> **PINEAPPLECRUSHER_:** Regarding the exodus, let me be clear: this is a concerted attempt from the cronies of AussieConservative to destabilise the LNP; his last bit of bite before his inevitable irrelevance. It won't work, and the vast majority of members who have left have been inactive in recent times. 63.6% of the LNP voted against the continuation of AussieConservative's leadership; that is a clear mandate against him, and points towards the fact that the Opposition is strong and united.


[31-Jul-20 02:54 PM] now, not yet#8743
Winston_Wilhelmus was also critical of Griffo's leadership style.


[31-Jul-20 02:55 PM] now, not yet#8743
> **WINSTON_WILHELMUS:** He [AussieConservative] pursued Lone wolf negotiations, continuously failed to make things known or seek advice on things he should have through the appropriate channels, he was generally uninspiring, he failed to support Candidates in their electorates, especially in the by-election, to an adequate extent, he would work the Party as if it were some object in his possession, rather than working with the Party. His ego led to his downfall, and after betrayal after betrayal of the Party like we were some pet, the Party snapped back with the appropriate measure.

It's clear the question of who's ultimately to blame for the loss at the general election will continue to be hotly debated amongst the right wing for some time to come. But the question now for the LNP needs to be how they intend to bounce back, given that the SDP has a commanding lead in the polls, and no LNP politician has managed to break 5% in preferred Prime Minister polling.


[31-Jul-20 02:59 PM] now, not yet#8743
PineappleCrusher_ acknowledges the challenges the party faces, but doesn't think that their troubles can be put down to the leadership spill - he says their troubles precede it.


[31-Jul-20 02:59 PM] now, not yet#8743
> **PINEAPPLECRUSHER_:** The LNP knows it has work cut out for them, but it was in such a situation prior to the dismissal of AussieConservative. On an internal basis, the LNP was a machine without its controller; there was no communication, no suggestion on how to operate, and a lack teamwork from the top. In the coming week, I will implement measures to repair such deficiencies - to provide the groundwork for a grassroots collaboration with Australians, to highlight the disastrous policies suggested under the government of the Prime Minister, and to return to fundamentals. This will put us back on track.


[31-Jul-20 02:59 PM] now, not yet#8743
I pressed Mr Crusher for more specifics as to what he'd improve.


[31-Jul-20 03:00 PM] now, not yet#8743
> **LILY HAIL:** Do you have any such measures ready to implement that you'd like to share?
> **PINEAPPLECRUSHER_:** Under AussieConservative, Members of Parliament had no idea what the Opposition's stance was on certain proposed legislation. I will be reversing that with comprehensive information for each item in the coming hours.


[31-Jul-20 03:02 PM] now, not yet#8743
It's been a week full of intrigue and backroom plotting in the LNP, and as the dust settles it appears that AussieConservative's the loser and PineappleCrusher_ and Winston\_Wilhelmus the winners.


[31-Jul-20 03:03 PM] now, not yet#8743
But as this poorly aged image shows, it's impossible to predict what the future will hold in Australian politics.

Now, first up, was it a surprise to see this bill pass the senate?


[13-Aug-20 08:42 PM] inactive#6974
Many parliamentarians have been publicily critiziing this idea, with MPs like My13InchDuck and MattMonti saying "There is no case for West Wimmera to become a state, there never has been and there never will."


[13-Aug-20 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well, to a degree, I was surprised. I contacted a lot of Senators, and the numbers certainly looked better, but it passing was never an assured thing. I'm very happy that we managed to do this. I'm aware of MPs criticism- you've seen me address them, most likely, but I think that there are a lot of lower house MPs who support this bill, too.


[13-Aug-20 08:49 PM] inactive#6974
Do you have the confidence that West Wimmera Statehood will have the approval of the people of Victoria and their Parliament, as is constitutionally required?

@Deleted User from @My13InchDuck in twitter, 
Cowes, the 50th smallest suburb in Victoria has 4,944 people in it. 50% larger than WW. It is regional, including its own island in fact. It's not small, 13.1 km2 and has its own unique identity. Will they be the next suburb in Victoria to become their own new state?


[13-Aug-20 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
If the people of Cowes and the people of Phillip Island want statehood, who am I to say no? Phillip Island definitely has a unique identity, and was screwed over by Kennett in the amalgamations like so many- so sure, why not? It's their choice really.


[13-Aug-20 08:56 PM] inactive#6974

[13-Aug-20 08:58 PM] inactive#6974
Now, @My13InchDuck , wouldn't the best way to quash West Wimmera Statehood, just to hold a vote on it?


[13-Aug-20 09:01 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
The vote would undoubtedly fail. It won't even make it out of the House. My prediction is 14 votes against it and not one for it. My immigration policy got greater support for context. 

What we have to understand is that a vote is more than just a vote. It grants legitimacy to the illegitimate. I wouldn't support a vote on a number of things, not because they'd fail anyway, but because they shouldn't be given to the people because firstly, the Parliament should be wise enough to stop it before it got to that stage and secondly because it allows the debate to move from opposition to a thing to allowing it, at least, an air of legitimacy which it never had before. This cannot go to the people because of these reasons and more. This is a simply stupid idea which has had its day in the Senate and will fail in the House.


[13-Aug-20 09:03 PM] inactive#6974
If the vote would fail, just let it? It would give you an additional democratic mandate wouldn't it?


[13-Aug-20 09:03 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
Again, no. I'll answer this with a question, would you support a vote to the people on the question of brining back the WAP?


[13-Aug-20 09:04 PM] inactive#6974
I have no opinion on the matter


[13-Aug-20 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Duck, I would be very careful with using the acronym "WAP" in these days and times.


[13-Aug-20 09:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
And additionally, how dare you compare West Wimmera statehood to creating a white ethnostate? This is just whataboutism.


[13-Aug-20 09:07 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
The reason you would say no is beacuse it allows a debate on an issue which has already been resolved. Similarly, there is no debate on this issue so it is resolved. The proposed state has no need to exist. It is the 5th biggest electorate in the State, yet only has <4,000 people. If they get representation before the ACT lets say, you're going to see every electorate vote in favour of giving themselves statehood and we will no longer have 6 states but 6 thousand. This is clear and the people of Australia see this as an issue. There is no issue with our current number of states and there is something to be said in regards to the number of people in WW. <4000 is less than you can find in some high rises now. This is nonsense and the people of Australia see this.

[13-Aug-20 09:09 PM] inactive#6974
@My13InchDuck The 45% of people of Nicholls voted for a West Wimmera Statehood candidate, doesn't that show support for West Wimmera Statehood?


[13-Aug-20 09:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is very contradictory. You're saying first that it's nonsense and Australia doesn't want it, then if it passes every man and his dog will want statehood. If the entirety of Victoria and their Parliament and West Wimmera want West Wimmera statehood, clearly there is a demand for it, and very clearly we need to have a conversation about what Australia's governmental structure needs to look like.


[13-Aug-20 09:11 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
<.5% of the country supports this policy. It doesn't matter if the whole WW wants it, they shouldn't get it because its prima facie stupid. This doesn't achieve anything of value at all. This just a politician making a name for themselves and humouring poor Wimmerians in the process.


[13-Aug-20 09:11 PM] inactive#6974
@Deleted User To you, how does West Wimmera have the economic support for Statehood?


[13-Aug-20 09:12 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
My larger point with your policy is that it has no limiting principle. If WW can become a state, why not every other single state electorate become one too?


[13-Aug-20 09:13 PM] inactive#6974
And then some final comments, because I gotta attend to *checks notes* important journalism business


[13-Aug-20 09:14 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
I'll keep it short. This is stupid idea and it will establish a precedent that will be felt in every single state electorate. To stop that we have to deracinate the idea. Opposing WW statehood is more than just opposing this statehood, it's opposing every future statehood on these grounds.


[13-Aug-20 09:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why oppose every future statehood? Why stop every suburb from being a state if they want it? What argument is there beyond it's small?


[13-Aug-20 09:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think if every LGA votes for statehood we'll need a hell of a conversation to have about what states are supposed to look like, but if they want it, why stop them?


[13-Aug-20 09:16 PM] My13InchDuck#1952
> Why oppose every future statehood? Why stop every suburb from being a state if they want it? What argument is there beyond it's small?

I am encouraging Australians across the country to write to your local MPs and tell them to support democracy in West Wimmera and let them have a vote. Letting this fail will be a dangerous precedent for local democracy, and will lead to more politicians thinking they can get away with whatever.
