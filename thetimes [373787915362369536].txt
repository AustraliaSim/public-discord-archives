According to our telephone polling, the Bellman United Party is ahead on 15%, with the incumbent government with 8%, One Nation on 8%, the Liberal Democrats on 8%, the Socialists on 8%, the Greens on 15% and the Labour Party on 15%. 23% of responses were "other".


[28-Oct-17 10:22 PM] PineappleCrusher_#3244
This shows that the incumbent government seems to have lost its momentum, and that the Bellman United Party is picking up steam

Thank you Pineapple, if re-elected, the @deleted-role will get straight to work re-introducing the Gambling Advertising Restrictions Bill, Housing Vacancy Bill, and hopefully the Greyhound Racing Prohibition Bill. We also aim to consult with the people of AustraliaSim as much as possible, and ensure that we work for hard-working Australians. From here, we'll introduce our other measures such as a price on carbon, improved public transport, and replacing stamp duty with a land tax.

I first want to address a few things @djello has brought up


[31-Oct-17 08:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
I find it very interesting that he says he commits to working for all hard-working Austraians. But apparenty that doesn't include the greyhound racers in this society. Apparently coal miners do not work hard enough. Because in the very next statement, he commits to destroying their enterprises and employment.


[31-Oct-17 08:14 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
In our first month in office, however, the Bellman United Party will commit to ppushing for an additional month in every term forwar, so the Australian people can have the efficient government it deserves. We will also be pushing to lower taxes, and working towards bringing more liberties into the lives of ordinary, individual Australian citizens. Furthermore, we intend to push to legalise cannabis, to give adult Australians the ability to make their own choices. At the end of the day, liberty is what this party is all about. And fighting for the liberties of the citizens of AustraliaSim stretches far beyond just the first month of term. It stretches beyond this term. It stretches beyond the next. It stretches. Into. Eternity. ‚úù

The Leader of the BUP suggests that the @deleted-role are against workers, particularly in the mining industry. This is simply untrue. The Dems are the only party in this country that represents workers and fights for their rights. We've established programs which will help assist working Australians, such as the GIMP manufacturing fund and the Regional Tourism Fund which will ensure a seamless transition from areas affected by mining into other industries. The only party that stands for the working class is the @deleted-role .

[31-Oct-17 08:38 PM] djello#5901
Our party is highly committed to the Greyhound Racing Prohibition Bill. Unfortunately the industry is riddled with corruption and outright animal abuse. We believe the only logical option to be take is to wind down the industry. We'll assist workers in the industry find employment elsewhere, and we acknowledge that many of these people will reside in regional areas. My government is dedicated to boosting emplyoment in regional Australia, through policies such as our $300million GIMP manufacturing fund, and our proposal to better-connect metropolitan areas to regional areas.

[31-Oct-17 08:40 PM] BellmanTGM#3331
Greyhound racing is a viabe industry. It is a viabe sport. If you want to ban greyhounds, you have to ban horse racing, and heaven knows the @deleted-role wouldn't for one second *think* about that. See, this policy is a tactic to get support off of the hateful left, who hate working class Australians and their leisure activities. I'd be willing to bet @djello has never even been to a greyhound track, let alone a race. It's not animal cruelty. These dogs are housed, fed, trained, better than any other dog, I'm sure, because not only do these animals give love, they bring income. And *of course* some owners treat their pups badly. But some doctors treat their patients badly. Let's just ban medicine. At the end of the day, greyhound racing is a staple of rural Australian culture, which @djello understands nothing about, and to have government take that away from these people would be an absolute atrocity. Fight for you rights. I know I will. Vote @deleted-role

[31-Oct-17 08:48 PM] leaskie_leaskie#9989
The Socialist Party is staunchly opposed to greyhound racing, but much like @deleted-role we also believe in workers' rights and futures. The vile mistreatement of greyhounds is intolerable and reprehensible, but so would the conditions for workers be if we chose to simply cut them off. The Socialists thus support a dual plan, combining the best elements of both arguments; we believe that greyhound racing is inhumane and vulgar and *will be banned* in our first month, but we also will provide guaranteed jobs and strong reemployment plans for former workers. We won't abandon anyone on this issue.

Thank you Pineapple. The @deleted-role are very focused on providing transport solutions for the 21st century. We support investing in public transport, building new lines and increasing frequencies of highly utilised services. We will connect regional and metropolitan Australia, making it easier and quicker to travel further. This will also assist in creating job opportunities in both regional and metropolitan areas. We will fund increasing transport (especially rail) to airports across Australia, and we'll introduce an Independent Infrastructure Bank to provide funding to local infrastructure projects.

As I have said on several occassions. The government are terrible at pretty much everything they do and have done. So the first step in improving PT is getting government to step back. The government are the closest thing to a monopoly in western society. We want power taken out of the government's hands so that it can be handed to companies who are entirely dependent upon, and therefore accountable to, the people. Their success is reliant upon the approval of the consumer. For this reason, companies are built specifically for and specialise in one thing: their product. Therefore, they are much better equipped to manage and run any specialised organisation. Of course, there needs to be a government regulatory body. But private management is simply cheaper, freer, more efficient and more effective.

Privately run PT = 21$ round trips


[31-Oct-17 09:11 PM] leaskie_leaskie#9989
@BellmanTGM the idea that private transport is any more effective than government is an abhorrent myth.

sorry @PineappleCrusher_ but this a pressing issue


[31-Oct-17 09:16 PM] leaskie_leaskie#9989
A sensible transport policy is a pillar of our "for the many" platform. A Socialist transport policy will follow through with our overall mixed-market solution, and work to lower fees for the worker.
We will create this platform by first nationalising most public transport services in Australia and running them as co-ops, so service can trump margins. Only government intervention can save our ailing systems.
We will then abolish transport fees - they defy the very principle of *public transport*, and only gouge commuters further.
We will also abolish toll roads where available. Drivers already pay for car and petrol - roads should be right.
We also will work towards building high speed rail between major capitals.

no need to stamp out tax avoidance if there is no tax

It's important to maintain a balance of supporting businesses, while ensuring they operate for the betterment of society. We will crack down on businesses and ensure they pay their fair share in tax. We also recongise how important businesses are in the economy and for the millions of Australians are emplyoed by them. We've advocated reducing the corporate tax rate to 25% for large corporations and 20% for SMEs. We want to ensure mum-and-dad businesses have a head up in the game, and recognise that a very large proportion of Australians  ae employed by these family-run businesses.

Every other leader on here tonight has committed themselves to increasing authoritarianism and taking the choice out of the people's hands. I have faith in the intelligence, in the independence, in the kindness, in the ability and in the work ethic of Australians. Australia is a free country, but we are seeing that challenged from every side. Vote BUP if you love a free country. Vote BUP if you believe in yourself. Vot BUP is you think government sucks.
