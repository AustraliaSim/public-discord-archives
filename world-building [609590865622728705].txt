[10-Aug-19 01:43 PM] Plupsnup#9685
The DPRPC invaded the capital, Pluto City, and Annexed the Frontier Federal Union in the mid 26th century. The remaining forces of the FFU retreated to Iris where they formed the Kuperian Provisional Republic. The KPR renamed to the KR in the late 30th century when an Armistice was signed between it and the DPRPC, ending a 400+ year long guerrila conflict

some of these states would struggle to have 10000 people, let alone a city you could call a capital

Venus is a matriarchal Oligarchy. There are 5 seats in the ruling council. Each seat on the council is ruled for life. Each nation sends a representative for their faction. The Council makes decision that could effect the whole planet, decree what rights everyone has and generally most of the universal laws of the world.


[20-Sep-20 10:03 PM] High Priest Liam#6655
Of course, other factions exist, but they lack positions on the council, thus, their factions wait for the death of their councilwoman, or, actively seek it.

And fill it to the brim with people with some handy data thanks to Iceland


[14-Nov-20 03:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
And I have done a butt load of research into pre-industrialised economies (ask me about salt), public revenue and spending, nordic culture (both in Skyrim and in real life) and going through pages and pages of Elder Scrolls lore which has so many gaping holes I've had to fill it all in with my own interpretation to help make the narrative fit

And why did Whiterun stay neutral


[14-Nov-20 03:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
The game provides some answers to these questions but my "worldbuilding" has provided far deeper and I think more interesting answers to some of these questions


[14-Nov-20 03:54 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Yeah it's told all in text in the game dialogue


[14-Nov-20 03:54 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
I think it's obvious why like


[14-Nov-20 03:54 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Dawnstar sided with the Stormcloaks


[14-Nov-20 03:54 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808
Just as it's obvious why Falkreath sided with the Empire


[14-Nov-20 03:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
That may be true and the game does provide a simple answer to a lot of the questions


[14-Nov-20 03:57 PM] Gregor The Beggar#0808

But the real world is hardly as simple as ‚ÄúUlfric is honourable and strong‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a murderer‚Äù - there is always lots of intricate complexities the game alludes to or hints at but I don‚Äôt think ever fully contextualised

Nah, NSW would still have a higher population, unless like nearly 800k people lived in the part of NSW Victoria would have had


[21-Nov-20 10:19 AM] Lach#9842
would probably be enough population for another electorate though


[21-Nov-20 10:19 AM] Lach#9842
which would probably look very similar to the current day Farrer, just streched more eastwards instead


[21-Nov-20 10:20 AM] Plupsnup#9685
I hate when people merge the Aboriginal colours for a single flag, keep the flags separate. plus there's always no Torres Strait Islander representation


[21-Nov-20 10:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well the region you‚Äôd pick up would add probably around the 100-200 mark

Yeah, Albury would be the vast majority of the increase


[21-Nov-20 10:20 AM] Deleted User#0000

[21-Nov-20 10:21 AM] Lach#9842
Actually with 250k increase, there's a chance that you'd potentially get 2 electorates more instead of just one

I reckon Palmerston is probably marginal CLP- maybe even marginal Labor- because there's a lot of rural areas that go to Labor, and Alice Springs is probably fairly safe because of the Palmerston areas


[27-Nov-20 07:50 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860

so i cant really like distribute them


[27-Nov-20 07:59 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
the reason i gave them to alice springs is because otherwise the population is like, high teens, and darwin has 30 something and palmerston has 20 something

did i accidentally do a gerrymanderer


[01-Dec-20 09:36 PM] mikiboss#2416
'accidentally'


[01-Dec-20 09:41 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
i think i initially started from hobart then broke quota, so i started from launceston where i had an SA3 that was basically a whole quota


[01-Dec-20 09:41 PM] mikiboss#2416
Ah lmao, I can see that now


[01-Dec-20 09:42 PM] mikiboss#2416
When you go for a place with Hobart's density first, it just absolutely mines into every other seats really, and you gotta pick and choose who gets eaten


[01-Dec-20 09:46 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
That seems to be what happened IRL, what I've gone with is 2 Hobart seats, 2 rural seats, and 2 rural-ish seats with Hobart fringes


[01-Dec-20 09:49 PM] mikiboss#2416
Yeah I mean i think the current set up works pretty well from my first glance


[01-Dec-20 09:49 PM] mikiboss#2416
I think that of the current seats, Braddon is the most *objectionable* one, yet I think that still is pretty viable


[01-Dec-20 09:49 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Queenstown and Swansea are the two hybrids, but Queenstown is definitely the more urban


[01-Dec-20 09:50 PM] mikiboss#2416
Absolutely


[01-Dec-20 09:50 PM] mikiboss#2416
I'm just nitpicking really


[01-Dec-20 09:50 PM] mikiboss#2416
I'm surprised hor far Swansea comes down on yours actually


[01-Dec-20 09:50 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Takes up about 30,000 voters from Hobart's south


[01-Dec-20 09:51 PM] mikiboss#2416
I suppose it makes sence when you carve our launceston, just never thought of it visualised like that


[01-Dec-20 09:51 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Swansea gets about 15,000


[01-Dec-20 09:53 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
Queenstown also takes a big area chunk from the Burnie - Ulverstone SA3, but population wise it's just to get both seats closer to quota


[01-Dec-20 09:54 PM] MerrilyPutrid#2860
i would reckon Queenstown is kinda safe Labor, while the other 3 are marginal Libs


[01-Dec-20 09:55 PM] mikiboss#2416
Yeah, Queenstown's northern area being a bit more lib leaning is way outmatched by the south

She was viewed sorta like a Tanya figure. Hasn't been in enough to justify being Leader, but had her own merits and carved herself out a spot


[25-Dec-20 09:46 PM] RookWilt#6643
Yeah


[25-Dec-20 09:46 PM] RookWilt#6643
But Kevin was also charismatic and popular


[25-Dec-20 09:46 PM] mikiboss#2416

[25-Dec-20 09:46 PM] RookWilt#6643
That as well


[25-Dec-20 09:47 PM] RookWilt#6643

Look, he was popular, but we all knew he was kinda insane behind closed doors


[25-Dec-20 09:48 PM] RookWilt#6643
Idk imma not make judgement because some say he was aight (I think sorry I‚Äôm like really tired Rn) and some beg to differ


[25-Dec-20 09:48 PM] RookWilt#6643

[25-Dec-20 09:48 PM] RookWilt#6643

[25-Dec-20 09:49 PM] RookWilt#6643

Is there any difference between the two, or are my eyes playing a trick on me?


[28-Dec-20 06:55 PM] Plupsnup#9685
the 'S' has rounded edges


[28-Dec-20 06:55 PM] mikiboss#2416
Ah, I can see that now


[28-Dec-20 06:56 PM] mikiboss#2416
I think the round edges look a bit smother, but that's just me


[28-Dec-20 06:56 PM] mikiboss#2416
I live them though quite a bit


[28-Dec-20 06:56 PM] mikiboss#2416
maybe make a bend at the bottom of the S like there is at the top of the S with the T just to see?


[28-Dec-20 06:57 PM] Plupsnup#9685
No, that's just the 'T' overlapping, otherwise it wouldn't fit


[28-Dec-20 06:58 PM] mikiboss#2416
Still I wonder what it would look like. Maybe just my leaning towards mirrored designs I guess

Probably Joel becoming LotO


[12-Feb-21 05:32 PM] BHjr132#2979
the initial green surge in early 2021 is after joel fitzgibbon gets elected labor leader. at the 2021 election its a hung parliament with only labor-greens as a viable majority but fitzgibbon refuses to do that so he steps down and plibersek becomes pm of labor-greens. fitzgibbon (and some other labor right) and scomo then team up to vonc the labor-greens government which is when labor falls below the greens

[12-Feb-21 05:35 PM] BHjr132#2979
after the labor government dies, fitzgibbon and his supporters rejoin the party and he is re-elected leader which is why he leads labor again in 2022


[12-Feb-21 05:36 PM] BHjr132#2979

The results of the most recent election were highly inconclusive and largely represent a distaste with the SWP government with the IPP and ENP. This pushed left wing supporters in Enet and Touko to support their own respective nationalist parties, while turning inner city residents, the base of the SWP towards City Vision and the Left. The Farmers Party could not compete with the rise of localist and nationalist parties within their bases of Enet and the confluence of the right wing vote in Higashiyama with the New Freedom Party

[16-Feb-21 01:32 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Government was then formed by City Vision and the Etenienne Nationalists


[16-Feb-21 01:32 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
with the Left joining at the last minute in exchange for cabinet positions


[16-Feb-21 01:33 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
With former partners the Socialist Workers and Islander People‚Äôs forced to the crossbench


[16-Feb-21 01:37 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
The CV-EN-L government passed legislation enabling the devolving of powers to a new Eten Parliament and constitutional recognition of the minorities


[16-Feb-21 01:38 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
Concessions to the Etenienne nationalists were broadly unpopular and created a situation where the urban east of the country had a growing unease with the willingness of left wing parties to work with Separtists


[16-Feb-21 01:38 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
This also divided ENP opinion as independence is the primary goal


[16-Feb-21 01:41 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
The New Gokoku Alliance which had been relegated to the sidelines was gaining in the polls during the term of this government, as well as other right wing parties such as New Freedom which was a eastern PLP splinter and the main Peoples Liberty Party.

The Etenienne are the former French colonialist population who colonised the Island of Eten in the North West, and after the arrival of the British in the East in Higashiyama, moved onto the main island of Elias, largely for farming


[16-Feb-21 02:03 PM] ky≈çsant≈ç#0087
The Shankaier people‚Äôs are largely mixed race European and Asian, who developed culturally seperate from both continents, after the arrival of convict labour from the UK and indentured servants from Asia. Largely residing on the Eastern side of the Country

[11-Jun-21 07:53 PM] RookWilt#6643
Head cannon;

In March 2022, the Liberals are engulfed in a massive corruption, and sleaze scandal. It is discovered that they are ensuring a massive corrupt police force run the country with the government involved with the policies corruption. That the Liberal Party, Government, and Prime Minister had been taking bribes in exchange for a whole wide range of things. 

Following this the NDP shot up the polls gaining 22 points in 6 months, and the conservatives making modest gains. This is due to the fact this entire made Canadians made them disillusioned with the big two parties, but to their credit they did run a good campaign to gain some ground, however the disillusionment, scandals, and the mood for change was masterfully taken advantage of.

Leaders;
Prior to the scandal breaking the NDP leader Jagmeet Singh suddenly resigned out of nowhere. The party desperate for someone who could connect with people and be seen as not connected with the scandal chose Rachel Notley after a #DraftNotley movement started and gained ground. She was elected leader on January 10th 2022.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was also removed on the 5th  of September 2023 by a scrambling and panicking Liberal party desperate to do anything to at-least hold onto any seat. He was replaced by Winnipeg South MP Jim Carr as the party hoped his status as a minister without portfolio and his other small tasks previously would help earn whatever trust they could.

All other parties stayed the same. 

Debate;
All party leaders attended the debates but each time it was agreed upon and voted that Notley dominated and wiped the floor with them. She also 'ripped O'Toole and Carr a new one each' which had a noticeable effect as we see a last minute dip in support for both the LPC and CPC.

Head cannon pt2.

Election Day;

As the nation goes to the polls there is a clear consensus in the mind of political experts and the public. That the NDP were going to win, the question was, by how much? Rachel Notley spent the day meeting and greeting voters in her home Province of Alberta trying to sure up support in seats they never thought they could win but now becoming clear that they could.  Prime Minister Carr was nowhere to be seen, and was widely suspected to be bracing and preparing for the massive revolt against the liberal party with close colleagues. Erin O'Toole, and other party leaders were mingling with voters in their ridings and going to winnable ridings meeting and greeting leaders.
And the results are in!

Head canon.

The 1st Notley term was seen as a huge success, record results in schools, shortest waiting times in hospitals on record, expansion to pharmacare etc, lower taxes on small business and working and middle class families
Quebec for some reason loved the NDP/Notley government
due to them basically investing money into the provinces, and Quebec liked this for reasons and actually helping them etc.
also CPC had some breakaways to form the new NCP, the New Conservative Party by hardliners who wanted to oppose everything. Which helped allow the NDP to do even better in AB and also the NDP gov actually invested in the prairies and helped fix their shit. Basically very based SocDem gov getting shit done. LPC made ground in ON and ATL because strong local candidates and just people pity voting them :agony:

Continuation of the 1st term Notley gov policies but voter fatigue starting to kick in as she runs for a 3rd term. CPC elected Carline Mulroney as their new leader. GPC keeping Annamie Paul but she is now running in Malpeque. No official LPC as the party falls further into chaos. BQ keeping Yves Francois blanchet for one more run.

On the 12th of July 2032 (Age 35 when elected leader) the CPC elected a new leader. Sam Oosterhoff (MP for West Niagara), who was seen as a breath of a fresh air for the CPC and helped the party take advantage of voter fatigue following nearly a decade of Notley/NDP government. Having also moderated the CPC accepting many of the NDP reforms and pledging to keep them, although this lead to a brief uptick in NCP support, more conservative voters realised this would only result in an NDP win and held their tongue and pledged support for the CPC. On the 18 of August, the LPC dissolved following consistently poor polling, election results, and low membership. On the 3rd of September the NDP elected a new leader following Rachel Notleys resignation after having been in office for 11 years. They elected Pierre-Luc Dusseault (Age 43 when elected - MP for Sherbrooke). Dusseaul was first elected in 2011 for the same seat before losing it in 2019 and then regaining it in 2023, and has held it ever since. Since 2026 he has served as a cabinet minister in Notleys governments.

Next Election;

NCP surge and NDP see steady growth as the CPC government fails to keep it promises managing to anger some moderates and more hardline conservatives. All leaders stay the same. The government also carries through numerous tough budgets implementing austerity across the country causing en masse riots and protests (reaching it's peak around early/mid to end of 2037)

1990 Australian Federal election (Australian Empire)

266 is Needed for a Majority
535 seats in the House of Representatives 
266 seats in the Senate.

But this is going to be indeed one of the Most Controversial elections as see in the Empire's History with the election of Zimbabwe's Former Premier Ian Smith to the Federal Parliament.

A lot of Australians including other ethnicities fears this as a possible Smith regime in a Few years, as we have seen in recent years, Former Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen endorsing the Christian Democrats 

John Howard said in a Statement including Prime Minister Bob Hawke, why would he Support a Leader who implemented Racist policies when he was Premier?! 
 
the Liberals Jim Bolger won Re-election in his seat of King Country in New Zealand

More to come soon in the Future of the Australian Empire.
