A new regulation is being pushed by the Minister For Foreign affairs, Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the socialist party, Drunk King Robert. This will prohibit the export of Military hardware to Saudi Arabia, this regulation will commence on the 7th of March. 

This regulation is softer than what would usually be expected from the Socialist party and is far better than an out right embargo or blanket tariff.

Aussie Conservative is struggling to setup the "Australian Conservative" party. What I dont understand, and I think many of you will agree, is why it wasnt simply named the "Australian Fascist party" as that is what they plainly are or at the very minimum are attempting to shape Australia too.

A group of bills under the label "Clean energy" are crawling their way through parliament, the intend on re-enacting the carbon tax as well as other emission regulations.


[05-Mar-19 09:11 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
The Left Coalition seem to be pushing for these bills while they still feebly grasp at a majority in the house.


[05-Mar-19 09:15 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
These bills will provide yet more hoops for businesses to jump through, discouraging growth and prosperity, of course any failures that will crop up because of these potential acts will be attributed to capitalism and increase dependency upon state-welfare as more people lose jobs and wages go down while cost of living drives up.

Manly-Kitten has been elected as representative for Brisbane, breaking the Left Coalition majority in the house and solidifying the hold of the emerging United Australia Party, which now holds as many seats as the Liberal party.

We have unconfirmed rumours that the Left Coalition will split between the Socialist party and the Social democratic party, Prime minister Youma is unsatisfied with her position as PM and DPM Drunk_King_Robert intends on issuing a vote of no confidence and acquiring Youma's positions. However whether these intentions are legitimate or not I doubt this will happen before the next general election.

Horror has defected from the Social Democrat party, the Central Alliance are now reconsidering their stance with the LC, it is likely they will choose to stop supporting them in parliament. That will make a swift -2 to the lefts total seats in the house.

Youmaton the sitting PM has called for an early election, the Liberal party is also VONC'ing Youmaton


[06-Mar-19 10:05 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
The left is in shambles, it is highly likely we will see a strong right wing government next term depending on the actions of the UDP who remain silent, the only left wing party going through unscathed tonight is the Socialist party


[06-Mar-19 10:06 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
We will ultimately be sitting with a much more radical but smaller left wing opposition next term.

Residents of cowper, the other parties have left your rights to rot. Not one of them have even considered repealing mining resource acts, of which allow the crown to force your hand and sell your property to any mining company that wishes to purchase the land whether you wish to sell or not. These laws are corrupt pro-corporation anti-people and anti-environment, the SDP havent given a shit about this coincidentally.

"There have been reports that Centre Alliance has entered into an Official Opposition agreement with the Socialist Party. This agreement has been brought to the party room, after an indirect request from Senator imnofox, and was rejected in a vote." "Centre Alliance is not in the Official Opposition alongside the Socialists and remains on the crossbench."

[21-Mar-19 11:49 PM] LuisAPI#8555
After TheGreatSenator's initial announcement of leaving the :uap:UAP,


[21-Mar-19 11:50 PM] LuisAPI#8555
he tweeted that he still respects the party, but is disappointed that we are merging with a party that aligned itself with the fascist AusCons.


[21-Mar-19 11:50 PM] LuisAPI#8555
And then Porridge tweeted that it was “no biggie” that he left our party, but will still vote as if he was. But then...


[21-Mar-19 11:51 PM] LuisAPI#8555
Porridge claimed that TheGreatSenator told him earlier to “hurry up the merger.” The claim in this tweet had no proof attached to it.

{Reactions}
🇫 🇦 🇰 🇪 📰 🗞 

[21-Mar-19 11:52 PM] LuisAPI#8555
While TheGreatSenator called it “fake news”, Porridge then claimed on Twitter that it was TGS who leaked the inaccurate information to Australia Tonight.


[21-Mar-19 11:53 PM] LuisAPI#8555
TheGreatSenator was then “surprised that the :liberal:Liberal Party haven't slammed [him] for speaking in favour of transgender rights,”


[21-Mar-19 11:54 PM] LuisAPI#8555
pointing out that the Liberals went from alt-right (and harboring self-proclaimed capitalist fascists like Griffo Jones) to libertarian (and willing to merge with a consistently libertarian party).


[21-Mar-19 11:56 PM] LuisAPI#8555
In response to n4ziporriidge earlier tweeting that he'll “let the Australian public decide who is the true propagator of fake news,” TheGreatSenator pointed out that the Australian public already did decide,


[21-Mar-19 11:56 PM] LuisAPI#8555
and they decided to elect TheGreatSenator as a senator...


[21-Mar-19 11:57 PM] LuisAPI#8555
...which somewhat doesn't make sense, considering n4ziporriidge ran in the House. This meant that Senator and n4zi were running for separate chambers of Parliament, and thus weren't mutually exclusive.


[21-Mar-19 11:57 PM] LuisAPI#8555
And here comes the personal insults. “The UAP decided tonight to merge with a party whos leader is named "n4ziporriidge". Was this because the Department of Births, Deaths and Marriages wouldn't accept "Nazi"?”


[21-Mar-19 11:58 PM] LuisAPI#8555
It is unknown why n4ziporriidge's parents chose that name for him. If anyone knows what his parents' contact info are, let @ReasonAus know, or let me know personally at @stranger195.


[21-Mar-19 11:59 PM] LuisAPI#8555
n4zi then sarcastically called the Senator for Tasmania ‘great’ by noting that he was elected third.


[22-Mar-19 12:01 AM] LuisAPI#8555
:uap:TheGreatSenator then claimed that he heard shouts of ‘HEIL FUHRER!’ coming out of the :liberal:Liberal Party's offices as he was walking out of them. :liberal:n4ziporriidge dismissed this as #FakeNews.


[22-Mar-19 12:03 AM] LuisAPI#8555

Despite how great this would have been in principle to see a libertarian party and a "liberal" party become one, I have decided to leave the party effective immediately.


[22-Mar-19 12:36 AM] LuisAPI#8555
The reason for this is the difference of opinion between myself and my libertarian views, and the Liberal Party leadership. Their past association with the Australian Conservatives has given me the evidence I need to know that this merge was not as good of an idea as I was lead to believe, and personally believed for a majority of merger proceedings.


[22-Mar-19 12:36 AM] LuisAPI#8555
As a libertarian, I cannot come to burden myself with being associated with a party that has neo-nazi and fascist associations, as they are not libertarian values.


[22-Mar-19 12:36 AM] LuisAPI#8555
The discussions that arose in these talks made it evident that the Liberal Party were not in favour of freedom of speech and freedom of opinion or debate. Their attempts to shut down any view I had made it impossible for me to be able to work with them.


[22-Mar-19 12:36 AM] LuisAPI#8555
It is for the proceeding reasons that I have decided to become an independent Senator for the people of Tasmania. Tasmania deserves a senator that will fight for the values that I was elected on. I hope a truly fully libertarian party can one day be established with representation in parliament, however with the one true libertarian party being brainwashed by the alt-right, I have lost hope.


[22-Mar-19 12:36 AM] LuisAPI#8555
As a libertarian must do, I will vote only in favour of bills that align with these values, which would mean going against that party, and I do not believe that would be viable.


[22-Mar-19 12:36 AM] LuisAPI#8555
I would like to thank BellmanTGM for his support and assistance in allowing me to reach my goals of becoming a senator. As the Leader of the United Australia Party I am in his debt.


[22-Mar-19 12:36 AM] LuisAPI#8555
I will always be a member of the United Australia Party at heart. They are my true party, and always will be, despite current events.

[22-Mar-19 12:38 AM] LuisAPI#8555
It's interesting to know that TheGreatSenator still sees the new Liberals with their purple-tainted past.


[22-Mar-19 12:38 AM] LuisAPI#8555
n4ziporriidge and the Liberal Party have repeatedly said on the campaign trail that they will not work with the AusCons.


[22-Mar-19 12:39 AM] LuisAPI#8555
And indeed it seemed at first that they followed through on that.


[22-Mar-19 12:39 AM] LuisAPI#8555
...until several Australian Conservative members (re)joined the Liberal Party, including Griffo himself.


[22-Mar-19 12:40 AM] LuisAPI#8555
Griffo was eventually removed from the party again, but the others were allowed to stay.


[22-Mar-19 12:41 AM] LuisAPI#8555
Presumably, the “discussions that arose in these talks” refer to the conversations he had with n4ziporriidge and PineappleCrusher_ on Twitter, the one we were reporting previously.


[22-Mar-19 12:41 AM] LuisAPI#8555
Indeed, there were personal attacks from both sides.


[22-Mar-19 12:42 AM] LuisAPI#8555
It isn't necessarily just one of the two parties that engaged in ad hominems,


[22-Mar-19 12:42 AM] LuisAPI#8555
with TGS mocking fun of n4ziporriidge's name, et al.


[22-Mar-19 12:43 AM] LuisAPI#8555
I'm glad that TheGreatSenator is and will still be a :uap:United Australian at heart and mind.

The :liberal:Liberal Party of Australia and the :uap:United Australia Party have merged into the Liberal Democrat Party.


[24-Mar-19 12:16 AM] LuisAPI#8555
We don't have a graphic of its logo yet, but it looks like the flag of Australia in the background embedded inside a shape that looks like Australia, with the yellow eagle and grey torch of the Libertarian Party of the United States in its front, somewhere centre-right.


[24-Mar-19 12:16 AM] LuisAPI#8555

[24-Mar-19 12:20 AM] LuisAPI#8555
Oh! Liberal Democrat leader Porridge just responded to Australia Tonight's inquiries.


[24-Mar-19 12:20 AM] LuisAPI#8555
As we at the UAP knew all along,


[24-Mar-19 12:21 AM] LuisAPI#8555
the new Federal Executive Council consists of :liberal:Porridge, :liberal:PineappleCrusher_, :uap:BellmanTGM, and :uap:Manly_Kitten.


[24-Mar-19 12:23 AM] LuisAPI#8555
As leaked by Australia Tonight, the former UAP got 50% of the representation, despite having three-tenths less members than the former Liberals.


[24-Mar-19 12:24 AM] LuisAPI#8555
Did you remember that BellmanTGM's Liberty Party was the party that eventually turned into PineappleCrusher_'s Liberal Party, the same :liberal:Liberals who merged with :uap:UAP to form the LDP.


[24-Mar-19 12:25 AM] LuisAPI#8555
The original Liberal Party was much less extremist and much more moderate than what it was in the end.


[24-Mar-19 12:26 AM] LuisAPI#8555
This can be seen with the likes of Senator Richard Nee, who is much more conservative


[24-Mar-19 12:26 AM] LuisAPI#8555
and has repeatedly shown fierce opposition to the merger.

Let's take a look at world news, shall we?


[24-Mar-19 11:04 PM] LuisAPI#8555
Motorcycle groups in the Philippines staged a massive "Unity Ride" this morning,


[24-Mar-19 11:04 PM] LuisAPI#8555
as President Rodrigo Duterte (PDP-Laban) has signed a "Motorcycle Crime Prevention Act",


[24-Mar-19 11:04 PM] LuisAPI#8555
which made license plates for motorcycles twice as big.


[24-Mar-19 11:05 PM] LuisAPI#8555
The measure was done as many riding-in-tandem shooters used motorcycles at night,


[24-Mar-19 11:05 PM] LuisAPI#8555
and supporters of the law say that this will make it easier for the police to check via CCTV.


[24-Mar-19 11:06 PM] LuisAPI#8555
Organizers of the protest at the People Power Monument say around 50,000 motorcyclists have joined,


[24-Mar-19 11:06 PM] LuisAPI#8555
calling the law "unconstitutional and discriminatory" as it only applies to motorcycles and not to other types of vehicles.


[24-Mar-19 11:06 PM] LuisAPI#8555
There were other motorcycles staged in many cities across the nation too,


[24-Mar-19 11:07 PM] LuisAPI#8555
with each gathering thousands of motorcyclists.


[24-Mar-19 11:08 PM] LuisAPI#8555
Motorcycle Rights Organization chair Jobert Bolanos claimed at a press briefing that Republic Act No. 11235 “criminalizes motorcyclists”.


[24-Mar-19 11:09 PM] LuisAPI#8555
The Unity Ride started at the People Power Monument in Quezon City, then proceeded to North EDSA, and ending somewhere in EDSA in Pasay City.


[24-Mar-19 11:09 PM] LuisAPI#8555
There were no police officers at the event.

Let's take a look at yesterday and today's news.


[27-Mar-19 02:16 PM] LuisAPI#8555
First off, yesterday afternoon, the Official Opposition released a


[27-Mar-19 02:16 PM] LuisAPI#8555
statement on the Socialist Party website calling for the Government


[27-Mar-19 02:16 PM] LuisAPI#8555
to condemn Israel's air raids on the Gaza Strip.


[27-Mar-19 02:17 PM] LuisAPI#8555
The air raids were done on the Hamas-controlled territory in


[27-Mar-19 02:17 PM] LuisAPI#8555
response to a devastating attack leaving people severely hurt.


[27-Mar-19 02:18 PM] LuisAPI#8555
“Israeli aircraft targeted two Hamas positions in the Gaza Strip early


[27-Mar-19 02:18 PM] LuisAPI#8555
on Sunday,” Al Jazeera reported this March 24.


[27-Mar-19 02:19 PM] LuisAPI#8555
“In response to multiple explosive devices that were hurled and


[27-Mar-19 02:19 PM] LuisAPI#8555
exploded during Gaza riots near Israel's border fence this evening, an


[27-Mar-19 02:19 PM] LuisAPI#8555
IDF aircraft targeted two Hamas observation posts in the southern


[27-Mar-19 02:19 PM] LuisAPI#8555
Gaza Strip,” a statement from the Israeli Defence Forces said.


[27-Mar-19 02:20 PM] LuisAPI#8555
The statement from the Socialist Party site further said that the


[27-Mar-19 02:20 PM] LuisAPI#8555
United Nations warned that the Hamas-governed territory of the


[27-Mar-19 02:21 PM] LuisAPI#8555
Gaza Strip will be uninhabitable by 2020, if the attacks continue on


[27-Mar-19 02:22 PM] LuisAPI#8555

[27-Mar-19 02:23 PM] LuisAPI#8555

The motion is as follows:
.


[27-Mar-19 05:58 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
I move that this House:
a) Condemns unprovoked bombings by the Israeli Air Force carried out on the 26th of March.
b) Acknowledges a 2015 UN Report which said the Gaza Strip would be "uninhabitable" by 2020 due to Israeli and Egyptian policies.
c) Notes that Israel has killed more than 200 peaceful protestors in less than a year.
d) Acknowledges that continued Israeli settlement results in land being stolen from Palestinians, and is a violation of peace agreements.
e) Affirms a commitment to a peaceful solution to the conflict, which is being actively undermined by Israeli policies.

As we tweeted out, there were 22 mentions of the phrase “point of order” in the House

floor; that's unusually high, and the session was criticized for its lack of questions.

And yeah, the SDP knew that I would often say some pretty vulgar stuff. And so they quietly removed me from cabinet so that if what happened during in QandA happened, they would look less like they supported me, or perhaps even that the implication is they didn't want me in the party anymore. I don't know. I can be a loose cannon, Youma knew I might anger some Socialists. So she told me to get out of the cabinet.

Now I have no idea why the Government shot down this bill, maby it was because they believed Ket and Ecstasy are quite dangerous, thats almost fair, they have a generally negative connotation in the media, dont want to lose those votes even if it means saving lives, right UDP and SDP?


[14-Apr-19 07:41 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
But what puzzles me, is if that was the reason, why didnt they amend for those exact substances to be removed


[14-Apr-19 07:42 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
so at LEAST medical entheogenic compounds such as shrooms, DMT or Salvia, to name a few can be legalised


[14-Apr-19 07:42 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
they have virtually no chance for addiction or fatal overdose


[14-Apr-19 07:43 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
Given the SUPPOSED progressive nature of the SDP that would be a fair call right?


[14-Apr-19 07:45 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
but no, apparently its not, meanwhile organised crime rubs its hands as the UDP and SDP's malicious naivety (or maby its intentional) puts money in their pockets

This is stranger195, here to recap the events of the day!


[16-Apr-19 10:32 PM] LuisAPI#8555
First up, **the Centre Alliance has been deregistered** by the

[16-Apr-19 10:34 PM] LuisAPI#8555

[16-Apr-19 10:37 PM] LuisAPI#8555

The Government has JUST announced they plan to forcefully seize economic/power production assets. They also imply that the economic planning for our energy production will be centralised, through government agencies.

Hold up, we are back.
The Government plans to increase the minimum wage to 25 dollars an hour.
I doubt this was conferred with any business, economic analyst or anyone who actually knows what the fuck their doing.
To force all businesses to give their workers over a 33% increase in their pay, based on an arbitrary number, will kill small businesses, this will play into the hands of the massive multinationals, their CEO's will still be raking in billions, however the small local businesses will keel over from the overheads. You will need a hedgefund to pay your workers 3 months of labour, limiting supply and competition for the consumer.
This is anti-small business policy coming from a supposedly """"pro small business"""" party

This is disastrous economic policy that was not thought out by an absolute shit party.

[17-May-19 05:34 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
This bill would protect (farmers in particular) from corporate tyranny


[17-May-19 05:35 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
Since, with current legislation, any property can be scooped up by a mining magnate with no say from the property owner


[17-May-19 05:36 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
this property could hold significant heirloom value to the owner


[17-May-19 05:37 PM] ManlyKitten#6380
